Yeah, usually I don't be the coolest dog in video games. Who's cooler than? I'm trying to think of as a lot of cool dogs in the dog from Duck Hunt. I would give over him. Okay, well, yeah, sure. Dr. Bennett. So he's second coolest. Talk about the dogs meet from Fallout Rad Dog. What about Shadow from Dead to Rights? No, Shadow, no. Until those cooler than him. Okay, for sure.

Yeah, if you give five dollars, you get it early. Yeah, if you give $10, you get a billion video and you don't want to do that. But for a dollar, you get the bonus episode. We're not even sure. Yeah, none of us still have Patreon. You know what? Maybe I'll run. It's not with the dollar this time, guy. Exact you eight. I'm sorry. I know it's a downward. Never mind.

The reason we're talking about them is that over on Patreon, they backed us at the Month of Shoutouts. Yes, I think our second ever Month of Shoutouts for somebody. So, yeah, Leapin' Tiger.

It's here's the best part about Leapin' Tiger in this app, right? Is that they're just getting started. Their startup just like Kinda Funny, a few months behind Kinda Funny. But I'm not gonna come for that starting up. So that no one's downloading the app yet because it's brand new. So what they're doing is these different game nights on every Wednesday. So Wednesday, 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time. So convert it to your timezone from 7 & 9. So the one with Tom right now is July 15th. Okay, yes, I believe you. I didn't do that much calendar work.

You'll hopefully be playing other Kinda Funny people because we're driving or me to do it. They're gonna pick some new in a PlayStation Vita. Mmm. So not only did they sponsor us, just make a cool app so you can play other gamers. They're also giving away a PlayStation Vita, which is pretty cool.

But bear with us 'cause we'll have a more in-depth conversation about it. Uh, Tom More who's staying over at GameSpot writes, \"We betrayed fans and want to be a brand again,\" says Sega CEO. And the story in part reads, \"Sega CEO Hajime Satomi, he has said that he believes the company but has betrayed the trust fans put in it over the last few years and edited is now aiming to improve the quality of its games in hopes of reestablishing himself as a valuable brand.\" Speaking in an interview with Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, which has been translated by Siliconera, Satomi said he has been discussing strategies to improve the quality of its games with employees.

I believe that if we can't maintain quality, it would be better not to release anything at all.\" That's one quote. And then he says later, quote, \"We did our best to build a relationship of mutual trust with older fans of Sega, but looking back, there have been some titles that have partially betrayed that trust. In the past ten years, Sega in the 90s was known for its brand, but after that, we've lost trust and we're left with nothing but reputation. We'd like to win back the trust and become a brand once again.\" So that's basically the meat of it is that the CEO of Sega, and I think he's been",

Yeah, he's been, I mean, I want to look because it says Hajime Satomi was the founder of Sammy Corporation. So in Sammy and Sega merged, presumably that that's when he became CEO. So yeah, it's interesting 'cause he's basically saying, eh, we didn't focus on quality, which is a bizarre admission, but nonetheless, an honest admission. Yeah, and that they're saying that they might not need to release all these games and maybe they shouldn't release games. Maybe it's better for their brand not to release some of these games.

Um, you know, they were a powerhouse for a very fleeting moment. That's what I think people kind of forget is that Sega, when they really Master System was getting trounced by the NES, they released the Genesis in '89, two years before the SNES came out. And no one cared. It wasn't until after they launched it again really with Sonic that in '91, '92, that people really started to pay attention to it. And then they had a few years of parity with Nintendo. And then they just disappeared again. And I, well, I'm a huge lover of the Dreamcast. So I thought that I have a grudge against Sega. I just think that his words are a little hollow to me in the sense that this would have been a good admission ten or fifteen years ago.

Yeah, the weird part about it is in what I said in Colin Live is that it sounds like a quote from a new CEO. It sounds like somebody who just started was like, hey, the other guy's **** things up. We're gonna get back to focusing on being a brand you can trust. It's not that would be super endearing of, hey, I'm the new guy and I know things have been bad here, but I'm changing and this is my vision for it to be the guy that's been there forever and say that maybe it's time to start thinking that way.

'Cause when I got here, I remember to San Francisco and started covering stuff like Sega coming through for appointments and doing this. And I remember they were like the first big layoffs that we covered that they like cut all their San Francisco PR. The side of the other kept moving offices and they weren't going to do this that dotted on. And like, you know, for me, the whole dot for them was Valkyria Chronicles that they were publishing that they never brought three over.

And my Sonic made money. Sonic sold. Yeah, for a long time. Did the quality? The game sucked. But like the games were selling. Yeah. And so I think that we're finally seeing with the last couple games, the sales have not been that good. Yeah. And the choices of going with the Wii U have not been smart.

No longer has hardware. Sega for a decade. Yeah, you know it. I feel like they need to to go back to making equality like quality games. Not quantity needs to go away. It needs to just be quality. And then they can finally get back to being something. But they're never going to be what they were. And I just at this point, it's the question of can they not be a joke? I think everyone knows they're a joke. But it's more like, is there anything they can do to fix that? I don't think there's enough time.

I would say most of their money is. And I was just that's why I was on my phone was I was looking at some stuff like Sega Sammy Holdings is like their company, like the whole company. And Sammy is a very profitable pachinko and amusement kind of company. So like they do they like very again, very similar to Konami. They just do other ****. They're holding company. So like they just have lots of subsidiaries that don't have any be doing video games. And that's where they make their money. But I think they've lost focus. Here's the thing.

I went back and bought things like Genesis later on and on eBay when I was in high school. And and obviously played. I even traded my SNES for my Genesis for a French Genesis for like a while until I got in trouble on it. And I switched back when I was a kid. My parents find that. Yeah. And I was like, what?

It was the first time Nintendo was ever scared by anyone. Till PlayStation almost put them out of business. And there's something admirable about that. But I think we give Sega too much credit. And I think we have for a very long time. And I've always felt that way. Sega has never been on Nintendo's level ever. Um, they've been a publisher of wide array of games, including some internally developed games. And some of them I really love, i.e., Phantasy Star. But they've never had like a quality offering that rivals any of the big publishers or any of the big developers that you respect.

Crazy Taxi is another example. You know, and and they deserve some credit. Like they were they were the guys that would publish PlatinumGames' games when no one would touch Platinum. You know, like when Platinum was an unknown unknown quantity. I appreciate those guys. Think so. I'm not necessarily trying to **** on them from like from a base level. There's good people that work there. They're attached. I work there. It's just that, you know, we talk about Nintendo for instance. Nintendo and Sega are similar in the sense that they both come from a similar heritage, a shared heritage and often and shared a lot of barbs with each other.

To me, Sega doesn't have any of that. They do not have the talent that Nintendo has. They do not have the talent that a lot of big third-party publishers have in terms of their own array of studios with the exception of Atlus. And Atlus, of course, owning Persona Team and a few other really important IP is really going to be their salvation in the video game space. And I think everyone knows that. And someone who pointed out to me that in the Siliconera and the Famitsu original story, it apparently says, although not reflected in that GameSpot story, that they have been learning from Atlus about the way Atlus deals with its games and takes its time, i.e., Persona",

I don't care what you do with Sonic. It's not going to be relevant beyond uh, you know, a small group of people or kids or whatever. Like Sonic has been run into the ground to such a significant degree that it'll never be Mario again the way it used to be. You know, I mean, I'll never know. Never. Why? That's my thing though, is like, that's that's a fact. It never will. But I don't think that it is helpless in the fact of being something that's relevant.

And I think that that's important. And in fact, there was all these Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games and all that stuff, like keeping the character relevant. Like Sonic is something that people know. Like little kids, they know who Sonic is. He's had cartoons almost consistently from the 90s. Sure. And that's what's popular about him now with the cartoons and not the games, which is a dangerous place, I think, from them to be because that's fickle gate.

And I like just because he sells games that sell a few million copies here, whatever, once in a while or has a cartoon that's big with some kids, does not make him a relevant force for Sega. And I think that's one of the things that they've not been able to latch on to is that they need to figure something out. They should put Sonic away a long time. But that's only the only thing that makes money out of this gaming portfolio. And that's things like they need to put them away. But at the same time, it's like they can't. They just need to fix it.

I don't know how that could even happen because honestly, I don't think it's possible. And as a huge Sonic fan, I love Sonic. Like the Genesis games for sure. I love those games. They're not Mario World. They never were. So it's like with this, if they were to make a new Sonic game that is good, it's never going to be the same level of Galaxy. But I'm just saying it needs to be the Galaxy, the Galaxy-fication of Sonic. So just that level of boost because then when you look at the 3D Sonic games, they've never understood what to do with it.

Then you start getting into the they played with the like 2D and like just running really fast things. Fun. It just doesn't warrant a full game.

And one thing in terms of a new Sonic game coming out and having gamers, I really like Sonic is a thing again. I care. Yeah, I don't know. Like I don't. There's no way that anyone will ever make you care about Sonic. No, I mean, maybe they could. I try to be open-minded. I just think Sega has been a victim for a long time of being too big for its britches in terms of like",
