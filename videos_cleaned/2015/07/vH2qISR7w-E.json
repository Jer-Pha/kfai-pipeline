We did do a little San Diego Comic-Con. We had ran around, did a whole bunch of different stuff, met a whole bunch of different people, didn't play too many games. We did have one little opportunity to play some stuff. We played with the Morpheus and we played a little bit of Battlefront. Did you get to play Battlefront at all? Battlefront, I played for like five minutes. Okay, it looks awesome. It's super cool. Yeah, we did a little split screen. Uh, Nick had a problem. Yeah, me and Nick did, couldn't invert. Yeah, Nick couldn't invert, which is some **** though. They should no, Nick sucks. I hate it when demos don't have the option to let you like do something that simple. Sure, like I understand I hate that Nick sucks. Uh, I would play, but you'd be all right. Remember that one day where you started thinking inverted just out of the blue anyways that was cool and all but",

Have you played it before, Colin? Yes, okay, several times. Have you played it before? Yes, this is my first time playing it since New York Comic-Con, so I've missed a lot of stuff. This is my first time using Morpheus. I've used Oculus before and what's that other one? There's another one, but I don't remember it. There's another big one, Gear, the the Gear VR headset. I've never used, never used that one. Um, Hollow Lens and then Brandon, Brandon Lch, oh he has his whole thing going. So me and Nick did a demo of that3 last year. So I'm familiar enough with all this VR stuff and we've talked about VR a million times in the sense that it's you know more gimmicky than gamery and like what are the real applications for all this and all that",

Having said that, we played it and all of us had huge smiles on our faces and were in love with it. Yeah, thought it was super fun and then we all left, we talked about it for a bit and we're like, oh this is so great and that was cool and this is cool. Yeah, but do you want no, not really. Yeah, yeah, you know, yeah, let me know your experiences. Well here's what I want to lay out that this this is a a golden tidbit that I mentioned to you guys and you and I heard Nick say you I had headphones on, we can't see what you're seeing and I never told you and then this is this is one of those things that don't get me wrong, maybe this is just in there to begin with, but we have something to do with this.

It's just a stupid on the rails thing where I'm smashing my head into things great. But in the part where I'm just waiting for the game to start, right? You're in this area and you're looking around and there's all the buildings with the little dudes, you remember these guys that are in the controller, they're the they're in the playroom thing doing their thing and I **** you not, I look over here Colin and there's a little dude watching TV and on his nightstand is a frame that that framed photo this Frame photo of Shu Yoshida and like granted this is the the shoe photo you see all the time everywhere, but like in a frame right and like we were the who brought that into the",

Like it's things like that that make Morpheus cool that make it go like from all right, whatever I just I'm in this video game to this is a world I'm in a world there's all these cool little things to look at. I think the funnest part is there's that moment when you put it on and it's just like oh God I don't like this it's not in focus things don't look qu it's just kind weird and then you're in the world you're over that you stop thinking about it it's like oh **** I'm just in this world right so looking over and seeing pictures looking over and seeing all this different stuff it's giving you things to focus on and make you forget that you have the stupid for me it's whenever",
