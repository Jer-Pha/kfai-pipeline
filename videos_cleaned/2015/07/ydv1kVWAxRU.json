Yes, I well hold on, see there's here's the problem with these uh things, they always have their question, but it's surrounded by a bunch of like notes to us and all this stuff, so I don't even know the context of this cuz you just copy and pasted in.

I I'm going to do that, but anyway, my topic is with the four main gaming companies, SLS Services, Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC AKA Steam. Steam, do you guys see a future where any of them merge together or buy each other and do you think they should? For example, Nintendo publishing games for PlayStation or Steam store on Xbox. Colin, I don't merging, no. I making games for each other, sure. Uh, I think Nintendo is obviously the most likely culprit to make games for someone else, um, out of that group of four. Uh, individual Steam, I I think, uh, is so ingenious and makes so much money that there's no reason for them to do anything. I think that if they just like kind of held Pat that they'd be fine, although I I still wonder what the future of PC gaming is ultimately when compared to console gaming as well. I don't know that either of them are necessarily safe",

I don't know that either of them are necessarily safe and what I mean by that is that there might be some sort of ubiquitous gaming apparatus in the future, a unified console that is neither that is neither necessarily a console nor PC that is just something you plug into a TV or plug into a monitor or whatever. So I don't know that I don't think any of them are necessarily safe from one another. Um, I think people talk about PC gaming as having longer legs and I think that's probably true, but I think that, um, ultimately all these guys if they want to survive in this space will'll be making games for one system in the future. I just don't know when. I think people thought that that might have even been now, um, 10 years ago for instance, um, yet we are still in this space, so who the **** really knows? But Microsoft I think it's likely that Microsoft",

But Microsoft I think it's likely that Microsoft sells Xbox at some point. That that's been rumored for a long time and I think that that's entirely possible. Uh, Sony makes so much money off a PlayStation compared to what Microsoft makes on Xbox that they kind of need them although I think it's possible that they spin off eventually as well. Um, and then Nintendo I think you know we'll see what happens with NX, but I I think that uh um I don't think it's it's out of this world at all to consider the fact that they'll probably be making games for those two guys um if NX fails. Yeah, that's I mean I think the fact how it will go down right that Nintendo will eventually end up putting games everywhere becoming Sega .0 but being successful going out and doing that and then yeah they're not going to get bought they're going to still have money in",

I think the most likely scenario he has in there would be yeah Xbox doing something with Steam, you know what I mean? That's interesting. I've never even really thought about that. I don't know how it would work though because just the the fact of the you need the controller sure compared to but that's the whole thing with Steam, the Steam boxes and their controller and all that goofy stuff, right? I mean there is a Big Picture Mode like I it's not out of the realm of possibilities to think about there being CL you know the what how do you compete with Guai or whatever you know PlayStation Now not that you really need to",

Well think of that's not likely but just like hypothesizing on what could happen if Nintendo were to actually merge with one of the companies do you think that there'd be a major difference between Nintendo merging with PlayStation or merging with Xbox what I mean in terms of like equal like what the companies would look like in ter yeah I mean whoever emerged with would be that'd be **** insane and that would be",
