Thank you, Bruce, for your support on Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames. Sorry, our little video is a bit later than we wanted it to be. Kevin Dunkle is in the service. Yes, yes, for the Navy. Oh, so is he like, this is a problem. Can you don't want, I don't want to say the wrong things. Very got, you don't have enough information on your Patreon page here. No Twitter, no Facebook yet. The link to it's gotta be Navy, Red Dodge, the Coast Guard. Were the same out uniforms as naval? No, it's away . Yes, got a Navy. Yeah, that's my assumption. It's just I don't want to offend someone in the Coach Jake Long image was gunning by Kevin by appreciating a service. No, but if it's like , if you call Marine soldiers, I think that would really fence. I know personally alone, that's'cause they're Marines. Exactly. But what do you call Ranger? Ranger Parker? They're coming. So, soldier, probably. What about a Navy SEAL? He's a naval officer, a SEAL. Mm-hmm.",

He has five tweets. Games, chicks. It's great fun facts. It's gotta be him. But he hasn't tweeted since 2011. But nonetheless, my assumption is some Navy making you smile. Games, chicks, and random funny toy / where the Navy takes me. This must be him. See , I like this detective work we're doing. You are a gumshoe, Greg. True Detective. True. Um, do you guys know where the term gumshoe comes from? Gum gets on the sheet on this detective. She wants when he was going through a crime scene and they wouldn't have found a clue stuck between the floorboards except the gum got down there, grabbed it, yanked it up and like, holy shit, the killer's name was Charlie make it is.",

Exactly how they solve those murders. Yes, Charlie beds. That's how nice she was. How I solve this murder. Yeah, the household slaughtered and he left a piece of paper with name underneath the floorboards. I said, \" I did it.\" I look for the guy that carved the swastika in his forehead. That's me, Charlie Manson. Good. P.S. This floorboard squeaks. You should buy. Get down like that. Oh my goodness gracious. What a fun time. What was that call with those murderers called? The something hangs a favor like, now they were like the, I thought I was just, I don't know. Manson, Penny More. No , the Manson. It's like a massacre. Kevin, why don't you ask your shitty watch? Okay, well, tell me who Google, huh? Like, I like what I call him, Charlie Manson killers. It comes back. It's like, if you want a Swanson TV dinner, go to the stock. If you",

So, though, it's all, it's all perfectly legal. It's all perfectly legal. Kevin Dunkle, we don't know much else about you, but you seem like a great young man. Thank you for your service. Yep. And thank you for supporting this stupid show and this awesome endeavor that we have going on right now. That this also may be stupid. Uh, I wish I knew more about you , but you only follow, well, he only follows six people, right? But he followed Platonic. I, I wonder if he did this recently, right? Let me,'cause yeah, he hasn't been on here at all today. Like, I'm confused by this. So I want to know more about them. So, files I'm cooking, though. I want to use one father when you don't the Platonic thing. Okay, what the hell's going",

Okay, what the hell's going on in that picture? Followers and Leigh Leigh. Larry Code. Larry Code isn't a real blogger, undergraduate in electronics and telecommunications, who hasn't used his Twitter account since February 10th, when he tweeted out a bunch of things that are clearly not from him. So, let's see when the last time you actually tweeted something that, that he meant to tweet out, because I want to know more about this. Looks like that YouTube video in a minute. It's unclear right now. These are all spam tweets. I can't. You're right. It's unclear. Somebody's, if you see Larry on your boat, tell Larry he's been hacked. Shout out to Larry. Shout out to Kevin Dunkle. Thank you for your support, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. You up?",
