At first, I was going to call him, um, the Scottish Brogue. But, uh, I, I noticed that that's just a button-down shirt that's a little too long for him, which was like a mind-blowing thing a couple years ago when everyone realized, oh, it's not a kilt.

For those of you who aren't familiar with that specific group of islands, uh, the crazy part about it is that he, um, has always worn those shorts. He doesn't know where he got them from. Okay. But it was his destiny. He's always felt to wear those shorts anywhere he goes. Wears the shorts. Wears shorts when he got married. Wear the shorts when he got divorced. He wears the shorts everywhere he goes. He wears the shorts until one day when a group of crazy, uh, uh, uh, like gorillas assaulted the islands, right? And he had to escape from them. And then he goes, he goes, he goes, and he just happened to find a sign that looked exactly like those shorts. And so he stood up against it as they ran by, and they couldn't see him. And so, true story, those shorts saved his life. He was later killed by those gorillas because the shirt actually didn't match the rest of it. It stood out like a sore thumb. Yes. Yeah.
