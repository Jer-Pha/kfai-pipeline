So if you're at San Diego, we have a bunch of stuff you can come do with us and you don't even have to have a Comic-Con badge. On Thursday, we're going to Polite Provisions.

Friday, we're doing The GameOverGreggy Show at Petco Park as part of Geek and Sundry Studio Stage. No Comic-Con badges required. We're doing that at 3:00 p.m. And then I'm moderating a whole bunch of Comic-Con panels if you do have a Comic-Con badge. So come hang out with me in the convention center.

'Cause when there are so many bronzes, then there's fewer room for the gold and the silvers, of course. Um, there is an enormous amount of trophies in that game. Yeah. Um, 'cause that's why I was surprised when you're like, I only have 30% of the trophies. I'm like, how is that possible? Yeah, but I've been playing. I have I think 18 trophies and it's only like 21% or something like that. I'm like, all right. Last night I was driving the Batmobile around when us running up these final Riddler trophies, slid off of a like overpass, fell down on two wheels and a trophy popped.

Well, see that's but but I like that sometimes trophies like you didn't know what they were. H, like there was two things with PS3 because the trophies would have to they were loading on a separate a separate thing. So it would take a time for a pop. There were two things with that. A, like the nervousness of you knew you did something and it's like, is it going to happen? Is it going to work? Some trophies 'cause some trophies wouldn't and it would take like forever sometimes for a trophy to pop. Like, what the ****? And then the other thing was like the trophy would randomly popping.

I was like, oh no. And I wait, it wasn't loading icons and then it was showing the one I just popped is not being done. Arkham Knight is is whacking out PS4s, man. I'm telling you. It it catastrophically crashed my PS4 as we talked about on Colin Live today. Yeah, now the thing about that is like like worst than any games ever crashed my PS4.

Yeah, it's really weird. It's weird to want get the heart of the matter. Like, yeah, let's let's actually we want to hear their their thoughts on whatever. But maybe it's just a best friend throwing up the flare so that when we do get the random person who clicks for no reason to go hear what we're about to talk about, they don't come into the gay marriage topic and hear about Batman: Arkham Knight for a while and Batmobile trophies. It's not it's a complainer complaining. It's it's a whiner being a whiner. Haters are going to hate and you know what? Great. Let them hate and watch the money pile up. 50 with a bottle of BB.

And so we thought we would go again. And what was so interesting uh last week is that two significant issues came across or came out of the Supreme Court. I mean, they give a they render a lot of decisions at the same time. No one cares about any of those. Um, how often is the Supreme Court decision coming around? They I mean, pretty often.

But uh we talked about the Confederate flag, which is not a which is not really a a constitutional issue as much as it's just a uh issue of good taste.

Um, but the Supreme Court said that that according to uh the 14th Amendment, the um which is one of the Civil War amendments, um that it is, you know, unconstitutional to deny a gay person the right to marry another gay person.

This this is a very symbolic thing for the gay rights movement. I was even reading a piece um and I don't know if it was from Andrew Sullivan or someone where where he was writing like, there's a little bit of remorse in the gay community right now because they don't feel what one of the things that rallied them for so many decades as a community and kind of uplifting each other was how they were different and how they were they had a fight to fight.

And then like I started commenting to that person and then within 45 minutes he deleted his Twitter account because everyone was coming to him and he was like, I've never been more bullied than before.

You assume that 'cause Caitlyn Jenner is a man, was a man and wants to be and feels a woman, becomes a woman, that he is therefore gay. But he says that he's not. Nope. You know?
