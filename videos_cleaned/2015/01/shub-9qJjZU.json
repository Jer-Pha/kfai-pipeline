We just saw Ori and the Blind Forest. Let me tell you what, Greg. I'm very happy that I'm not that forced cuz this game is beautiful. Oh, I get it. Kind of the blind. That was a reach. No, in the Blind Forest, a very, very beautiful game. I got to host like a live demo of it at E3, but this is my first time playing it and jumping into it, running around playing, I'm like, \"Oh, this is fun.\" And then we jumped to a later level and it broke my brain. Yes. In a good way, though. Yeah. Here's my thing. It feels like a lot of games that I like. It has the floatiness and beautifulness of Rayman Origins. Oh, I think it looks better than Rayman. Personally, and I think Raymond looks great. This is beautiful. Right. But the float, it feels like it in a lot of ways. Just the flowiness and the controls and stuff, which is",

Just the flowiness and the controls and stuff, which is cool. Yes. Exactly. It also feels like the later level you're talking about. It's like if you take Mario Galaxy and Portal and put them in a 2D platforming Metroidvania style game. Yeah. Bam. Sign me up. That's the thing. Metroid style, Metroid Van, you're running through come back and be able to access stuff once you've unlocked new powers. And I know we're talking about how beautiful it is, and I know it's cliche to say it, but it really is like playing a cartoon. It looks so good running and in motion stuff. And it's I don't know you we don't know exactly the story it's telling you, but you're walking and all of a sudden this like ghostly voice pops up and starts telling you a story and you see it and there's spirits of life and all these different places. Yeah. Yeah. So, I did a little",

So, I did a little backwards and I started playing with the later level before I went back and that was tough, but it was one of those things where it kind of it felt right at the same time cuz you felt like the superpowered up, you know, later in the game, so you have all these powers and cool stuff. Then later when I went back to the first one, I was like, \"Ah, okay, I see where this is going to go like.\" Yeah. So, it it's cool how the three distinct levels that there are felt very different. There was different challenges and different types of things going on and yeah, it's it's good. Yeah. Ori and the Blind Forest out March 11 th. Uh 20 bucks going to break your brain in the best way possible. Cuz it's just like all of a sudden, you know, the game seems like it's starting off normal, right? Left to right,",

And then when you've got to go up and over and you're sticking to the ceiling and you're running, but then you got to drop the orb to get around the thing, but then pick it back. Oh jeez, Louise. Yeah, it's good. I'm excited. Everybody, let us know in the comments what you think of it. And then for everything about cool video games, keep coming back to Kinda Funny games. Heat. Heat. [Music]",
