No, it was he was in the the dog movie, Dog Hunter, Dog Knight. What the hell was it? Do you have the phone? You can look it up. But that's similar to it. But he he exploded onto the scene with Superman Returns. And I was like, here we go. This is the Superman in the movies for the rest of my life. This is going to be this guy. I of course devoured Superman Returns information, you know what I mean? Like the Singer Vlogs he put up, every article about it. Singer's saying he met Routh and he tipped over his milk or whatever and the creamer. It was very Clark Kent moment. They said it was very cute. And then of course there was photos when he was like, you know, when he was just we had a Halloween party, a normal dude, and he went as Clark Kent with a Superman shirt and was like, he still growing out the curl. Exactly. He it was like, yes, this guy is from he was from Iowa, raised",

He it was like, yes, this guy is from he was from Iowa, raised on a farm too, you know what I mean? He had like the Smallville backgr. I was like, I like everything that's going to happen with this guy. You watch the movie, his performance is a great performance of Superman in the kind of film they were making. I have I have a laundry list of reasons Superman Returns doesn't work for me, but Routh's performance is not one of them. He's really good as being he's doing a Christopher Reeve impression. I mean, like that's what because that's what they're doing. They're doing a sequel to those movies and he's doing incredibly well. He's doing a very good alien Superman, which isn't my kind of thing . I like, you know, Superman who thinks he's more American or more of our world, right? He's protecting Earth. But all that aside, Brandon Routh was awesome. Superman Returns wasn't good.",

Superman Returns wasn't good. Singer was saying super the next Superman was going to be like Wrath of Khan style action. I was like, I am on board. And then it all exploded . Every the public turned on Superman Returns. It never went anywhere. Routh was faded away, right? And he did the science what is it called? I'm sorry, Dylan Dog, Dylan Dog: Dead of Night, which I always thought was weird because he went and did that movie with uh the guy who plays Jimmy Olsen. He did Sam Huntington did. And I was like, that's a weird that's neat but weird. And then they turns out they're like really good friends now. It's like, Yay Universe. No, no, no, not at all. Thank you for trying to get me on that though. You got got me to smile. So he went off, he did that. It seemed like he was fading away. Like what's he going to do?

And then pow, out of the blue, shows up on Arrow. Yeah, he's he's Dr. Ray Palmer, small thing, spoilers. Ah, he's going to be the Atom. And now there's talk of the Atom getting his own spin-off show. Da. What's queuing all this up? Where I want to talk about the man, the myth, the legend, Brandon Routh, is the fact that that last night IGN tweeted out a video between Stax and Joshua about like, is this the redemption story of Brandon superhero redemption story of Brandon Routh? I immediately responded, yes. The content of the video was very positive that yes, this clearly is you. If they're going to do Atom spinoff, this is great for him.

Someone who was in this movie that was supposed to make this is going to make your career. You are going to be Superman that was so much for him to take on as an actor, right? Of like, you're stepping into these boots and only a handful of people have ever portrayed this and you're going to be this guy for the new generation. All people **** Superman and then it's just gone. It's like, you know, I mean, that would be the most depressing thing for me is that it's all just over. Yeah, I mean, I'm I'm with you on the Superman Returns in that when you watch that film, he is undoubtedly, I think the best part of it. Oh, sure.

I think I liked him more as Superman than Henry Cavill, who plays a lot more brutish Superman is a lot more ra a film. Also, we're seeing that sort of again with Henry Cavill, right? If if there was no Dawn of Justice, his career probably would not have I don't know that it would have skyrocketed like you have um I'm trying to think of another role that has sort of made or break people's careers. Batman. Yeah, I guess Batman M right? He looked in a different different light after Batman. Um he was Bale for sure. Uh Bale for sure as well. Bale kind of went from being ever heard Mega star.

But like he got the second chance. Not let alone a second chance in the DC Universe. Do we yeah, I mean, and that's the thing too is if you'd have asked me that question two to three years ago, I I said no, it's TV. It's not anywhere close to as important as film. But now and everyone is saying this and Colin, you've mentioned it multiple multiple times, all the great stories are now unfolding on TV. That's what films is a little bit it's it's still good, but TV's had this sort of resurgence. There a Renaissance happening where we're getting great stories like Arrow or Flash, which is good too.
