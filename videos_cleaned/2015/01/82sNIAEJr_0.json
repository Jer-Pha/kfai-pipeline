      "text": "[ Music] speaking of demands of the market, Tim, there was a lot of demands for Majora's Mask to come through the best Zelda. Yes, I don't know about the best Zelda game. I I enjoy it a lot. It's my favorite Zelda G second second best. I liked it use of The Color Purple. Yeah, yeah, it was a big fan of that. I remember there was a Nintendo Power issue and I was like w cover I've never seen purple this way. Okay, um anyways, so they announced this week that there's going to be a little statue that you get a collectible statue if you pre-order the game. It's $50 and you get a little little tiny dude beautiful looking statue and the game. Now my question to you guys, when do we draw the line with this collector's edition ridiculousness? Because this is pretty innocent as far as I'm concerned. We're not getting any like like it could have came with a Major's mask that like turns into a little deu shrub, but they didn't do that cuz that's dumb. Yeah, I mean having a little Skull Kid it's kind of cool. I think you",

I think you know, I'm I'm I'm often in my mind I've never really talked about never put in words, but I'm often frustrated with Collector's Editions and limited editions and all these kinds of things. I I think that a lot of them are just ridiculous and they're waste of money and I don't understand why people want this stuff. But when I see something like that for one of my favorite games of all time, I'm looking at it sorry. Yeah, um or I see something from Uncharted or I see something from Mega Man or something I really love that I'd have to pay a little bit more for. I have a Drake statue. I have a I have a Jolan Ellie statue . It's like I think I'm maybe just being judgmental about the games that I don't care about that much.

I often wonder and and I think the market is shown or at least Publishers have shown the propensity to make them because they're making money on them clearly. Yeah, um that it's a useful tool to get people to pre-order your game, you know, and for some reason for consumers pre-orders matter to some consumers and for obvious reasons pre-orders matter uh to the Publishers. Yeah, I can't think off the top of I mean guess there's I'm looking over there at my uh get Destiny Ghost that was if you want to grab grab get he's tethered. Tim can get over there.
