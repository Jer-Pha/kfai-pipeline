You want to say anything anymore? No, I could have. It was, it's too early. You have a, we finally made you a shirt. There's the, we had the Shadow Boxing one, but that sucked. Now you got the Producer/Seducer shirt. Yeah, we did. Um, how many times have you said that? 57, 58 times now. And then Kevin Smith says it's cool and then I was like, we got to get that shirt up. Got shirt up. We didn't even promote it the day the shirt went live. KindaFunny.com. That's true. Over here, the pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty. Understand, I'm not anyone to trifle with. Yeah, so good. I want you to know that's prep today for the Game App one. Tim Gettys, yo, you don't have to say let Tim host anymore. You host the games. I know. I'm hosting things. It's pretty cool.

Thank you so much. Or G, uh, but this is us recording three days, I guess more like two days and an hour into life after quitting IGN, starting a second Patreon, doing all these interviews, going on GameSpot, putting out these videos, doing the Kevin Smith podcast, having two more podcasts. Oh, it's crazy. I remember over the weekend saying to Christine when I was working really hard on Sunday and like staying up to 1:00 in the morning, don't worry, after this it'll slow down. This week has been 99 miles an hour. Yeah, it's crazy. And I don't see any end, but it's fun though. It's so much fun. Once we get the rhythm down of what we're doing, that'll be a different story.

What we need to come up with this, this is Kinda Funny in action right here, is a plan for the Patreon pages communicating to those people because historically it's always been me and maybe this week will is not how every week will be, but there's like 186 emails in the business account.

Yeah, I've seen my Twitter was blowing up with people like, wow, this. Oh, word of mouth. Like I give a **** what Alfredo thinks of Agent Carter. They dropped a teaser for this last week and this time, I guess it would be two weeks ago, but uh, they were saying it was coming in an Asian. Yeah, it was on IMDb. I saw Ant-Size teaser.

Um, but not like in a cheap CG way, just in a like feel way, which we haven't really seen in the Marvel Universe. Yeah, it's usually just explosions and blue glowing things.

Speaking of pencils, Greg, way that Ant-Man can shrink to the size of a pencil. I think it's going to be good. I think Paul Rudd has a great casting choice for this. I would have liked to have seen what Edgar Wright would have done with it, but apparently that's just not in the cards. That's really upsetting. When did he leave in the, in it? Like at what point? The production developing it, I believe. And I guess they got to some creative differences and they within the span of a week, he was off the project.

So it's like developing a whole other. So who do you think the reference they reference in there is not, I'm not talking about the after credit scene, but there has to be like, oh, I shrunk to the size of the. That's crazy. That's what we used to say about the Hulk or some **** like that. Peyton Reed, not Alexander Payne. Peyton Reed about that, man. Really big.

So they had, they sold off the rights all their major characters, basically with the exception of Avengers. Biggest characters, Spider-Man and Wolverine, X-Men. Yeah, so they never can do X-Men again. They're, they're never going to do. They're not going to do X-Men, but they might get Spider-Man back. Sony's hurting right now. Yes, they're not. They certainly are. So I guess that, that gives me a little bit of context as to why then much needed context about why they would go into the bowels of these like, never heard of Ant-Man in my life. You so like, like the character, I guess looks, the character like looks cool. The, the suit looks cool. But like this is, this seems kind of corny to me. Like I, I like, I don't, I don't know.

Now here's the here's now here's now here's the bigger mystery is that he's the Ant-Man, but he's riding the ant. Now it looks like he's riding either an ant that hasn't yet mated with the queen because the the ant has wings and of course as you know ants lose their wings they mate. You know, you know, conversation with Colin, first ever episode. As far as I understand, male ants when they mate with the queen like they mate there's some name for it. I don't remember what it is. They mate with no, there's like some they swarm or something like that.

So actually he's like he's almost like a subatomic particle at this point is I guess is what I'm saying. So there's a lot of scientific questions. I about every ant doesn't have wings though, right? Like the picnic ants in our house didn't start with wings on them. The as far like they're a different have different jobs, the scouts and the workers and the the you know, the Warriors and whatnot and the bees of course are another animal.

He's Ant-Man like the people original Batman movie, The Batman. They call him the Ant-Man because he can shrink down to the size of an ant. So he shrinks down to the size he can control. He can actually go smaller. He can actually go inside like in the end. He can go smaller, right? I don't know. He can go smaller. I think you're thinking of the limitations. I might be thinking of the Atom actually, better guy, DC. So he gets small, but he retains his strength, his normal. No, he retains he retains the proportional strength, yeah. So he gets ant strong",

It's the opposite of proportional. No, because an ant has the it can lift like a thousand. This is what I'm saying.

Colin and I, Colin and I joke all the time, all the time the last two days in the fact that Colin and I never met about that show and never talked about it.

And he's like, and you're like, no, not really. Like, all right. And I just went to bed, yeah. And like we just got up in the morning and we did it because we've done so many we've done hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of shows together. So, yeah, it works fine. That that show is the least of my concerns. I'm not worried about that show at all, yeah. Uh, I want to make sure the qu I'm not I'm not so worried about the burnout. I think we have to just figure out the rhythm in which we we do all these shows. It's like fucking knock Portillo in his face.

Um, obviously we're going to have hiccups and misses. I mean, like we like everyone does whether you write or whether you do podcast or whatever. Um, but my biggest concern is not so much to burnout, but to make sure that people feel like they're getting quality. Um, and you know, and I'm not talking about like production value. No, I'm just talking about like is it making you laugh? Is it insightful? Whatever it is. You're we don't want to just give you an hour of dribble. It makes sense. So far, I think the fact that every show feels very different at least to me is a big deal. Right here, I'm the host. I try to drive a little bit. I try to do this.

Like so far it's been one of us sitting at the table, the other back here working, chime in, but it's also super like, okay, whatever. That's the show where like last night we we streamed our first ever Steam game, actually Verge, and fuck me if we know how to turn the sound down on a Steam game. We couldn't figure it out.

I like the it depends on what games you like because because I and I count the GameCube controller because they just re-released them, right? No, you cannot count the game. If the GameCube controller worked for Mario Kart, worked for other games, then yes, I can. F*** it's until Nintendo patches that in. No, thank you. Okay.

And when they didn't, when they showed it that way, like I can't f***ing believe that they I'm happy because I I'm used to that, but I couldn't believe that they ignored basically everyone.

It's just an ergonomic thing. I'm I'm sure Microsoft put tons of money in figuring that out. The cool thing is when I was in Japan two times ago and I talked to the the engineers behind the PS4, they said that they have a ton of prototype controllers and I'd love to see them and some of them do have offset sticks.

The light bar, you can see the evolution of the system in the controller. In other words, the light bar was supposed to be there to interact intimately with the camera, which was gonna be bundled in with the PS4. And it seems at some point that they removed it to make the cost lower. And then the light bar is a legacy of that association with the camera and it can never go away. I think that I think that future iterations of DualShock 4 in a year or two are gonna remove the light. What's wrong with the light bar? Drain your battery.
