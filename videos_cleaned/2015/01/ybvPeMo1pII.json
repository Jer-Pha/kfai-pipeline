They're still trying to figure out how they're going to distribute it. The theaters are the ones that actually decided we're going to not show it because of there's a threat and we want to be safe. We want to make sure the public the movie goer is safe. Can you imagine the lawsuits?

Walking down the street walking through Walmart with a toy gun or being a 1 year old kid playing in a playground. I do find it interesting though and this is something we've touched on is that I wasn't aware really what The Interview was until all of this came out. Uh and obviously this movie this this specific topic has wide reaching repercussions right? It's not just about the movie getting pulled. I mean there was a seriously crippling effect that it had on Sony studios. People I was reading an article saying that they had to get handwritten checks to their employees because their entire accounting system was was messed up. Wow.

Japan occupied Korea. Yeah. I mean Japan and Korea have been quarreling for a long time and obviously it really came to a head before World War II when Japan was occupying Korea for a while and really doing heinous things over there. And I think that generationally there's a lot of strife between those two countries. And for as much as we get threatened by North Korea Japan gets threatened just as much as a lot more and they can do something to them because they're right there.

So do you think a call came from the head of Sony in Japan to the head of Sony in America to look you're going to pull that movie?

Sony was going to put the film out and the theaters all the four or five of the major six or four of the major five theater chains decided against it because of the threats. Sony I still think very much wants to put this movie out especially now. They want to get the movie. They wanted the movie. This is a very expensive film. This movie would probably do better than before all the controversy because now were you going to go see the movie? No I will now though. I'll definitely see it.
