            "text": "[ Music] what's up everybody Welcome to Oreo Oration. I'm Greg and while you were out living your life, the fine people at Oreo were making endless variations to milk's favorite cookie. So every time there's a crazy flavor, I tear up in a new package and give you a tasty review without any calories. If you like that, like the video, subscribe to our Channel, share us with your friends. Can't stress how important that last part is. Today we're reviewing Red Velvet Oreo cookies. Now let you want to talk about a journey the Oreo people have taken us on ladies and gentlemen. Months ago a screenshot of this leaks. People start tweeting me, is it real? Is it real? Is it real? And I say definitively no, it is not real. Anytime here's what's wrong with the rumors about the Oreo cookies. Anytime they get started, whether it be the fried chicken Oreo, whether it be the ramen Oreo, if there's only one screenshot of the package, it's fake. Now I I think this probably leaked cuz it's the exact same mil look here it's the",

Now I I think this probably leaked cuz it's the exact same mil look here it's the exact same cream cheese flavored cream. Like this is literally the packaging they leaked with the little thing there like on the counter and that and whatever. So I get the fact that that was just probably a leak from someone inside the Oreo Corporation, some big shot in Nabisco left his iPad on a cookie Bender, everything went off the rails. Now they're real. Maybe Oreo is just testing the water, which is a brilliant thing. Leak these images then see what happens, see if people want them. I'm standing by the fact that I would love fried chicken Oreos. Sounds gross when you think about it but chicken and waffles, sweet and savory, try it. Ramen Oreos is gross, don't ever make those. So Red Velvet Oreo cookies, they're out February 2nd stores nationwide. I got the early taste . We're going to get into the review",

We're going to get into the review with the patented first look. Oh well before we get into the first look, I guess I can tell you right off the bat the first thing I noticed, smaller package. It's a it's a very concise little package here. It's not it's not the big Oreo box, it's the smaller Oreo box, which is interesting. First Look mhm mhm oh n get that bouquet going. Now my lips are touching them so that lets you know how close I have to be to smell the cream cheese part of it that cream cheese frosting which is good or bad when you think about it because I we've opened them before right and it feels like a a baker exploded in front of you. Well not a bakery, a baker exploding in front of you, much different story but you know a baker okay anyways get in there. Now they got the red velvet cookie right now. This is what's Oreo pointed this",

This is what's Oreo pointed this out of course in their literature about the the Red Velvet Oreo is the fact this is only the second time they've ever done a fancy new cookie. Of course we all know that we all know the uh the golden shortbread cookie I talk about all the time. Here we have the red velvet cookie itself. It's a it's it looks it's not like bright red right now granted I guess red velvet always is a maroon if you will and that's where we're falling right here. I think maybe it's just you know the the Kinda Funny lights here but if I was looking at it out there I don't know if I would catch the fact that it's not black. Well I guess I would see something's wrong with it. It's red for sure up close especially when they're all they're all piled together there. Uh first look impressive though the smaller package",

Uh first look impressive though the smaller package keeping all these little guys intact. Nobody's broken they're fully on they're fully packed in there. Uh I like the the the red and the white are playing playing well together. It's a pretty package. Valentine's Day ladies and gentlemen who needs flowers and chocolates anymore just toss one of these at your lover and then go to town on each other Valentine's Day. All right let's see what's happened. Uh next part of course the taste test. M mhm mother hot damn we got a winner ladies and gentlemen. Every time they do one of these these crazy flavors you're like I don't know how that's going to come out. This one tastes like a red velvet cake but it's not overpowering like you got to get into this guy. Wow the second cookie now that my mouth is no longer questioning its existence second cookie tastes",

Wow the second cookie now that my mouth is no longer questioning its existence second cookie tastes even more like red velvet cake. Uh I like it more than a regular red velvet cake piece too cuz my girlfriend loves that red velvet cake stuff and the cream cheese frosting it's too rich gets you after a while. This one feels like almost a perfect balance. I got the cream cheese and I got the super crisp super crisp cookie that's red of course doesn't matter much in my mouth right now but for history mhm I mean two in and I want to eat the whole box and again I'm stressing the fact that the aftertaste especially is very red velvet cake but not overp it's the cake part of it not just the cream cheese frosting. Nabisco like what you're doing. All right we're going to see how it pairs with milk now that's of course a big part of any Oreo do that start with the Melroy moment one two three I'm Rusty I",

It's like you know we talk about Da Vinci, Steven Tyler, Oreo Masters at work. Yeah Stephen Tyler and Oreos those are the Masters that you could think of. I'm so happy you're up against the wall from Arosi from Arosi a good cookie. Here's the weird thing about it red velvet okay it's not that weird I guess walk with me all right this going to be a walk by itself tastes like a really good piece of red velvet cake with the appropriate cream cheese frosting and cake ratio dipped into the milk it softens and you know what it tastes like Nick you know what it taste like red cake it tastes like a Hostess cupcake that's great. This is this this could EAS I guess you can't easily say that in a ad but I'm telling you one two [Music] three yeah I'm going",

Let's see how we go on the taste test oh I'm sorry the twist test. I'm overloaded with good feelings and Vibes all right so prob my [Applause] ha best two are three one perfect. I'm telling you this is we got to replace this cuz everybody it's two yeah everybody Oreo saw this show take off on the internet as it did and now they're just like making sure it happens every time got a I got a crazy ass pretty much a quadruple stuff CU remember these aren't",

So now it's time for the final score. This is one of the easiest ones I think I've ever done. This is a 9.5. The only knock I have is the double the D the you know double stuffing quadruple stuffing whatever you want to call it putting two together far too rich too much cream but other than that super crisp cookie uh tastes like red velvet cake but not an overpowering Taste of red velvet cake you dip it in milk it tastes like a Hostess cupcake I don't know what else you could ask for in a dessert I don't think this is",

So that's the way the cookie crumbles for Red Velvet Oreos but what do you think let me know in the comments your review when you get your hands on at February 2nd and then into the future and then of course while you're there in the comments let me know the Oreos we're missing here on Oreo ration yes it's hard to believe but there are cookies we still haven't reviewed tell me where you saw them what store you were in what part of the country your",
