            "text": "[ Music] Next up, the PS4 is now bundled with Last of Us, o oh, $400. I like this. Yeah, that's a very, very smart move on their part. So my question might have been, smarter to do it when you launch the game, but yeah, exactly how important is this? Do you think this will last forever? Because how some things, some sites have worded this is that this is a forever thing. Yeah, it seems like they made it, as far as when I read the blog, the PlayStation blog, it seemed like that was the status quo for now, was that the game just comes with the system. Yeah, and then the other thing is how important are game console bundles these days? They, I don't think they're that important. Back in the, back in the day, they were hugely important because games were way more expensive. So like, you know, when you bought an NES in 1986 for $200, adjusted for inflation, that's like 370, $380. And then the cartridges were 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, $80 depending on how big the game was, which is all of those would be more expensive than any game released",

And then the cartridges were 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, $80 depending on how big the game was, which is all of those would be more expensive than any game released today. So the bundle of like Mario, Duck Hunt, or Mario, Duck Hunt, Track, you know, Track Meet and all those kind of stuff later on, Mario 3, like those mattered because it saved people real money. Yeah. Um, and I'm not saying $60 say is not real money, but I'm saying like it was a little more, uh, it was a little crazier back then. Uh, cartridges were really expensive. I think that the further you get along, uh, bundled , bundles became less and less important. Super Nintendo bundles were important. Sonic, Sonic with Genesis is arguably the most important, uh, bundle ever released, um, in the sense of that, you know, gen, everyone forgets Genesis came out in'89, uh, two years before SNES came out, came with Alter ed Beast, which is arguably one of the worst games of all time. And, uh, that game sucks, that game sucks from, uh,",

That game's like literally a one, you know, like, and, uh, and it, SNS came out and Genesis was going to lose and Sonic turned their fortunes around bundling that in. It almost act that they just tend like the console never existed. Yeah, it was a relaunch, it was brand new. Yeah. And so that was a really important thing, but it's time and then, you know, Mario with N64 and , but today it's like, no, I don't really think it matters. The thing nowadays is that there's so many bundles, you know what I mean? They come along so, and we're coming off this thing right now. You have the Destiny PS4 Bundle and you had another one, what was, you were, there was a buy one get one at during Christmas in the holidays. I think it's important right now in terms of",

I think it's important right now in terms of people who have been on the fence, here's this game that's a perfect 10, it's a game of the year, arguably a masterpiece, you know, everybody loves this game and now it's in there. So if you were waiting, you're like, ah, $400 seems a lot for just a system and I'm not interested in Destiny, now that it's packed in, right? It's like, well, all right, because I remember like, I forget what it was, what console it was where I was buying it, my mom was like, there's no, they don't, there's no game in this, you know what I mean? Like that is a to a non-gamer, somebody who just like knows a little bit about video games, it is an interesting proposition. It is more value arguably than what you getting. No, definitely, I think there's a lot of value there, but I think that the exciting thing about The Last of Us coming with",

The Last of Us is arguably the best PlayStation exclusive of all time. It's arguably the best PS3 game, best PS4 game, Naughty Dog's best game. It's like, it's like, it's, it's a lot of bests and it's the best bundled in regular bundled in game, not like a special kind of offer or whatever since maybe like Super Mario World, you know. So like it's like that's pretty significant. I think it's going to have people in the door. The cooler thing for Sony is that from a business standpoint makes a lot of sense because it's a first-party game. They don't have to pay licensing fees. They don't owe anything to Naughty Dog to put it in the box. They're going to get more copies out there which will inflate their sales numbers. So there's like a lot of reasons for them to do it as well. It's",

So there's like a lot of reasons for them to do it as well. It's not like it's, uh, they're bundling in Battlefield or something and then they have to split the money with Dice and EA. It's basically just, it's not free money, they just don't have, it's there's no, there's a negligent cost and they're just proliferating number booster exactly. In with 18 and a half million PS4s out there, probably more like 19 million now, uh, they're just trying to saturate the market and they're doing a really nice job. I mean the market saturation 14 months in is just as good as it was with Wii 14 months in, although Wii was heavily supply constrainted. So, uh, it's a, it's a nice move, it's a good move, it's a logical move and I wouldn't expect that it's going to be the last time Sony does this. It's just 2015 looks a little barren right now for exclusives for Sony. I think a lot of",

I don't think Guerrilla's ready with their new game. Obviously they're going to probably make a new Killzone. PFF is not ready. So, you know, we have The Order, we have Bloodborne, which both come from second party Studios that are exclusive and the only first party exclusive that we know about that's coming out in 2015 is Uncharted, which Greg and I don't, you know, especially Greg doesn't think it's even going to come out in 2015. So this is a nice way to say like, well, here's a game. Yeah, and, uh, you know, relax and enjoy yourself and get online and spend some time with it.

One that Prov F, that's the one that I always talk about, right? That's I bought you might Wii for the Virtual Console and for Zelda and for, you know, the laundry list of other games and when I brought it home and that's what my mom wanted to play, that's what we all played it this cool thing make this character and then when she found out that's bundled with the system, right?

Yeah, they essentially were buying that the Wii Sports Machine, it was one toy. Yeah, it was the Wii Sports toy. Yeah, my first bundle was my first console ever which was the Super Nintendo that came with Mario All-Stars Plus World, which my favorite cart of all time. If you if I had to choose my favorite video game and it had to be one physical thing, it would be that because you get Mario one, Mario 2, Mario 2 America, Mario 3, Mario 2 America and Mario World. Well, Mario 2, our Mario 2 is called Mario USA in Japan, uh, but it's yeah, five great games. Well, at Lost Levels isn't, I don't know if it's a great game, it it's a good game.

So it's it's um, you know, kind of tricky in that sense, but yeah, that was The Proving Ground at the same time it was the reason why people bought the console and the attach rate ended up being abysmal and stuff like that. So it was kind of a blessing and a curse, but I think it's a blessing for Nintendo in terms of their bank account because they have like what 1 5 billion plus dollars in cash on hand from the success of the Wii end the DS. Um, yeah, it's a nice point. That's a nice point.

I don't know, maybe I feel like everyone's played the, yeah, but there's people on the fence for sure who are waiting or not, right? You know what I mean? Like that didn't know what they were getting into, they didn't want to jump into, they they're waiting to see how it all pans out not to know that you get this amazing game right off the bat, I think it helps.

My friend hit me up the other day and he's like my son is seven years old is getting into video games what console would you recommend and I was like well and I went through all of them like I guess the Wii U honestly because like they have two kids who are younger and or three actually now that are all going to come up and want to play stuff too and it's the multiplayer machine and it's cuty for everybody and this that and the other it's good and he's like huh oh and it's good yeah yeah I'm not I'm not saying all that you know but I mean the fact that Mario appeals to all ages right whereas I'm like there's good games here and there's multiplayer stuff on PS4 but I'm thinking it's TowerFall Ascension and",
