You guys are the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty, Greg Miller. Hey, we just saw a lot of cool shit. We did not see Crash Bandicoot, shocking, can't believe that. But we did see a lot of other cool shit. Let's go through this real quick. Okay, it all started off with a little thing called The Last Guardian. Yeah, Colin was right. Colin was right. Colin was wrong though about the release date. I was 2016. Yeah, I'm surprised. Well, we'll get into, we'll get into, we will. Just running through this, then new Guerrilla franchise, Horizon Zero Dawn. Then we saw a little Hitman teaser, announcement of an exclusive Beta. Street Fighter V new character, Birdie, Cammy's coming back, beta July 3rd. Then we saw a little, little actual gameplay tease of No Man's Sky. Lot to say about that when we get there. Release date soon. Media Molecule came",

But continue. But yeah, we'll get there. Firewatch came out. They did their thing. Game looks awesome. Destiny new expansion, September 15th, 2015, The Taken King. Assassin's Creed Syndicate came out, another trailer, no other stuff like that. Then they made some Square announcements. The biggest news of all, World of Final Fantasy. It's this really cute little thing where there's like these cute Final Fantasy characters. And then they came out, they're like, \"Oh, this other thing's happening too. It's a remake of Final Fantasy VII.\" And I guess some people were excited. Yeah, but I was shit excited. Holy shit, it happened, guys. It shit happened. We'll get back to that.",

This is the craziest press conference. I can't believe we're going to get to it eventually. $538,000, $540. So this Kickstarted for $1 million. They're, they're, they're getting, get there. Then we got a little Batman: Arkham Knight Scarecrow missions, exclusive PS4. I like that they totally spoiled the end of Arkham City if you hadn't beaten you. Then they went into the Morpheus talk. Now you guys were, won that one pretty easily. Yeah, exact. I mean, I just keep going. We'll come back to all this shit. But I mean, there's some shit crazy ass crap here.

You can get all the cart channels. It's, you just buy channels without the bundle. We'll see how that works, 'cause if Apple couldn't figure it out, I'm not so convinced that Play, you think PlayStation Vue is going to be, wants to do it. Then pretty big deal, Call of Duty. First one, Sony thing. Then they, they said that the, the new home of Call of Duty is now PlayStation. So shots fired. Then Star Wars music started playing and it was a cheap pop and everyone got excited. But it was for Disney Infinity 3.0, which is cool. And they, they showed a bunch of stuff. So there's your kid Star Wars game, Colin. It's Infinity, which is there, you know, it's what they're doing. There's all the toys.",

Then they showed some more Battlefront. And my God, that was salivating. It looks, it looks amazing. It looks like a movie. Doesn't make sense. Then they ended with Uncharted 4, which made sense. And it started, the demo started and then it crashed. I just want to put that out there. Yeah, is that a hint? Is that a hint? No, it's not a hint. It's a hint that it's really a real demo. I'm see, I saw Naughty Dog and then it crashed. Naughty Dog crashed. Oh my God, you're right. It turns out all lead up to the Bandicoot, or what is it? Crash Bandicoot, Crash finally making his appearance. So we starting at the top or where we starting from? Let's start at, let's start at the top. I, I have notes here.

And I like that they just got it right out of the way. I think it makes perfect sense. They've made us wait long enough for that game. Like you want to talk about the cheers Shawn Layden got right to come out there and say that this, like as soon as he started into, \"This is something people have been waiting for,\" this is the place started going nuts because everyone knew what came next. And to come out there and have you wait, his name pop up, you know what I mean? Have it will go to, have it look like the old game.

But I think we were talking about like a dramatic ground up difference where it wouldn't be the same dog, it wouldn't be the same guy, it wouldn't be the same bird dog, cat dog. I think that's important too because, you know, we were expecting uh something radically different in the fact that they gave us exactly the game that we've been waiting for. Like this looks like very similar demo to the one that we saw a long time ago. And like some people can complain about that, but I think that's, that's silly. It's like it, this is what we were waiting for. This is what we want. If we were to see something totally new, it'd be a different game, you know?

I and lead with it to get that pop, to get everybody going to be like, \"We're finally shit giving you that.\" You'd think that would be like the high point. But then the, a lot more kept coming. Yeah. Uh, the big, I mean, The Last Guardian, there was two things that surprised me. My assumption was that when they were ready to show The Last Guardian again, that it would be close to when it was going to launch. And my, and because that just makes sense.

Me personally, I wouldn't have just show, wouldn't have shown it at all, um, if it was going to be that far out. The big thing that I thought was very interesting about uh the conference was that they specifically called out Fumito Ueda in the intro of the, of it. And then they actually went to him, showed him in the crowd. And that is a big deal and that is a big sign. Um, because there was a lot of, a lot of drama coming out of Japan and a lot of rumors coming out of Japan that you had a massive falling out with Sony. Yep. Um, and I think that that might have still been the case. And clearly he was like, you know, the word was that the producer and the director quit Ueda.",

There was bigger rumors that they were fired, um, and then brought back as, as consultants, basically being, you know, kind of like as a punishment. Who the hell really knows what happens? But that showed to me like for, for Shuhei Yoshida and Japan Studio to say like, \"Everything's cool with us.\" And um, he's still working on the game. And the visionary, the man who you think is making the game is, is making the game. Because a lot of the rumors recently were Mark Cerny. And we've heard this from many people that Mark Cerny is really the one finishing the game now. Um, who of course is responsible for games like Crash Bandicoot.

It was also big that Ueda was in the crowd, went to him and they talked to him for, or they, you know, talked about him for a minute. I love that on your notes it just says, \"Wow,\" next to it. There's a little bracket, \"Wow.\" This, this conference had a couple of moments that reminded me a lot of the PlayStation Experience panel when they showed Uncharted 4 the first time. And Colin kept going, \"You shit seeing this?\" And elbowed me the ribs. But you were, you were off-kilter. So you just kept turning around and saying things to me instead of physically poking me.

A couple of them were Final Fantasy. But to finally have this game, this game that only Ryan Clements had seen in motion at the NGP reveal event, you know what I mean? When they announced that hardware. To finally have it up on there, to see Shu come out beaming and be able to say, \"Hey, it's actually happening. It's coming. I'm so, you know, glad to be able to tell you about it.\" It's crazy. Yeah, I think, you know, and we'll get more into the games or whatever. But like the first 45 minutes or so, the way they were rolling out these games and the way they were rolling out their exclusives, I tweeted out. I was like, \"Man, Sony's kicking the shit out of Microsoft.\" And and I, that's a great thing. Yeah. And I, and I, I said",

The unfortunate thing for Sony, and we'll get into it when we get into the games, is that they, someone tweeted at me or said in the comments, I don't remember where I saw it, but they were right where they were saying they really created this huge wave in the beginning, then were able to ride it. And when you really look at the conference in three brackets, like beginning, middle, end, 30 minutes, 30 minutes, and 30 minutes. First 30 minutes was extraordinary. This first half of the second 30 minutes was really good. And then it's slowed down. And then it got better obviously with Uncharted. So I was definitely premature on that.

Yeah, that's, I'd rather get through this and then actually have a talk about it. Okay, so next up is Horizon. Um, this was that shit demo was awesome. The game looks extraordinary. I said it looks like Ygritte from Game of Thrones if she was, you know, in a, in a future world. You get to play as her and she's a shit badass. I love that. Just the little bit of the snippet of the story they gave us was super exciting too, right? It isn't some alien planet. It looks like it's our planet. And, you know, we've gone away.

Like that was, and it's, it's bright, colorful, totally different than the Killzone. Yeah, that sold me, man. It totally sold me. I'm going to play that game for sure. Yeah, it's cool to see, you know, it's cool to see Guerrilla's leadership kind of come on stage and admit that they've done nothing but play, make Killzone games for 10 years.

Um, but it's cool for them to be like, you know, we, we are known for Kill, you know, and he didn't say it implicit, but like, you know, we're known for something and and we're doing something else, right? Um, and this is clearly the game they were talking about at GDC all those years ago. Um, and I like how, and I like what's funny is that there's a connection between, I don't think you heard what I was saying to you about it, but there's a, there's a connection between Killzone and Horizon, I think. And I don't think it's implicit like this is Helghan or something or you. But um, or Vector or whatever.

I'm not saying that it's like they were orange. I'm not saying that at least they looked orange to me. And I'm not saying that there's an implicit connection, but I was like, there's stylistic choices that are being made in Guerrilla Games, um, that seem like it's familiar. It's grounded and it makes sense. Um, but you know, it's a familiar game. You can look at it and be like, it's a Guerrilla. I want to know more about it. Of course, I want to know more about it. Of course. So then they come out with Hitman. Uh, yeah, Hitman. I mean, I don't, I don't, I'm personally not a fan of what IO Interactive has been doing with Hitman for a long time.

Unless, you know, and people get nerdy about BlazBlue. And I don't want to disrespect those people that play those games. But Street Fighter V is a big deal.

But I don't know. Yeah, I, I, I'm excited about everything that the way it sounds. And and the fact that there's just seemingly infinite amount of stars.

And then it did create things on. So, but I get that. But I've seen that. Stop showing me the same kind of things. But I think they're showing, they showed typically more canned things. I'm saying that this at least was a more organic thing. I'm not defending it because I, I've always wondered about the gameplay. Yeah, the gameplay. And about Hello Games is a small studio.

Because this is the thing that the chat was talking about on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames, right? All these great games are getting announced, all these cool exclusives, and none of them are for this year. You know, we've had this conversation a few times on the Gamescast and on Colin & Greg Live right here on Twitch. The fact that Sony has, it seems to be already a vacant holiday. You know what I mean? What is the big PlayStation game? Sorry. Yeah, no. And I'm surprised they didn't even mention Uncharted Collection. Yeah, I know. Yeah, it came up in the one sizzle reel. It just popped up at the bottom there. Yeah, it's like, like I'm surprised they didn't talk about it. Or I'm surprised I don't like how, how they just bury Naughty Dog",

I like that they come like a game obviously know needs no introduction. Yeah, of course it doesn't. But come out afterwards and say something about it. I was a little disappointed in that. I actually didn't watch the, that much of the, of the Uncharted thing because I don't really want to see any more of it. Like there's just, I just, I'm kind of like, all right, I know when we get, I have plenty to say when we get there too. Um, but yeah, we'll talk more about that. Up next on the rundown to Firewatch. Or actually, it might have been Dreams. I think I, my apologies, my apologies. Dreams came next. The new Media Molecule game.

Yeah, like this is definitely an iteration on that idea. Yeah, there's no doubt about it. Yeah, just the way the game, well, if you go back and look at, I can just see it in my mind's eye, but if people want to go back and look at the reveal for PS4 and what they were doing with the rock, like the rock band and stuff like that, like it's just a very similar idea, the way they paint them, the way they like, they're looking, stretching, Mission stuff and all that. And they they admitted that the game has been in development for four years. So the game, the game has been going for a while and I assume will, you know, come out next year, whatever.

Um and I believe that they can do it because I think that if you even look at something like a Quantic Dream game, it's like, what the hell is this? Yeah, you know what I mean? Like you have to figure out a way to communicate what it is, but the the thing that concerns me about Media Molecule, they're just getting weirder and weirder and there's nothing, there's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but as they get weirder, the game stops being a game.

And and the thing is that LittleBigPlanet was massively popular because it was a cohesive and coherent game that you can understand. Yep. Tearaway was like something more experimental on Vita and it was stranded there. That's why they're bringing it to PS4 so they can sell more copies of it obviously and show more people. But again, it was more abstract and less a game. And now you're getting something that's really **** abstract, but I believe that there's something there. No, I mean, those guys are super talented, but the problem is that I think we can sit there and uh that game company can put out these games that we can point to and say this is Art and it doesn't matter that it didn't sell a million copies, but if Media Molecule puts out this game and it is",

Games are art and artists should be allowed to go create and stuff, but then there's scale and there's companies and there's Publishers and there's demands, right? And where does that all fall? And that's when you start worrying about what is happening. You know, they hit, they hit with LittleBigPlanet and they hit with a mascot for PlayStation that they could market toys and they could do this and they could do that and they kind of, I think, got a lot of rope then, right? Like you're, you guys are the quirky Europeans, go do whatever you need to do. And then now we got this guy drawn Play-Doh noses and legs out there.

Like I, that that maybe you'll show it to me and make it cool, but like, first impression, I'm like, very artsy, very interesting, not something I feel like playing. And again, it's one of those questions of who is the audience for this game, right? Right, right, right. Like that's, it's obviously the people that love just creating things and just kind of seeing that, but it's like, what are you creating, you know? Yeah, yeah, 100%. I 100% agree with you. All right, so then we go into Firewatch. Yes, Firewatch. I was already sold on it. It was great to see more of it. It was great to see it up on the big screen, get some time, you know what I mean?

Does that matter? Alfredo says good. Yeah, unfortunately for Sony, a lot of this leaked already, so I like, I, you know, that's that's, well, it's more unfortunate for Activision maybe, but um I don't care, but it's it's Destiny significant.

I think this is something that they know they have to do and they're paying for someone to do it. I think that trailer was such a cool way to do it too. Like it was such a, it wasn't what I would expect from it. Like you, they could have done so much simpler things. Like they could have just again re-updated the the intro that they did for the PS3 when they they first showed that tech demo. They could have just done that again, you know?

I I actually don't envy the team that's going to remake it. It's going to be very, very difficult. Obviously, the game's going to look great and stuff like that, but there's something sacred about to try to capture everything. You're going to be noted to death on every change you make. Yeah, and it's also very key to point out, not exclusive to the PlayStation 4. No, it just comes to PlayStation first, which I'm happy about. But man, Final Fantasy VII on Xbox.

Don't **** invest in it. Don't do this. How are if you can't show a press conference, you can't show in a commercial and nobody gives a ****, you're not going to sell these things. Yeah, I mean, I'm not I'm not in disagreement with you in the sense that I think Morpheus is doomed, but I don't know. I don't know what they're thinking with it. I unless they're unless their whole game plan is like, we're not",
