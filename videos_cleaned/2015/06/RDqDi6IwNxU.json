And at MomoCon this time around, we got to hang out with a gentleman we all know and love named Mega Ran. And Mega Ran is one of the nicest human beings I continue to come in contact with. He keeps coming into our world and he, of course, is a big time rapper on the internet. You can find him, he sells out shows all the time, played a bunch at MomoCon . I made it to one of them which is really cool. I've been a Mega Ran fan for many a years. You're one of the people who freaked out when he reached out to us about coming on the shows. He has a song called \"Grow Up\" which I highly recommend because it's really, really awesome. And I never in my life thought I'd see that song live and I did and it was, it was a weird moment. I called my brother and I was like, \"Listen to this.\" He was like, \"Is that fucking Mega Ran?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, it's fucking Mega Ran.\" Yeah, it was good. That's a good moment.

But Mega Ran is like I said, super successful. So the fact that that he came here and played on Kinda Funny Live the one time was amazing. The fact that he , I I said, \"Oh, you're going to MomoCon? We're there too. You should come to the Kinda Funny Greg Live show.\" He came to the Kinda Funny Live show. Uh then I was, he's texting me, he's like, \"Hey, what are you guys doing for dinner?\" I'm like, \"Oh, we have a meet and greet tonight. You should come.\" He's like, \"Okay.\" Came, stayed the whole time, took photos and stuff. And he just radiates awesomeness. You just want to hug him. You just want to talk to him. He's one of those guys who's always happy it seems.

I'm starting with Mega Ran. I mean, MomoCon in general, I think nice people was like a overwhelming thing that just kept happening. Yeah, like down in Atlanta, people were very nice. Yes, it was like kind of weird. Oh, shg Parton our progress. Yeah, I think that especially like we talk a lot about Comic-Con, E3, those are we see the industry side of that, right? But you have to understand if you're going to be around us, a group of people who are into that specific subject like matter, basically nerd, quote unquote, nerd culture, even though I don't necessarily like agree or like that term, um just because like spoilers, nerd culture is mainstream culture now.

So like, if you think that and and to each's own, if you if you take pride in being called a nerd or or liking to sort of disassociate yourself from mainstream culture in that regard, more power to you. But we live in a time right now where we need to stop pretending that comic books and video games are for or quote unquote nerds. Everyone plays video games now to some degree and everyone loves comic book movies to some degree. I'm over generalizing , but that's way more mainstream than than it has ever been in the past and it's just going to continue to keep going. I don't know why the hell I started talking about that. Oh, because when you go to these conferences, you meet these people, especially MomoCon, where it is not an industry show, it is just a for shits and giggles show. Like you're going to go, it's",

Like you're going to go, it's just it's just to to celebrate the culture and you meet people that like hold the door open for you or other people you know or like I was telling Tim, like the interactions in the elevators are hilarious because you're sitting there and people will come in and there's that awkward moment of you like that you can tell the person wants to compliment the other person on their cosplay, but they don't want to do it in such a way that kind of makes them look like they're not cool, you know? So they have that kind of like, \"Hey, you know, like, you know,\" they kind of point at each other like, \"You're so and so. Oh, you're so and so. Awesome, awesome.\" And then one of them leaves and the other person is like, \"I just met someone that was in the same thing I'm mad.\" It's fun. Um so you get these really, really nice people",

Um so you get these really, really nice people at these things in a long story short and you get it's fun to be around that sort of positive energy because unlike E3 which sucks your soul, um not true and is is by day four everyone just wants to, I mean, basically E3 is is like Thunderdome. Everyone just wants to kill each other after the third day. You call everything Thunderdome. I well, I don't I'm not really sure I know what that term means. Um so that that is fun. It is fun being around MomoCon. I look and same with PAX, right? When we went to PAX East, I was just like, \"Wow, man, it was really nice and cool.\" Yeah, and like even and they're respectful even when they come up to like say what's up to you. They're always, you know, everyone's always respectful of each other's time. It's a it's it's nice. I like our lives. It's good. Um I don't know who else",

Those are good people to know. Yeah, and it's like she is the type of person that doesn't necessarily like keep up with my crazy life and all that crazy shit. But it's like every once in a while she'll just reach out randomly and just be like, \"Hey, I'm proud of you.\" And it's like that's so unnecessary, but it means so much to me.

Um like when I go out and about, like when I'm interacting with people, you're super nice to people who don't live with you. Yeah, exactly. I hate Greg, but those homeless people you kill. Yeah, and and I mean, there's things we're not going to talk about on the show. Okay, sorry, I apologize. But like my my basic interaction is like when I walk, I'm actually quite friendly. Um in my day-to-day life, in terms if I go to a bar or I go to a, you know, I'm I'm checking out the grocery store.

But I was on the subway uh in New York City like a year ago and I I let some like some like gentleman kind of got in front of me and I was like , \"Oh, go ahead.\" And then he just walked past me like, \"Oh, you're welcome.\" And he's like, \"What do you want, a medal?\" You know?

I'm like, \"Are you fucking kidding me, you old man?\" And then the second time was like like the second time like in the food court, some guy like dropped his phone, the battery like flew across the and I was like, and he didn't notice me, was having a conversation.

He didn't do that. He just kind of looked at you and just gave, yeah.

So I encounter nice people every day, but I also encounter people that are not very nice every day. The one thing I noticed is that um and I think it's just the nature of Kinda Funny's audience and the audience we've engendered and how we've kind of just fly pushed out people that are not friendly and not nice is that we just have a very nice audience. Audience great. Very, very like when we meet them, we meet them . We met hundreds of them this weekend, MomoCon in Atlanta at the meet and greet and and at the panels and our our signing sessions and stuff.

She was dealing with a foreign guy and there's nothing against foreigners, but I don't think he quite understood how grocery stores were supposed to work here. Either that or couldn't get his card to work. Something was not happening properly where she was trying to explain it to him how to like run his card through the thing and he was just like, \"Oh, he's used to tapping it with the chip.\" I don't know what the hell it was.
