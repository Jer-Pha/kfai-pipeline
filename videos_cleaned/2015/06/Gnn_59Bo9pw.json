Okay, today we're talking about something very near and dear to both of our hearts , trees, older women. Oh yeah, that's, that's good, that's better. Our question comes from a boy named Daniel. Oh, hi Daniel. He says, hey Tim and Nick, it's great that you guys are doing this show. My name is Daniel. I'm an 18-year-old M. Right now I'm in the first year of film school. Oh, good, good for you, Daniel. And there's this girl at my college studying another career that I really like. I've known about her because I have friends in common with her. I'm currently talking to her for help on the end of my semester film project because I, because I need someone who does really good makeup, but haven't really got to talk to her casually yet. Okay, she likes video games, anime, and your typical nerd stuff and she's great at drawing. She also does cosplay . It's kind of like Ramona from Scott",

It's kind of like Ramona from Scott Pilgrim. She dyes her hair every couple of weeks. I know this cuz I kind of stalk her on Instagram from time to time. Happens PR. Yeah, the thing is that don't go back and like all our photos from like a year ago. That's bad luck creepy, always a bad luck creepy. The thing is that she is 1 year and 7 months older than me, which means she'll be 20 this year and I'm 18. Also, she just broke up with her boyfriend. So my question is, is there anything wrong with trying something out with an older girl and how do you approach a girl who's older than you? Thank you guys and keep being amazing. Now I know that seems like when you're 19 or 18 that seems like there's a wide margin, which it is when you're 19 or 18, it seems like it's a 10 year gap , a freshman in high college before between like a senior Junior in",

That's, I don't know, I don't know about that. I feel like 18 is when you finally hit that that point of years don't matter that much because you're out of high school and you're in college with people that the older you get the less and less that matters. Like my wife is a year older than I am and it doesn't matter anymore. Once you hit 30 is when it really stops mattering that that's when it just kind of opens up and you're like, I date a 75y old right now, no problem. No fation 75. No, I'm into that. Um Daniel, the the gist of it is this, she's not that much older than you, so I would give you the same advice I would give you if you were trying to date someone younger, not much younger than you though because you're 18, so that's kind of a threshold unfortunately. Um but if you're dating someone",

Um but if you're dating someone your same age, I give you the same advice, be yourself, be bold, go out, talk to her. Yeah, for sure and you're already talking to her. You have excuses to talk. You guys are working on some movies together and stuff. That's great. The fact that you're both in college, she's not looking at you as your younger person. Like when you're in middle school and the girls in high school, even if you're in high, if you're in high school and they're in college, forget about it, you're done, it ain't going to happen. But if you're both in college, you're set, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Yeah, and overall though, the idea of older women, like not even just the this scenario cuz this scenario isn't so much an older woman scenario. I tell you an older woman scenario is when I was 23 dating a 33-year-old, right? That's when",

I tell you an older woman scenario is when I was 23 dating a 33-year-old, right? That's when you learn a lot about life, your body and how flexible you can be. Yeah, but in this case , I think that you guys probably have a lot more in common than you think you do. Uh you seem like you're in similar Fields. I say I say go for it man, just go up talk to her, invite her to be a part of your project. That's a great way to indoctr inate her into your life because you're passionate about something and women like guys that are passionate and ambitious about things. So I would say uh I would say go for it. Yeah, definitely go for it. I mean that's a good advice always though, just be confident and go for it. Be confident . There's one thing that women love is confidence. If you go up like you like you belong there, like you deserve to be there and you deserve to be talking to her, she will respond to that and",
