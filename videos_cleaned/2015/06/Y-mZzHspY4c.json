There's a thread right at the top there for your Gamescast topics. There's a whole bunch of them. Shout out to Lind ay, who's one of the superstars on the forums. Yeah, she spells her name with an A, it's Linday, L-I-N-D-A-Y. But she's **** awesome and she like has been super great in the forums making sure everything is beautiful and organized. Um, and she organized this topic very nicely for me. Shawn1Neo says, \"Hi, guys, can I ask your opinion on the lack of light gun shooters for consoles and what the future holds?\" Oh, yeah, this guy talked to me on Twitter about this. Yeah, here's another sub-genre we don't talk about. Yeah, I mean, peripheral games are just are just largely dead and that's the problem. It's peripherals. Like, that's why we don't see them. People got burned out with Guitar Hero and all that. And I think, you know, the PS1 era light gun games were",

And, um, I go further back than that, like the Genesis Sharpshooter and SNES. Well, SNES's was a failure, but obviously the the Super Scope was was no one gave a **** about that thing. I think it was awesome because they used to play outside with it and like, but, uh, some some reason I had that what just having listening to you. But yeah, light light gun light guns were like in the Duck Hunt era. A light gun was a gimmick, right? It was a way to like, well, I'm playing like I don't I still don't this isn't a video game, it's a toy, it's an entertainment system. It does so many so much more than games.

You know, that's such an important memory for a lot of people. And, um, I just think it doesn't have the same those games don't have as much depth as a lot of things. Exactly, that's the big thing.

I think think for me the first thing that comes to mind would be the later Metal Gear games. Oh, ****, good one. That's just because I want the Metal Gear Solid theme song. Yeah, um, that question is too hard. I don't have an answer for it. The the other thing would be I feel like a lot of this isn't answering your question, but it's the idea.

But that doesn't count'cause it's not a game soundtrack and the soundtrack to Super Mario World's awesome.

I'll give a shout out here to and you're going to laugh, but stick with me, the Injustice comic book,'cause that was better than the story of the game and that went on way longer.

Yeah, they're usually a little more competitive like TowerFall and stuff like that. But there actually there was a fair amount of co-op ones. There's like, you know, all the like the Rayman games and the Left 4 Dead, New Super Mario Bros., Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty extraction. Yeah, there's a fair amount.

It's Unreal Engine 5 or whatever the new Unreal Engine is where people rendered like apartments that indistinguishable from from fake things. Like they were totally indistinguishable. Like you could show that picture to someone, be like, \"This is my apartment,\" and they'd be like, \"Oh, it's beautiful.\" Yeah, so like if they can do that with environments, obviously doing that with a person is going to be harder. But see, but that's my thing though, is you can show them a picture, but if you showed them that video, like I remember the video talking about it was mind-blowing, but the video, you know, is not real though. It's not so much the animation as much as it's the sheen things have and I don't think that you can get rid of that. You will though. That's the whole thing is like I'm with you right now for the where we are right now in the next five years is not going to happen, right? But I think beyond that moving forward, yeah, it's totally going to",

But I think beyond that moving forward, yeah, it's totally going to happen because they'll solve those problems, you know what I mean? Like the day they figure out how to **** animate a pillow in covers, that's the one, right? And that was like one of the things I ever pulled away from whatever GDC talk I was at, right? Is that if you'll notice, watch people get into bed, they never cover themselves with a blanket and the the pillow never reacts because those are the hardest things to animate. They just can't make it look real, so they don't do it. Yeah, but see, I think you guys are even taking this even further than I am with animation and stuff'cause that's a whole other layer that will they nail that? Yeah, probably. Like that's so you're just talking about in-game. I'm talking about the look of it . Like'cause even take video games out of just CG in general, like in movies, like they",

Like'cause even take video games out of just CG in general, like in movies, like they still haven't figured it out. Like it's still but it's close all the time. It's it's close, but it's like it's it is close, but I don't think there's ever been an example of it being that close where you're like, oh, we're going to get there where it is indistinguishable. Maybe for the seconds, maybe for whatever, but it's like as an overall experience, I don't think we're ever going to get a video game that you can't tell the difference. And it it has to do with so much different things. The animation in addition to the look and the sheen and the colors and reflection, all that stuff. In addition to what's in focus, like we were talking about some game or graphic show today. It's like if I'm looking at you right now, how do you replicate what's going on to all my sides, right?

I don't think we'll ever they'll ever figure that out. And especially when you're playing a game, replicating that isn't a video game then then it's a weird simulator, you know what I mean? It's like video games need a little bit more. So I don't know. It's we'll see, but I I doubt it. In 50 years from now. Mhm. You and I will be in the nursing home together. Yeah, your girlfriend will be dead. Yeah, my girlfriend will be dead. We'll be chilling there and I'm going to poke you in the ribs and show you something and I'm going to show you the new shirt.

Thank you so much, Greg. Thank you, Kevin, for being here on your birthday wearing your little skinny shirt. I'm happy about this. Kevin lost a lot of weight. At the very beginning of the show, I took a photo and her to go what it was was that Kevin had one of his buttons had come undone, so I had just **** right on to the belly button. I need to capture that moment. So that's what I did there. I don't need to see it again. I have it. It's okay. God, we're talking about black holes earlier. Gargantua. There you go.",
