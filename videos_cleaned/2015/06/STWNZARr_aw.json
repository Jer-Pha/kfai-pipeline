I'm utterly in love with the song and you can D it free at bit.ly/KFthemes. In addition to that, Tonedeff went all out and put together the Kinda Funny Theme Pack Volume One, collecting all the beats he produced that we use as theme songs to Greggy's Show,'Calling Greg Live,''Love and Sex Stuff,''Conversation with Colin,''Fall the Leader,'and more, as well as the original rap versions of all those songs. Please go support him, go listen to all of his amazing music, and tweet at Tonedeff letting him know what you think. He's done a lot for Kinda Funny and loves you guys just as much as we do, so go show him some of that Kinda Funny family love. Peace.",
