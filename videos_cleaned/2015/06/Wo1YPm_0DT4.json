Thank you for having me. Thank you for coming. Get up on that microphone. Don't be afraid. Yeah, you can scoot your chair. There you go. Get all into it. So, weeks ago, you and I went to LA. We did, got to play Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain for days back to back. Yeah, what did you think? I'm a big Metal Gear fan, so I was really excited going into it. Uh, was not disappointed. Yes, I'll be, I'm going to say it right now, and then I'll put all the caveats at the end. Game of the year so far, in parenthesis, so far, right? But because my game of the year list so far is like Witcher 3, and then now that Metal Gear's here, it's like better now. Where does Batman fall into that conversation? Where does Fallout fall in? I don't know. It all depends if they have horses, I think. Exactly. Well, that's the thing right now, playing The Witcher",

Well, that's the thing right now, playing The Witcher is I'm riding around in this horse and I'm like, this is good. But Metal Gear's horse is so much better. Snake's horse is so much better. It's smarter. It gets to you quicker when you call it in. But there's a lot to talk about for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Uh, we have a whole bunch of regulations from Konami. They don't, they don't want us spoiling the game for you, so you'll see me check this every so often to make sure I don't go off book. No plot elements, nothing like that. That's fine, whatever. Um, I was, I mean, like, this is my notebook from the event. I, it'll one day be on eBay. And if you look at it, the first note I ever made, it's Mother **** Peace Walker. This, this game is everything. I, everyone knows I'm, I'm Kinda Funny that I'm a huge Peace Walker fan, right? Did you love Peace Walker?",

And then when it came out for the HD Collection, I was too busy and missed it. Yeah, there's a million other things going on. But for me, sitting down to play this thing, like the presentation, the way they get into it, the way it's structured in terms of like, all right, we're going to go on these, you know, your Side Ops are over here, your main missions are over here. But then you start getting the base and building it out, you know, and now you need this R&D wing, and you get all these different materials. You go, I'm like, this is HD Peace Walker.

I was like, I, I'm obsessed right now thinking about it and getting that game again and just like the time I'm going to put into it, you know? Yeah, and it's interesting if you think about the amount of time that Kojima's put into it, because Peace Walker was initially supposed to be Metal Gear Solid V, right? So it's not strange to see all these influences take place. But the game is gigantic. It's massive. And you have so much to play with using the mechanics that you were just talking about. I don't know if I'm ever going to finish that game, if I'm honest. See, my, my concern is that I'm going to, I'm going to lose myself to it, 'cause this is like literally, it feels like the version of Metal Gear I've been waiting for my entire life, because it's my favorite franchise.

Metal Gear Solid, the original on PlayStation One, was my favorite game for a long time until I finally gave in. I was like, Peace Walker is my favorite game now. But to get it here where it's like, it has the trophies, it has the Platinum from the jump, it's beautiful, the gameplay is solid, and there's so many reasons to replay it. And it was interesting coming in, the when Ground Zeroes had hit, I had taken a day off work and I'm like, I'm going to sit here and get 100% in this game and I'm to just destroy it. And I jumped in and it didn't never felt right to me. I felt like I was getting captured too easily. I was getting spotted. I wasn't having fun with it. And so that turned me off and I dropped away from it. I mean, I beat it, but I never went back for the 100%. And going into this, I was concerned if I was going to feel that way about Phantom Pain.",

Where it's like, it would be like, you know, it felt like in Ground Zeroes, somebody would see me and we'd get that like slow motion thing and I wouldn't be able to shoot him in time or I'd get caught on the way out. This one, it seemed like I was able to use that to my advantage, actually get away, hide, get in a cardboard box, get into a dumpster, do all these different things to get away from the people who are coming at me.

But Ground Zeroes didn't really have that aspect to it. It was more of an open format experience. But Camp Omega was, was pretty small and there were, you know, guards everywhere. It was really hard to get away. But in the Phantom Pain, you really do have so many more different angles of attack, uh, you know, or to sneak in and to sneak out if you really have to to sort of, you know, uh, reset that, that mission, if you will. Sure. Yeah, that was the thing is like, I think it's, you know, it's so cliche now to be like, tackle mission anyway you want. But this one, this one really felt like that, right? 'Cause I go back and replay the missions, especially 'cause it's just like, you know, uh, Peace Walker, where, all right, you have night vision goggles and then three hours later, I've upgraded my night vision goggles and they do this on top of that.

And so to go back and suddenly be able to play it a completely different way, you know, to go back and, all right, now I want to do this mission at night rather, you know, I, I, it took me a while to get my head wrapped around that of like, oh, like, I want to play every one of these missions at night and put on my night vision go. Absolutely. I mean, that to me, you know, it's a game. Metal Gear is typically a game where you sort of progress, you know, through the story, you know, one segment after another. But you really do have the time and the freedom to do whatever you want. And if that's replaying a mission, you should do it, because, you know, changing tonight doesn't only just make give you the cover of darkness, but it also changes",

Uh, what really struck me was when I started seeing guards wearing night vision goggles. Yeah, I was like, no, God, that was supposed to be easier. But yeah, no, it's, it's a great game that is, is really challenging no matter how you play it, and that incentivizes you to go back because of that challenge. So now the thing I've struggled with talking to the other Kinda Funny guys or just friends who are in the industry, I'm not breaking the Embargo, Konami, I swear, about explaining Phantom Pain, right? Is the fact that it's open world, but it's not open world in like the way Witcher is open world, right? Where I'm going to all four in the corner and there's an exclamation over here and I get that mission while I'm still on my other mission and I can do",

Where I'm going to all four in the corner and there's an exclamation over here and I get that mission while I'm still on my other mission and I can do whatever and switch him. Go right before you roll out from, you know, Mother Base or whatever, you are saying like, this is the mission I'm going out in. You can say you want to go out and just harvest resources. You can get dropped with no mission objective on top of you. Yeah, but I find it so hard to say, well, it's open world, but it's not open world, but it is open world, because it's like not everything's available on one map. You jump in and can go from point A to point B and do a million things. But there are missions that are like that. And the environments are so big that you can go off and do different things. Like, yeah, getting ready for your preview up on GameSpot right now, of course, uh, has it been hard for you to try to figure out how to phrase all of this and put it in? See, I, I guess I do see it as",

See, I, I guess I do see it as an open world, but it's one that is like segmented, because, you know, initially, right, you're in Afghanistan. Yeah, which is a massive location. I mean, Kojima says that Phantom Pain is supposed to be 200 times larger than Ground Zeroes. I bet 50 of those Camp Omegas are in Afghanistan alone. And, uh, and, you know, I actually spent a lot of time doing Side Ops and sort of taking those on. So I guess in that regard, I, I felt, I never felt pressured to do one thing or another. I felt as though had the freedom to explore the territory, you know, uh, work on, you know, getting people back to Mother Base and upgrading that stuff. So it's, yeah, it's not exactly the open world that everyone usually thinks of when they think of say open world in a video game, right? You think like GTA, like there's this map, there's missions all over it.",

Yeah, I mean, but you do unlock more missions, right? And there is something to say about how you explore the map, because, you know, without going into story details, depending on where you are, you will trigger events that are independent of where you are in the mission timeline, right? Um, I don't know if you experienced that. Yeah, again, not spoiling, we're not get in trouble for spoiling the story. But yeah, I was like, oh, I'm taking what I loved about it, right? 'Cause for me, what was happening was I went the opposite way of one how I played Peace Walker, uh, the review event for Peace Walker back in the day, because that one I was like, I'm reviewing this, I'm going to play through all the story missions and I'll get to Side Ops later.",

So I'm just going to do Side Op stuff and fool around and see how things work. So I'd be going off on Side Ops and be like, oh, okay, now I'm going over here. And you'd go up through the hill or whatever, and then bam, all of a sudden this person would interject that would create their mission that you would have to go do to find that character to flesh out that character. Yeah, it's that emergent stuff that we sometimes see in open world games. Um, and, you know, personally, like, I, I enjoy just going about Afghanistan like, and then all of a sudden discovering, oh, crap, there's an enemy outpost I didn't see coming.

And that opens up a lot of gameplay possibilities as well that are out of missions. Um, so I was, I was able to keep myself busy. And of course, as you go through the story missions, you then unlock more Side Ops. And as you explore and do things randomly, you also unlock more Side Ops. I was looking at the, uh, the list of missions at the end of the, the second day, and there are numbers next to the, the mission. So you know, okay, there are this many. Yeah, I unlocked one that was 145. Yeah, it was super Peace Walker-y. You know, I have faith that like, give it another day with the game or another two that I would have 20, 30 missions that I was just waiting. And I think that's gonna be the difference, right? Is just the fact of like, I think when I'm playing on my save and I'm being very meticulous about building out my teams and research and getting my points where I",

But these systems put in there, that's when it'll be, I think, a little more organic in terms of like, well, now I want to play the story and I want to invest all this time in there. 'Cause I eventually, it was like, we were, I think, at dinner that night and somebody's like, oh, I did this and I found that person. Like, ****, I got to start playing this goddamn story, you know what I mean? Just to get to those points to see how it all flushes out and flushes to get out and flushes out and comes together, not flushes together, even though that would make sense too. Stem cells in the research we're doing, they could easily flesh together one day. So we're weeks removed from playing it. What do you keep thinking about from",

What do you keep thinking about from the game? H, uh, Mother Base. Yeah, honestly. Yeah, yeah. Um, because, you know, Afghanistan is its own thing, but Mother Base is yours and you put a lot of time and energy into developing it. And one of the things that that struck me about it was when you start to build more and more struts that are attached to the main one, you have these, these long bridges. And I thought, oh, I'll just run across that bridge. Like two minutes later, I'm still running. Yeah, it's like, I should have taken that jeep in the beginning. Like Mother Base is gigantic. And being able to finally like have a tangible Mother Base to explore and, you know, see the fruits of your labor pay off, that's something like you were saying earlier, I want to be more meticulous about developing the different, um, you know, teams there, struts.

Yeah, 'cause it definitely helps when you're in the field. And so that relationship between, you know, Snake working solo, but also with a remote team that he's responsible for, that was one of my favorite parts. Yeah, that was weird. I, I, when I, when we started doing, I'm like, oh, it's like Peace Walker. I'm building a Mother Base, great. I'm have all this stress or whatever. When it was finally like, all right, cool, now meet me, Snake, on the medical Bay. And you're like, okay, oh, it's all the way over there. Like, oh, crap, do I take the, should I get in a helicopter? A realistic consideration. Like, you actually can go everywhere and do everything on it. And like, for me, being the, you know, this Metal Gear nerd, right?

That sticks with you until when you're at Mother Base, you go into one of the shower stalls and shower off and come out super clean. And like, the fact you have to go through and like, you know, keep people's morale up by saluting them and talking to them. Oh, by saluting them. What, dude, you smack a soldier in the face. Like, thank you, thank you, Boss. I mean, and then it says loyalty up, right? Like, that is just such a little Metal Gear touch. And Phantom Pain can be really melodramatic, Metal Gear game. Um, but that's kind of what's nice. And then it's tempered with just the odd sort of humor peppered in there. Yeah, I really like that.

Yeah, it was challenging, you know? Yeah, it sort of legitimized the presence of that even more. And, uh, I'm looking forward to how multiplayer plays out, because from what I understand, like the, the core strut will always be there, right? Like you'll always have your Mother Base, but people can come in and destroy all the things you've made around it. So I really want to know how that plays out.

I just want to play this thing for hours and hours and hours. Yeah, hours in. I think I was like 8% done, right? 'Cause it tells you on the title screen, which is just insane. Yeah, day one completion, I think I wrote my note was, yeah, 5% after a day of playing. Five. I was at four, Z-L-O-U, you know what I mean? Let, let alone everything else. So for me, the thing I can't stop thinking about, and I think it's because again, I'm playing The Witcher and stuff, is the support system, the Buddies. Yeah, you know what I mean?

I don't need, I don't need any sense of realism on where this goddamn horse is materializing from. But as you play, then like, did you unlock D-Dog? I did. Yeah, like there's this, I can't tell you, I guess the mission of how it all happens or whatever, but you eventually unlock this D-Dog that you've seen in screenshots now that you use the same way. And I didn't understand when I, you unlock D-Dog, that it's like, okay, that's one of your Buddies. Like, that's your first introduction of like, the horse is a Buddy that you can",

Yeah, and you don't realize you have a choice until D-Dog matures, let's say, to be, you know, strong enough to go into the field. And so you start with the horse. And the horse is, yeah, it's a means of conveyance, but it's also a really good way to, uh, to sneak around the world. I mean, they've shed this in videos before where Snake is coming up and he sees an enemy outpost. So rather than get off the horse, you know, and sort of sneak through, he just sort of flips on to the side of it. Yeah, and, uh, that worked really well.

So like, hey, there's a guy on the side of the horse. God damn it. You know what I really want to know? Um, I know we both encountered a bear in the wilderness. Oh my God. So I wasn't able to, uh, use the Fulton Recovery System to send him back. Yeah, because you have to develop it to get something that large back to base.

Oh, no, like, I got a strut that's like, it's an animal sanctuary where you're sending things back and they're all in cages and you can, you can just go there and walk around and read the little things about them and see them in there, the things you captured and sent back. That's so useless, but I like it. I know, right? It's so dumb. But I'm like, yeah, of course I want to do that and send a bear back. That bear kept killing me, dude. I, yeah, I mean, the first time I saw him, I was like, whatever, I'll trank him in the head. He's so fast. He took me",
