Nick, Nick Scarpino, the good old arcade box. Remember we used to, they had this, they installed arcade. You know what? Go, you take your attitude and stuff it in a sock, my friend, and then and then beat the **** out of that sock because that's what your attitude can go. You can go right with Kevin over there.

Kevin's really smart and I guess you're going to be Dive and I'm going to be Kick. Yeah, you're wearing all blue and ****. I like that. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but the whole point of this game is just, you just have one button, right? There's two buttons. One is for Dive and one's for Kick . Don't be stupid, Nick. Okay, no. Oh, you just **** up. What'd I do? So now your Dive is R? What the ****? Why would my Dive be R? You just, no, hit hit retry. Circle. What do you want your Dive to be? Okay, you ready for that?
