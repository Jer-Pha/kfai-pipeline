Let's say over the span of a month some sort of breakthrough technology comes out obviously we need to train change the tech and everything but where we just don't need them and what I think is it's going to lead to more extremist groups to be able to pop up because they've nothing else the one Lifeline the world is just cut.

How do the how does the food get to the stores? How does how does gas get to the gas stations right?

Yeah, what happens to the rest of the world where there's a massive Surplus that comes in and then how does that work you know they'll find other markets I think I think I mean it would it would cause oil to drop in price significantly but you have Russia manufacturing oil China's a huge buyer of oil obviously Russia's giving a lot of it oil to Eastern Europe and and Western Europe I mean that's when when Europe when Russia invaded uh Ukraine the reason Western Europe didn't want to get involved because they were afraid they going to be cut off so like oil like and they would have been cut off so like they like couldn't like Russia invaded we saw Russia invade",
