Greg, yeah, the handlebar mustache is creeping me out a little bit. I was still it isn't a handlebar mustache for an audio listener'cause that would have it come off and go up into the curls, right? And then this is a what's the one with what's the sea Pitt's creepy ass? I'm going to fuck, I'm like, fuck , we like, we there. It's a very Victor, it's a twirly mustache, but a twirly mustache. That's what it is. It's a twirly mustache. This a mustache. All right, interesting. Handlebars are too low, I think. No, it's like a like a Harley handlebar upside down. Hulk Hogan. Yeah, Hulk Hogan. All right, I think you should keep it going. No , I think you keep going and then and then just spring it on us that you just dye it like blonde one day. Just blonde.

Get Kevin out there to get some bleach. Kevin, can you get some peroxide? Will work too, really? It might burn his face, but yeah, hydrogen peroxide will work. You dye your hair with peroxide. I don't suggest it. Over there, the pride of Long Island, Colin. Already good to be here with you, Greg. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. Your beard looks good. Thank you.

Um, I'm quick background about myself. I'm a TL20 under 20 fellow, OIC grad, and I'm actually in TechStars right now. So, um , wait, TechStars, is that like Dancing with the Stars but for basically for techy shit? That would be amazing. It's a bunch of tech guys trying to dance. It's that'd be awesome.

So Y Combinator, uh which is in Mountain View, is the most competitive. You have companies that came out of there like Reddit, Dropbox, Airbnb. Um, then you have Parse, Heroku, and a few other ones. But um, TechStars are the second one to them. The only time I've ever heard incubators has been in like Marvel Comics when they're referring to Reed Richards. What about chickens? When you got little chick. That too. That too. But I'm going to put him with the Reed Richards. That's fine. No, I understand that. No, he's a smart guy. He's not a chicken hatcher over here.

Yeah , so um, I've been a big fan of you guys since you guys were doing Beyond. Never heard of you. You're not even going to say Beyond. You really forgot about when you say it's in context.

So yeah, so um, I've been a huge fan and um, I basically reached out to Colin and just said that uh I wanted to get get involved any way I could.

Yeah, usually it's the opposite. Totally. Everything takes a long time and Kevin has to lose an arm and it ends up like just a disaster and not how you want.

Uh, but we built a system that's basically integrated into like all of the doctor notes around the United States. So uh people can check their health insurance because before this you had to call up and they'd wait till the end of the day after you had a visit and then they'd call the insurance companies and it would take forever. And every time the insurance company picks up the phone, they lose $3. They lose $3 because the calling centers are so expensive. Oh, wow. Okay. So it's a great way to get paid on both ends.

He told me today, uh, by the way, I learned this, uh, was going to go to Northeastern, decided not to go to college, scorned Northeastern and did his own thing instead and now look at him. You know what? Northeastern has never been the same. No, they'll never never bounce back. No, we're not. No. Well, the funny thing is is that if if you went to Northeastern, there could have been an alternate history timeline where uh you put them on the map for tech'cause right now they're really not on the like like the biggest thing for tech that ever came out of Northeastern is Napster.

So, you know, like engineering and all that kind of stuff and hockey. Yeah. Uh, and me, of course. Uh, so there's an alternate history timeline where you could have went there and had a and had your own building by the time you were 25 there. Uh, but you you scorned Northeastern . It would looked exactly like the Avengers Tower, Stark Tower. That's what I was going for actually. Um, yeah, in all honesty, I think if I went to Northeastern, I wouldn't have studied computer science. Um,'cause in high school, I already knew a lot about computer science and um, going to college, they don't really know. You'll learn a lot about theories, but not applying it.

Plus Northeastern is a lot of money, so you're saving yourself a couple hundred thousand dollars from not being there. You made a good call. You're like, I can either make money or spend money. I feel like it's an interesting that's an interesting uh concept though because a lot of people don't think that, right? Like you your path to success is always outlined as you get good grades in in high school, then you go to good college, then you go to good college, do four years, get a great GPA, intern, and then go work for a company. And that's what you do. And that doesn't have to be that. It's never actually had to be that way, truth be told. But I think the popular perception is that still and it's pretty fascinating",

There never will be. Absolutely. And I think that's what it excited me about Northeastern was the co-op program. But I mean, the way Peter Thiel puts it, which is why he started the fellowship that I'm in, is um, there's a time companies are like waves, if you think about it that way. There's only there's a time and a place to catch it. And once it passes, it's gone. Mhm. You can catch it too early or too late. So he's his whole theory is not bashing college necessarily. It's more that you're losing time. If you have an idea for a startup, do it now. Why wait till you're done with college by'cause it's too late.'Cause by then, yeah, it'll be obsolete.

Oh my God, I'd love that. I would totally wear that as a badge of honor. No, but that's that's very true . Um, and it's sort of, I mean, we can sympathize, right? Like we wanted to do this where we felt like this was, you know, in January was a good time for us to sort of leave and take advantage of some of the things out there and form our company. That's not exactly the most groundbreakingly unique idea anyone's ever come up with.

You seem to you have a good left brain on and I always and I always am always envious with people with left like that are left-brained, like very left-brained because I feel like I'm significantly right-brained, which is probably what we all are in our own way, like in this company.

In other words, you're not you're you're Wozniak and Jobs like those two mentalities kind of put together. Like Jobs is really more of the right brain and Wozniak was the left brain. They work together. Well, I'm always really envious and jealous of people that have a left brain that works because uh I love physics. I love chemistry.

So you mean like Venezuela? You mean Saudi Arabia? You mean Kuwait? You mean, yeah, I mean, even the UAE. Like now they have tourism and stuff, but all of their money is in gas, right? It's interesting. I I I mean, I'm of the mind that, you know, I I love these weird documentaries too.

There's a I think they were talking about how they they brought up, um, shit, I think it's It's Brazil as they are 100% self-sufficient. And the reason they are is because they they offer cars that are switch cars, they're I think they're called or flex-fuel cars where basically you can choose gas or ethanol. And there's a little switch that like you hit. It's just a computer that changes what tank it's taking the it takes changes a little bit of how the engine works and how it processes the fuel. But that's pretty much it. Um, and they're 100% self-sufficient right now. Yeah, ethanol is not the answer either though.

And I remember my dad talking about the fuel cell and all this stuff when I was a kid. And and uh it just has never happened because there's such entrenched interests in keeping the oil companies afloat. And we see that see that constantly.

The and again, the big ones to me are Venezuela, Russia, uh and especially the Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and all these other countries. Like and the answer is they're fucked because they sacrificed I think smartly so maybe a diverse diversifying their economy because they were making hand over fist money, you know, on oil for decades and decades term in pipelines.

Yeah, because we we know like we know like if if something catastrophic happened in the Persian Gulf especially and like we weren't able to get oil out of there and extract oil, we'd be so fucked. We have a reserve, uh but it's only a few months worth. So we we we always like stock away like three months worth of oil, whatever. And there's probably way strategic reserve is probably way more for the military and stuff like that in case we get invaded or something. But um those countries are in a lot of trouble.
