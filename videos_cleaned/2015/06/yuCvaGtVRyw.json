            "text": "Hi everyone, I'm **Shuhei Yoshida**, President of **Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios** and the proud patron of **Kinda Funny**. Like many of you, welcome to the **Kinda Funny Press Conference**. You know that I love press conferences, and I'm very excited to be here with you, but actually, I'm not there with you in person. I have many other things to attend to, but my heart is with you anyway. So **Greg** asked me to open this conference like any other great press conference, to look at charts and graphs first. And as you can see here, company has grown from zero to something. So that's the numbers part, and you know, we are going to do lots of great stuff, and I hope you enjoy. And that's my part. Ciao, bye.",
