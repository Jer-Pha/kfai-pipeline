Someone gave me a really good one. Uh, this this will be a fun one for you guys. Magical Ham says , give me the title of each of your biopics or biopics depending on you, right? I've always said it that way, but going off of Tim's subject, if they were to make a documentary about all of us or one of us or each and each of us individually, what would the name of your D your your uh your biopic be? I'd always thought I when I when I left college, right, and I was bumming around writing a bit and stuff outside of the newspaper, I I was putting the I had an outline for a book about everything I had done in college and I was going to call it I was a blue-haired antler, but now I've come so that could be the College Years of me, right? But I've done so much more now, right? Greg's will be whacked out beyond belief, the Greg Miller Story. Sure, that's not bad. It's",

Maybe piss and Dixie Cups. Yeah, sounds like my country music. I to pier in them dick cups all night and day for mag weird time signature on that. Yeah, that weird. Sorry, earlier I said, uh, the you can't spell TMI without T. I feel like there's something in there, like something's in there. T TMI with TI. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. I I feel like all of our monikers or or these uh these nicknames that Greg has bestowed upon us famously would work very, very well, especially for Colin, Pride of Long Island.

I'm spry. Jerry Seinfeld hasn't he's not going to pun. I don't know. I just thought I feel like it's you know, that was a name given to me. So if someone wanted to name the documentary that they made about me, I guess I would allow it, but if it was a documenter had any power and I was like, I can't I can't in good faith let you name me this because this is what I'm called here on the internet, but there are certainly, you know, quite a few people from Long Island that might take issue with this, you know, including people that are actually significantly famous for things that they actually did, but they don't have documentaries about them.

True, that's the difference. I'm going to go for you. This is the easy answer. Colin was right. That's really good. I like Producer Seducer though. I mean, Producer Seducer would work for me. Story of Seduction. Yeah, and production. That's the tale in protheses and a little bit of production, but I would want it if someone made a documentary about me, I would want it I would want to write it and I would want it to be completely false, just completely nonsensical and completely like seems like the the opposite of a biopic, but that's wouldn't that be more fun? Like my life is cool. We did some cool ****, but like I would love it much more if it was like every other story was me like going into space or saving children in space or like putting out a fire in space.

Magic School Bus spiraling out of control. That's hilarious. Um, Producer Stud would be be good for me, I think. Yeah, it is good. Pretty much famous on the internet. Internet Superstars would be good. Superstars. I like that. Internet Superstar, the pure one for Tim is amazing. Sounds it sounds like a wrestler, a pure one. Yeah, yeah, it does. You see that the pure one? I don't know. That's a good name for a documentary about no, we know sold on you, the pure one, the untold story. It's always the untold story, but I mean, like I feel like my story is going to be pretty well told. Yeah, our whole all our stor they're all documented right here.

Um, he's a liar. He's not a truth tell teller. H back see the thing about documentaries and like we talk about you know Greg's documentary complete nonsense to Greg Miller Story is that the reality is if we ever did a documentary where they were like oh let's go back and talk to Colin's teachers or something like that or whatever they'd all be like who the **** are you talking about it's been oh yeah 10 years I've had thousands of pupils since then he was a very unremarkable person clearly it would only really start maybe after college or something where people would really probably remember me except for my friends and family of course and people I interact with but I don't think you're going",
