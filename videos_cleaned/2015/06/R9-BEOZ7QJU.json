I'm joined by the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. Oh, I'm the Champion for the first time on the Kinda Funny Gamescast. Hi Justine. Hi, I was I I voiced to them. I was like, I'm not a dude. Well, there you're not. No, that that's our moniker. I just assumed that you were talking about everybody here. I was like, I'm not a dude, but I can be a dude. I'll be you are one of the coolest dudes from now on. You were one of the coolest dudes in video games. I just did. This is going to be great. This is going to be great. So the Nintendo Direct just happened. We're going to run through all the announcements and then we'll discuss them. It started off with Star Fox Zero on the Wii U coming holiday 2015. I'm excited for that one. Then Super Mario Maker, they talked about it a bit. They showed that there's a bunch of costumes for you to be Wii Fit Trainer, Zelda, like or Link.",

Zelda is actually the princess in that game. Spoilers. Great spoilers. Um, September 11th, 2015 is when we're getting that guy. No respect. Then Skylanders, big announcement that came out of nowhere. They're making Bowser and Donkey Kong Skylanders that are also amiibos. They can do everything. So so that's there's that. Then Zelda: Tri Force Heroes announced, which is essentially Three Sword Adventures, uh, on the 3DS. Then Hyrule Warriors Legends, which leaked a while back, but uh, it's coming to 3DS first quarter 2016. Metroid Prime: Federation Force. People thought this was going to be called Ball Blasters or some ****, but that would be a better name. Um, and it's first quarter 2016 3DS Prime Ball Buster. Yeah. Uh, then Fire Emblem Fates.

I'm excited. 2016. 30 new characters to Smash. Yes, which is exciting. Um, Fire Emblem x Shin Megami Tensei. We saw a trailer. It didn't make any sense 'cause it wasn't in English and I didn't understand what they were doing. There's a lot of dancing around. Um, so that was cool. Then Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer. I knew she'd like that. 3DS. Then Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival on Wii U. It's like Mario Party, but it's a festival and there's amiibos involved. Then Yoshi's Woolly World. Hell yeah. Did they get a release date for that? I didn't write that down. I don't know. I I was kind of just staring at those gorgeous amiibos. I'll Google for you, but I don't think they did.",

Then Yo-kai Watch, which might be the one thing that Colin in the conference was like, wait, what's happening? Yeah, I forgot that Yo-kai Watch is actually coming out. That game was massive in Japan. So it's, you know, Level-5. I love Level-5. Great developers. So I'm excited about that, but not the game I'm most excited about on this list. Then a new title, Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. Oh, I missed this. This I was on my way here. Yes. What? Tell me. This is a genius game because it combines the Paper Mario world with the Mario & Luigi world into one RPG world and it's called Paper Jam 'cause they're jamming them together. I'm all about that.

This new amiibo where it's a 30th Anniversary amiibo and you can do a bunch of stuff with it. Mario Maker and all that stuff. So that was the Direct and then it ended. There was no, can we back to that 30th Anniversary amiibo? 'Cause yeah, we can. What was it? So it's it looks like the little 8-bit Mario. It's huge. It's a big old one. Yeah, really? Oh my God, I'm so obsessed with. I honestly have a separate house for my amiibos. And now with all these new announcements, like it's it's yeah, there's going to be a lot of amiibos.

Oh man, and it looked good. Pretty awesome. That really sold the game to me. Like to me that is my one of my contenders for the game of the show for sure. Mario Maker. Mario Maker, of course. The potential there is endless. I cannot wait to play what other people make. I'm going to fool around with making them myself, but not really my my thing. I don't I want to play games.

You know, I mean, you can share the stuff on Twitter. I mean, I'm sure you guys are going to make some Kinda Funny crazy games. Something be Kinda Funny. Yeah, the g- the game looks extraordinary. I mean, just, you know, the one thing that made me cringe is a guy who studied history and worked at a Massachusetts Historical Society when I was in college is watching them and I was saying it over and over watching them handle those design documents with the hex art on them and stuff like that from the '80s. I'm like, why are you touching these things? And and our friend Scott Sinowski, sin, yeah, who works over at Apple. We used to work with him at IGN and tweeted out. He's like, it's",

Put them in a museum. When they're talking about Maker, Miyamoto actually had the original designs for like their the first Mario levels that they like hand drew and stuff. So and they're just like throwing them on the table and like folding. I'm like, what the f- like, how is someone how do they not like cognizant enough to know that those belong in a museum somewhere? That was that was actually what I I walked away from most from that conference. Actual original one. Yeah, I mean, they they looked like the original ones.

Now they're gone. Now. Yeah. So Mario Maker, we've seen it a million times, but it's really good to finally have a release date and it's pretty soon. September 11th is not that far away. Yeah, I'm ex- I'm I'm I'm through the roof about that game. Really. Like I I just, you know, Mario made a gamer out of many of us, including me. And I couldn't help but smile when they were showing the montages of all the games and stuff like that. Those are games that we hold near and dear to us. They even showed Super Mario Sunshine, which I thought was funny. Yeah. Um, which I still really like that game. I love that. I love that game too.

Um, and it's funny to hear how it seemed like they were tools that they use internally that they then just made into a game. Um, so I don't know. I'm excited about it. It's one of the only games there that was interesting. That's one of the things. Mario Maker was the most interesting game. I think the most interesting announcement was the Skylanders amiibo hybrid. Like that's really. We've talked about it before that Nintendo is tone deaf and doesn't listen. Is trying to pivot itself. And you really see them with, you know, the announcement, obviously the mobile stuff. Now with this announcement, they're working with Activision that they're trying to get their properties out there. Get it to new people. Get it to where",

Get it to new people. Get it to where kids are. So they they figure out, oh, Donkey Kong and Dry Bones sure are cool dudes. We need to go play those other games. Not to mention that those you can then crank the base and they go from being a Skylander to being an amiibo, which is brilliant. Well, I think that's the problem too, is the amiibo. There's not much you can do with them. Like I mean, once you tap them on your console, great. I have like a costume. I can, you know, do only a few things. And you just set them on your shelf and they look cool. So I think they really do need to kind of expand that. And I like that they that they start saying it was like the transformation. I mean, they're going into mobile. I mean, this is going to be huge. Yeah, yeah. I feel like with I mean, I've said it before about amiibo, like they should have just made toys and",

Like that. Like just release your awesome toys with these awesome sculpts of all these great action figures, basically. And one day, one day they have a plan for where it's going, right? They have an idea of what they want to do with this thing eventually. But right now, I think I think it's the the thing of they it's marketing for their games. You know, it's like I feel like there's a bunch of copies of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker that were sold because of amiibo just because it had functionality. You know what I mean? People just bought it. But I mean, like what what we always go back to when we need to get back to what was actually announced.

If there was some cool packing like that that unlocked a game, that'd be awesome. Mhm. Yeah, definitely. So for me, Star Fox. We need to talk about Star Fox. It's kind of exciting. Oh yeah. I mean, they've been talking about it forever. It's like, oh my God. Yeah. So to finally see it, I was very excited. It I'm happy that it is uh, on-rails shooter. There's the all-range mode. It is classic Star Fox. There was no on-foot shenanigans going on like an robot. There was a Transformer thing that I thought looked cool. Okay.

Because even playing Splatoon, I mean, they were really trying to get you to really play with them motion controls. And it that's default settings, but then I turned it off immediately because it's just not how we're accustomed to playing games. And I don't feel like it's that accurate. That the thing with that is, and I've been scared about this for a while, specifically with Star Fox, because they've been talking about they they want this to be the Wii U GamePad game. And I'm really excited that when he was talking, he said you can use motion, you can use the game the gyros around. Um, but then the way they were showing it, I was like, oh man, I don't know how they would without. So it's like that scares me a little bit. I definitely want to",

It's it's a different type of game if you were to play it with the GamePad because then you're controlling your ship and aiming separately, whereas Star Fox is it's one thing typically. You know what I mean? So I I hope that I can play it old school style. Um, 'cause it definitely is very exciting to me. Like this is Star Fox. You've been waiting a long, long time. To the hype though, is the question. What what did you see? Were you like, that looks awesome? You see, this is what I wanted. And the thing there is, it's like, was it a beautiful game? No, it really wasn't. It was like kind of empty in a lot of ways. But I don't need that much going on for Star Fox. Like it it looked like Star Fox 64, but you know, nicer in HD.

And you got games like Mario Galaxy, which is arguably not an HD, even in arguably the prettiest game of that generation. Um, and I was looking at Star Fox. I'm like, this game and I t- we were talking about. I was like, this game looks ancient. Like it doesn't even look old. Like this game actually looks really old. He goes, it took 10 years to make this. Yeah, like I I don't what have they been doing? I I was I don't care. I don't really care about the graphical fidelity.

And this is a very late this might be arguably the last or one of the last first party games on Wii U. So I you expected more out of it. It was clearly a game that has been in development for a while. Yeah, the look of it kind of reminded me of um Hyrule Warriors where it doesn't look like the Zelda game. You know what I mean? It has the elements and stuff and it's pretty and it's it's like, you know, the fidelity of it is nice, but it's just like there's not that much going on and it it looks kind of empty and barren.

There's nothing wrong with it. Yeah, for sure. I I totally get that. But I don't even want to be that negative about it. I am negative about this Direct. I was not thrilled by it.

And you know, a game like Yo-kai Watch coming over from, you know, Level-5 is a great Japanese developer. Uh, they did, you know, um, most recently did Ni no Kuni.

Um, and I don't think they're worried about any of that kind of stuff. I think their bigger problem is just like in the console space and in the future. And again, this is just an off-year. This is just a bad year for them because they have to just get everything out that's in the pipeline and clear the pipeline and then start. Yeah, with the NX, as Greg likes to keep doing his X symbol, of course. Um, it's hard too because they paved the way with like, all right, they launched the Wii U first.

Like we've talked about with the exception of the Wii, which is the anomaly. Ever since NES, that the sales decline in Nintendo has been precipitous. You know, NES sold this. SNES sold below that. N64 sold below that. GameCube sold below that. And then the Wii was the big spike. And then and then Wii U is awful. Wii U is in sub-Dreamcast levels. So Wii U is awful in terms of sales.

I think it already is just for Mario Kart and Smash and like Mario 3D World. Those three games alone make it worth the investment to me. And adding these, it's like, definitely it's a great system that I've played a lot of great games on. But had a good time playing Mario Party. I mean, these are the type of things that that kind of brings back like, you know, actually having people over to your house and playing games together. So kind of like going back to sort of I don't know how it used to be back in the day when we local play when we didn't play, you know, Call of Duty online and just had fun.

They're making more casual games now with DeNA and stuff in Japan. Um, with their cell phone games and stuff like that. But I do believe that they can turn things around. They just have to figure it out. They have the greatest game design and development talent in the entire industry. So that that's taken care of. You just have to proliferate those games and get people to buy your console. That's why I was surprised that they didn't cut the price. You know, like Wii U is way too expensive. And you know, I would buy like we share basically a Wii U and an Xbox One. That's why, you know, I don't I don't buy them for well, because Greg has it's like, what? I'm not going to buy them.

You know, so I'm sur- like I was I was sure in our predictions when we did our predictions that they were going to cut the price of the Wii U. Yeah, maybe they still will. I just feel like they feel like they don't need E3 to make the announcements. And it kind of reminds me of like when Apple was like, you know what? We're not going to make all of our announcements here. We're going to have our own separate things. 'Cause they used to make them all at Macworld. And they're like, no, we're going to pull away from that so that we can do anything we want when we want.

I mean, I liked being able to whenever playing Smash, you know, take your little character to somebody else's house. All ra- over your your clone. So so Justine, what do you think about the the 3DS games announced? Like there was a handful. We got Zelda: Tri Force Heroes, Hyrule Warriors Legends, Metroid Prime: Federation Force, new Fire Emblem, and then Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer. Never played Fire Emblem.

I think that's something that all of us DS Nintendo fans, we really love that. So I love all of like the mini DS games. So I'm hoping that they do some more kind of stuff like that. Yeah, well, you want to talk about the predictions? Oh yeah, sure. You okay. Well, I want to call we talked about in the beginning. Yoshi's Woolly World did get a release date on this thing. What is it? It's not good news for you. Damn it. Are you serious? It's in Australia, June 25th. In Europe, June 26th. In Japan, July 16th. Here in the United States, October 16th. I'm sorry. What?

I will say to to your to your point about the Direct format before we get into the predictions that we made. Um, I like the Direct format.

Like until you like they have a more metered approach, a more structured approach that Nintendo is like that. They don't they don't want to risk any leaks. They don't want to do those kinds of things. But you lose a little bit of you get personality from Reggie and those guys, but you also lose a little bit of personality, I think.
