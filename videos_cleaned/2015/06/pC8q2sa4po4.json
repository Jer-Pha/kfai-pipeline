You you can't tell that cuz this this fake sun we put in the room makes it look like the same thing. But I've been looking over on KindaFunny.com/forums and over on our NeoGAF community thread and one of the big things we hear is you want longer let's plays . But the problem of course during the day is that we do the GameOverGreggy show the Kinda Funny Gamescast Colin & Greg Live normal emailing planning for E3 planning for Comic-Con planning for a million other things that doing let's plays every day means that it's hard to do really long ones often. So I thought tonight I would jump back into The Witcher 3 and bring you along for the ride for a long let's play. Let's say about an hour. Um you're looking here of course at my skill tree. Uh I've obviously been playing quite a bit since Colin and I",

You can see now I'm level 1 which is nothing to sneeze at and how long it takes to level up this game. And a heads up if you are uh really into The Witcher I'm doing side quests. One of the side quests I have right now is kind of story though. Like I'm going to we're going to pop out here in a second and it's not like I'm involved with any of the characters but I'm a thing I didn't expect has happened. So a heads up that it's going to be a little spoilery there but 1 all these other things. jumping into it now. And Geralt is in prison. I am in prison right now. Geralt uh Mr. Geralt in prison.
