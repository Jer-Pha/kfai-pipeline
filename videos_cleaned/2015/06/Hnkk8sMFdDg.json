My name is Colin, this is Tim, and Tim today in celebration of Fallout 4 is somewhat imminent release, I think, yes, we're going to play Fallout 3, a game you've never played before, one of my favorite games of all time. I just know people like this a lot. That's I I know people love this game. I honestly have no idea what it is. I thought it was a first person thing yesterday. I heard Nick talking about it and he's like, oh, you could also do third person. Didn't you could do third person. So scroll while we're talking, scroll down, hit new, it'll pop up. Uh, you know, yes, and then we're going to go in and play the game. It's going to load up. There's a little intro and then we're going to start the very beginning. Now, I haven't even turned this game on probably since the DLC came out in early 2009, Fort Pitt and all those really awesome pieces of DLC. Here's the background that we need him.

Yes, Fallout 1 and 2 were different kinds of games in Fallout 3 and one, but as the game studio started making Fallout 3 in the in the image really of the way they did Oblivion, uh, which is the Elder STS 4, it was a new kind of game and it got people really excited. It came out in, uh, fall of 2008 on PS3, on Xbox 360, and on PC. Um, and it is considered one of the great Western role playing games of all time and it takes place after a nuclear war between China and the United States that lasts exactly one day on October 3rd, 2077, mutually assured destruction, everything's destroyed. And now in this particular game you're in Washington DC or as they call it the the Capital Wasteland in in, um, in Fallout L, similar to how in Fallout 4 it takes place in Massachusetts, which in Fallout is called the Commonwealth.

Um, the game's very interesting and I'm I'm interested to see how you we'll play it as long as you feel like you want to play it. I'd like to get out of the Vault, okay, which will take Vault 101, Vault 101 , which will take any amount of time depending on how how fast you want to play the game, okay? Um, because I think it's at that point when the feeling of awe that everyone gets on a play Fallout 3 will be realized not in the very beginning. I'm excited about this. I've always like the tone of the game and the the it definitely has a realized world. That's cool. Absolutely. Um, and there's the little dude.

This is basically showing you Washington DC after the the the ruins and everything's as it was in 2077 and the game takes place decades after that. Um, there are mutants and humans that are still surviving their currency are bottle caps from the top of Coke bottles. Um, and this is a guy from the Brotherhood of Steel, um, who are basically one of the factions in the game, neither good nor bad depending on how you treat them. Um, and this is a game much like Mass Effect in other games where your choices matter when you kill someone in the game, he's dead permanently or she's dead permanently.

Hold on a second. Oh, ****. Oh, you skipped the you skipped the uh Lord, the intro. It doesn't really matter. I was trying to get some subtitles on so I can read the ****. Now let's see how long it takes to actually load because it probably wasn't loaded yet in the background. That's why those things exist. I don't think people some people realize that a lot of these things exist just to get rid of horrible load times. Did I miss anything important there?

That's why Fallout 4 seems so different because for one your character actually talks which doesn't happen in this game. Um, indicating that you might have more of a force on the story.
