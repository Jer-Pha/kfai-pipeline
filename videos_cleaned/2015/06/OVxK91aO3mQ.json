Now this resonated with me because I'm a big fan of a lot of little things, so it's like games like Amplitude get me super excited. They're not the biggest games, you know, but they are ones that I'm going to sink a lot of time into. And I remember walking around the show floor and looking around just being like, tons of things that I was like, oh ****, that's playable. Oh ****, this is here. And like no one even talked about it. Like Ratchet & Clank comes to mind. That game looks so good. A couple weeks ago we saw the trailer and it was just like, oh crap, this looks good. Yeah, it was playable on the show floor and I was like, how the hell is this? No one's talking about it. Oh, it's because they wore out their welcome. The damage is done. Stop making Ratchet & Clank games. No, no, no, it don't",

And then I also saw Journey on PS4, which they've shown like 10 million times. It's really interesting, like where is that? Like why is that not just, it's out. Yeah, I know, right? That's the thing that we've heard about that game forever. It's like, okay, do it, pooper, get off the pot. Um, so I'll tell you a game, I'm a fan of these small games too. A game that I was surprised I didn't think about, forgotten all about, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, the game that I said was currently my game of the year. Like I got, I was on there, people started tweeting me like, hey, you're going to give one of your awards to Metal Gear Solid V. And I was like, all right, Metal Gear Solid V is here and it's not",

It's just like, you want to talk about the how E3 works is that there's no trailer reveal at any of the press conferences. There's a giant demo on Geoff Keighley's YouTube stage, just like where Telltale went to go talk about The Walking Dead: Michonne and nobody **** heard it. You know what I mean? Like nobody heard it 'cause there was so much noise, so many big events, so many pre-shows, so many post-shows that like you had to be dialed in at that one moment to get into. We watched the trailer, we did the rewind for it and we had a great time talking about it, right? But that didn't resonate to me as an E3 Game of the Show. And now granted, it's 'cause I'm spoiled. I already played it. I put two days into it. But it's not, it wasn't even on my radar in terms of E3. I",

You're, you did a trailer, you're not on the stage. You have the booth, but it's like booths aren't really what E3 is to us. You know what I mean? E3 is the stage demos, it's the press conferences, it's these different things. I was surprised, yeah, that there were, you didn't feel a presence of it. And a big part of that I think is the fact that Kojima wasn't there. You know what I mean? They didn't have him there. If things weren't south with them right now, you have to imagine he comes out on the Sony stage and talks about Metal Gear and shows a demo and does something cool to get everyone excited about it.

I'm like, well, I've said it's my game of the year so far, so I think that's a good enough nod for it. And it's just like, yeah, like I want to give it to things that caught me off guard or I didn't see coming. E3 use that excitement and that, oh, I got something brand new. And Metal Gear has been around a bit. You know what I mean? Like, let's get out there and do something. Mhm. And a lot of people called me out, uh, not called me out, but a lot of people had questions, I should say, and brought up the original tweet I did from Kojima's studio, or sorry, Konami LA Studios down there when I was playing Metal Gear, right?

And here we are E3, and did they show anything? I don't know. I didn't get a chance to watch all these things they're doing on the YouTube stage. But for us, it was one PowerPoint slide that said how many players are in a map. So I really have nothing to say 'cause I have no idea what the hell Metal Gear Solid Online's all about.

That game looks **** awesome and I can't wait to play it. So I'm glad that um, that that seemed to be like the star, one of the stars of the show, just generally, not even Nintendo. Yeah, certainly. Yeah, it was one of your games of the show. It bothered me in the Nintendo Direct how they were manhandling all those documents, but other than that, it was good. Um, here, original way we laid it out, holding and like, all right, pulling out of your pocket like, oh, by the way, there it is. All right, forgot that we got the original document. Jesus Christ, what are you guys thinking? Um, but yeah, that game looks awesome. So I I want to give a shout out to that. Uh, there were a few games that I was surprised I didn't see more about.

One of the games I was surprised that I didn't hear more about was RIGS. Oh yeah. Um, RIGS is made by Guerrilla Cambridge, so a first party Sony studio. Um, which is, it's like three on three Arena combat game for Morpheus. And I was surprised that it had like a very um, uh, noticeable and big placard on the show floor. And it was upstairs, you had to like go upstairs and play it and stuff like that. And it was, I was surprised I didn't read more about that game. Uh, I played Alienation, Housemarque's new game for PS4 behind closed doors and it's **** awesome. So I can't wait to play that. Um, but I didn't really see anyone talking about that. I think mostly because it wasn't on the floor and it was in like pre-alpha and it was a little rough, but",

Rocket League didn't see nearly enough Rocket League. Gave Rocket League one of my placards for game of the show. Uh, love that game. Can't wait to play it. Um, yeah, so I mean there was a few of those uh, out there. But actually the biggest miss for me in terms of its appearance on the floor, but not in playable form and nothing to see of it was Persona 5, which is why I think that it's not coming out this year. I don't care what they say. So and let's let's bring this nugget up too, 'cause this **** driving me crazy as well. We had been saying for a while like, don't expect it in 2015, don't expect it in 2015 in North America. And so then some kid had tweeted me like, hey, what what do you think the chances are?

And they put out a statement of it is coming in 2015. And everybody's tweeting at me saying I'm wrong. January 1st, 2016, everybody take a **** photo of how many hours you back on one of the the little wind up cameras. I want a photo of your screen showing your game time in Persona 5 'cause it will be zero hours, zero minutes. Like I understand that it's, there's a light for in the end of the tunnel here that all of a sudden the website says 2015, Atlus says 2015. I'm sure they're aiming for 2015. I'm telling you they won't hit 2015 in North America. Take it to the bank. Boom. I won't, I won't be quite that confident. Anything can happen. Fired up. I I still I",

It looks great, but I mean it's not Hands-On or whatever. And I still think their primary market is not the West, so they don't, you know, I think there's, you know, John Hardin, who's our friend over Atlus, who does all their PR, did reiterate that they think it's going to come out in 2015. But I just, I just don't see it happening. But I hope it's true. Actually, GS, they come out and they're like, look at this huge thing, release date worldwide. And I'll be like, oh man, Humble Pie. And I'll eat it up. But I just only being told I'm wrong when you don't have a confirmation. The website saying 2015 is not being in your hands. Yeah.

So that, which was exactly what happened with Batman. Um, which was obvious as the day is long where they were like, Batman's coming. What what was the original date? Like November, November. And they're like, oh, never mind, we need eight more months. It's like, I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure you knew you needed those eight months, but all right, I believe you. Um, so yeah, that was actually the biggest thing that was missing on the show for me because I expected it to be there. First of all, I expected it to be at Sony's conference.

I still am confident that it comes out this year in Japan, but I just don't, you know, same thing with Tales and other another RPG series. You identify and focus on your home market first and then you worry about localizing later. The studio has enough to worry about. They have been making this game for a very long time. So you have to assume it's almost done. Yeah, but maybe not. I I I I don't know. You know, all I know is that Catherine came out in 2011. Never released anything since then.

Um, there's a ton of Tim's games that obviously for probably the right reasons didn't get enough, but uh, like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. It was weird to me how little that game was talked about in the sense of like, where was it? Again, it was the Geoff Keighley thing. The gameplay world premiere of it was on Geoff Keighley's show that no one saw. Well, not no one saw, but everyone was busy watching all these other things.

Having said that, from the little I saw, I am worried about that game. But you're Mr. Tony Hawk. I can't wait for it. It's going to be, I know it's going to be good enough. Yeah, I know that good enough. It is not going to be great. Okay, but it will be good enough. And that's exciting to me. But man, oh, it looks rough. But it does look like Tony Hawk. It just weird to me that they're like, oh, it's classic, it's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. And I'm like, then why does it have a bunch of the shitty features from THUG 2? Yeah, guys, come on. Um, then Yoshi's Woolly World. It's almost unfair to bring up because that's that game's been at E3. It feels like forever. And I've seen it so many damn times. But and it's also out in like a month.

I really connect to, you know, uh, but that game looks awesome. And I've seen a couple of the reviews go up now and it's not looking too great. No, really? I mean, it's like sevens, which and that's my problem is Yoshi's Woolly World could have been a nine. You know, it could have been like, it looks cute, but it's actually challenging. It's actually really like good. And it's not. So it's going like Kirby's Epic Yarn. It's another Yoshi game. And it's like, I love Yoshi. So it's the year of the Yoshi.

Um, I it blew me away 'cause my God, seeing a screenshot of that game, I'm like, this is made up. This looks like, this is like a dream I had.

I think E3 overall, the booths were really oddly set up this year. Like did you get too much of a chance to walk around the show floor? I walked around our show floor a fair bit. West Hall, South Hall. I just ran to like my appointment there. Like I thought that Sony's Booth, Sony and Nintendo and Microsoft, they always kind of have a similar like layout year to year overall. And they're always good. It's always like well conduced to seeing all their their offerings. The smaller Indie titles and the like different demo kiosks. Nintendo's very focused.

But then when you went over to the other Hall and it's all the different like the third party things, it was a **** **** show. It usually is over there though. But it was like more so than normal. Like Activision's Booth, it was just the Destiny Booth. Like it was just Destiny. Everything else was behind closed doors. And I was like, what?

Um, so I thought all all that was pretty interesting. But a big thing that I don't think is being talked about enough, granted not much to talk about, Kingdom Hearts III. Like we got a gameplay trailer that showed a fair amount of gameplay, a lot of new stuff. We got the new Tangled world. We saw a new Hercules place. And I'm just like, this looks **** awesome. I hate that that trailer ended and it said, what do you remember what it said? It said like, still in development or something. I'm like, **** you guys. Like, come on.

And I think it's because Square's conference happened at a weird time. And it happened the day after they announced Final Fantasy VII. Square's conference was weird to me. It was, it was totally unnecessary. Actually, I'm surprised that they actually let loose on the Final Fantasy VII thing at Sony. But I'm sure there's a deal, maybe a publishing deal or some some money being exchanged. But yeah, that was weird. Square Enix didn't need to have a conference.

Yeah, but slow your roll a little bit and finish some of the games you have in the pipeline so I don't ever have to **** look at them any E3 again. That would be like where I would start. You know, Final Fantasy XV still not convinced it'll be out by E3 next year. Kingdom Hearts, no chance in hell. You know, so get used to seeing Kingdom Hearts for the next two or three years at E3 and get used to seeing Final Fantasy VII Remake in perpetuity.

But I would not be surprised if we didn't even hear another update on that game for maybe even past next E3. Yeah, they need to go dark for a little while. And that's that's the thing that's frustrating to me about so Square's Japanese stuff is that, you know, when I saw that they were patching Final Fantasy XV's demo, I'm like, why are you patching it? Make the game. That's where they make already. They fix things that they can apply to the game, Colin, so they can see, show that they're listening to your feedback.

They, well, I loved that when they were like, they remember we we did it on Colin and Greg, I think, where it was like, here's all the feedback. And one of them, of course, was the awful voice acting. But the, it's unbearable that voice, the blonde guy voice act. I'll never get over how bad that was. If I never have to hear, I I I I suspect he will not be in the final game. Um, but I appreciate that they did that. And they're like, here's what you guys said. And here the is, here's the advice we're taking in as we continue to build the game. That's great. Good team working on a very talented team working on this game as they have been for a very long time. Uh, but I didn't expect them to update the demo. Take, pretend the demo doesn't exist and just walk away from it and go back and work on the game using the advice you got from the demo. You know, and I'm sure they're doing that as well.",

And I feel like they're updating the demo because they're like, the game's still 18 months off or something like that. You mean, yeah, yeah, it's like holiday. I'm I'm shooting holiday 2016 at this point is what they probably hope, you know. Um, so that it's just, they're just Square's just weird. They're just a weird company. I don't, I'm also shocked that they didn't release the Kingdom Hearts Collection on PS4. Didn't they announce it PS4? No, they they never announced that. Not not at E3. I'm saying they, they, no, Kingdom Hearts, they did the 1.5 HD ReMIX and 2.5. I know on PS3, on PS3. Still nothing on PS4. And it just makes too much sense to be like, here's all of it in PS4.
