I was invited up, of course , to my, uh, to Lake Tahoe to see my, my sister-in-law, my brother-in-law,'cause it was, it was the holiday weekend. Um, I'll enjoy your Memorial Day. I played a lot of Wii. I spent my, the weekend for me was editing the Kinda Funny Live Show. YouTube.com. Was that fun for you? It was extremely fun. It was also very stressful. Rendering and all that stuff. Rendering it like, it was just, there was a lot of exporting problems'cause anyone that's edited videos will know the first export is never it. Your desktop by the end will have a million files that are final, final. I really hope this works V 7 and whatever. So we got there, but as the time post, the Live Show will definitely be posted YouTube.com/KindaFunny. Yeah, and the whole show will be there in its entirety. And I'm really trying to push this. I want this to be a video. I'll tell you guys about this.",

It's at currently 1.1 million on our channel because didn't push that at all. It does, it does, it does. It pain you that Greg still holds the record for the highest grossing video on our channel? Tim doesn't care . No, doesn't give a. One day I'll shatter that. He's gonna shatter it. Challenge accepted. It'll be good. I, uh, anyway, uh, so I love going up Tahoe. I love seeing my family. Um, and it's great that they're very, very close. And specifically, I like it because we do a nice mix of like outdoor activity. We'll go, we'll walk around, we'll hike sometimes . Sometimes we'll go, you know, just out and about Tahoe'cause it's so beautiful. And then for the rest of the time, we just eat really bad food.",

No, my wife is amazing, but you know, been there, done that, so I don't even think about her that much anymore. However, there is one thing that I noticed this past time. So we watched a lot of movies and we watched a lot of bad movies, so it didn't bother me too much because again, it's more about the company, who you're with. And you love bad movies. Let's I love bad movies. So I'm gonna go off, I'm gonna list off what we watched. Okay. Black and White. Don't even know what that is. It's a Kevin Costner movie. Pok\u00e9mon game, right?

And it was like a flipper like Side Story. No, it literally is this a true story? You can go down to Florida and see Winter the dolphin that doesn't have a tail that way. They, they rescued this dolphin. It was like super depressed and it had scoliosis of the spine because it had just didn't have a tail. And they figured out that if they went, they went to like a lead, uh, prost he, prosthesis person that makes prosthetics. Prosthesis. Prosthesis. No. Um, Colin, you're supposed to correct me when I get the wrong word. Prosthetic. Maybe prosthetic. I don't know. A doctor, somebody who makes pro, pro, say Northeastern five time, five times fast.

Basically, if a dolphin can't swim, obviously it's gonna get super depressed'cause dolphins have feelings. Like they're smart, they have emotions like human beings. Yeah. So let's give robot parts. So we gave basically robot, but it, it was actually fascinating. The first one was fascinating'cause they had to do like, they had to figure out what kind of material they could use that the dolphin wouldn't freak out because they're not used to having Robo tails. Robo tails at all. And anyway, long story short is it accepted the tail and eventually became a huge like nation, National sensation. Go see about him.

What's the other group that, that covers wildlife? PETA. No, it's a government thing. Fish and Wildlife. I thought it was the Food and Drug Administration, but it's not. Doesn't matter. Anyway, the government comes in and says , look, you can't store, you can't keep a, a ma, like an animal of this like stature, um, by itself. You have to have a pair because otherwise they get super depressed and they die. And because it's a sequel. So, and because it's a sequel. So it was about finding the pair for Winter because her, her pair dies. Like the whole cast of the first movie comes back for the sequel. They got everyone back. And I'm talking everyone.

Anyway, had a lovely weekend watching all those bad movies. Um, we watched one other one and I can't remember. Oh, it was Focus with Will Smith and Margot Robbie. And I'm glad they held that movie because she was not very good in it. She's better now, but apparently they filmed that movie a while back and then she got big because of Wolf of Wall Street. So they held it and then released it. This happens a lot in Hollywood where they're like, this movie is not that good, but she's got a Martin Scorsese movie coming out, so let's hold it.

Um, but what made the movie slightly worse, and this is the topic, a long-winded sort of trail to get to my topic, was that my sister-in-law, God bless her, and she knows I love her, likes to watch everything with TrueMotion on. Oh, good Lord. And if you're not familiar, you probably have this on your TV. It's probably called something else , either Smooth Motion or TrueMotion or whatever. Basically, what this process does, and I'm probably going to slaughter this, but to the best of my knowledge, is it artificially, uh, creates new frames in the picture to make it look more like video or more like real life. Now, to the untrained eye, it makes everything look more crisp, more vibrant. It makes the motion a little bit more like a 60 frames per second, um, video or a",

No, take it off TV. It's so offensive to the point where my, my, my wife actually went to visit her friend in Atlanta, uh, who we might end up actually seeing, and she cannot, yeah, we're gonna spend the night there. She cannot watch anything without this on. And my wife's like, calls me, she's like, Mel's in the bathroom right now. How do I turn this thing off? Won't notice. And I had to walk her through turning off. And sure as Mel noticed, she was like, what happened to my TV? What did you do? Something. No,'cause I, a lot of people I know that I don't respect at all, they, um, they think that that's what HD means. Like they think that's HD. Like, oh, no , you don't have an H, this isn't an HD TV.

Yeah, so you know, for, for, for people out there that aren't as crazy about video as we are, which I'm sure there's not many of our fans probably are. I think a lot of our fans probably are, but for the, for the few people out there that don't give a about frame rate and specifically like how that's accurately portrayed from what the people who either made the movie or designed the game wanted it to be, um, this is, it's hard for me to watch something that was what they say acquired in 24 frames per second.

And that relies on a number of different things, but one of the biggest is that it's 24 frames per second. And all of us that have grown up with that technology, um, view that, see that as a film. And we're sort of lulled into that like suspense of disbelief . And where it's, it's, it's that passive experience.

Like it looks like there's everyone was on a green screen and the background is just not real. This is a problem people had with The Hobbit, right? No, it's no, it's a similar problem. Didn't they, didn't they, didn't they film it though? Filmed at 48. Yeah, so it looked whacked out. But that's different though, because so that was what was the word you just said? That was natively acquired at, that was, that was shot at 48 frames per second with two REDs. And that that was actually done specifically for the, for the 3D and the compositing in it though.

Yeah, it has to do with a lot of motion blurring. Um, but um, but the big thing is like I could be wrong and you probably know this better, but the eye only sees at 28 frames per second. So if you're doing animation it's only 28 frames in a second. I don't know actually. I meant to look that up before the show. Well, that can't be true because you can see the difference between 24 and 60. Most it that depends even in video games. Like there are some games where you can notice and the only big time you really notice in a lot of video games if if you're using a mouse you're looking very quickly for movies.

Like if you look at it if you watch the 48, oh no, it will look different, but your mind doesn't necessarily process it the way that it's supposed to. Well, I think what you're thinking is, well, and I could be wrong on this, but in order to perceive motion in images, it has to be at least 16 frames per second. That could be it. So if you drop below 16 frames per second, it looks like stop motion. It looks like stop motion or looks or your brain goes, that is a series of still pictures that are being put together. At 16 frames is when the the human brain goes, I'm watching motion, something moving. Yeah. And apparently, and I look this up, so I could be wrong, but I was from Old School Film School is that the reason we hit 24 is because during sound constraints had to in order to sync sound with video with with film, it had to be at least 24 frames.",

That's ask you how they settled on that. Yeah, so that was how they settled on 24 frames. And of course, back in the day and to this day, film stock is incredibly important. So you didn't really want to push it that extra six frames per second because you're talking about miles of film at the end of the day that cost a ton of money per per foot. So they were like, 24 is the bare minimum we could do. That's what the entire industry settled on. And that, and it's not right or wrong, by the way. There it's just we all as a group, that is what we came up knowing. That is how we perceive narrative, the high art of storytelling and film to be. So I'm not, it's not to say that 2 0 years from now or 60 years from now, because everything's digital now, it's just literally a setting our camera that we switch over that",

But for right now, I equate 60 frames per second as video, which means soap opera. And so when I'm watching Will Smith have sex with Margot Robbie in a soap opera, I'm like, this is not sexy, this is just weird. And well, a very soap opera or home movie. And I think that's the thing that's like weird about it is that it looks like it's your home videos from the 90s that like, it's real life. Like that's that really happened. So it's kind of off-putting to see Will Smith naked in real life. Was sex, uh, not hot, but just because they didn't have a lot of chemistry and Margot Robbie, it was her first film.

Not every game needs to run even anywhere near 60 frames a second to be good. So I hate that. And not every game needs to be in 1080. Yeah, a game that runs in 720 is not a poor game. It it's a matter of the visual fidelity of the game matters to a lot of people, not so much to me, but it's more about how does the game play? 60 frames as an element of gameplay matters in a twitch shooter, but it doesn't necessarily matter in a game like The Witcher that runs to 30 frames.

You know, in other words, there are certain games where it really benefits and then there are certain games where most games I would say where it doesn't matter. Constant frame rate is the most important thing. Constant 30. Yeah, locked. That's that's what's really necessary. But I'm a numbers whore. I want 1080 60 for everything.

Which is a game that purposely tries to be more cinematic. Did that add to the experience to have it be a more cinematic, uh, frame rate? You'd say the same about The Last of Us too, like the PS4 version. Yeah, the PS4 version ran a 60. You could lock it at 30 though. Yeah, I mean, I I thought The Order played fine and looked pretty.

Is that minimum 30 frames per second? Yeah, I think I think if your game's running both and that's the thing to point I'm making like sub-30 is not optimal for any game because you're and it's not so much the way the game looks because as we said, natural motion for us on a screen is usually 24 frames.

And I feel like people just like are stopping the stop like need to take games on a game-by-game basis and stop being again, we were talking about it before just about politics off camera, but so obsessed with the orthodoxy of 1080 60 that they're not like, wait a minute, Game X doesn't need to run it like the Game X looks fine at 720.

Yeah, I think Naughty Dog has even come out and said for Uncharted 4, like their goal isn't 60 frames per second. Yeah, they're like, we we'll try to do that, but it it really doesn't matter. And it's very the game looking run the best it possibly can. Yeah, and it's a beautiful game. Like it's not adding anything to it. Well, see, I would also add that for that game, it might not behoove it to run at 60 frames per second because that game does heavily, uh, revolve run a cinematic quality. Yes, it's probably more that they can't fit it into the game. Was The Order at 24? Was that what you're saying? I it was it it was going for. I don't think it was a 24. It was probably at least",

Well, you have to that's the other thing though too,'cause there's a lot of technical, uh, stuff that goes into film acquisition that doesn't go into, uh, um , uh, games specifically, depth of field and, uh, motion blur. And so a lot of they add that now. You get you get that, but it's not a staple. It doesn't behoove you to have depth of field in a game like a a third person shooter for instance, because you need to be able to see all the way down to your distance, figure out what's going on. If they had depth of field, it would be a physical impossibility to play a third person shooter because you would have to choose. They do it a lot. They do it.

That's accurate. But with film, you have, you know, the DP is choosing what you're seeing via the use of depth field. And they're also, um, inherently depending on the aperture and and your and your settings of the camera or how how you've chosen to shoot that, you can get a specific amount of motion blur in there, which actually again, has that psychological effect of like, it's it's more cinematic. It's lulling the, um, the person that's watching it into more of a passive experience. You don't get motion blur especially in first person shooters'cause you don't want that.

You're not doing it right . Fine, you can do that. You don't need you can get a crisp image out of your TV and a very saturated image out of your TV without doing the frame blending. It's really the frame blending is the only thing that really kills me. Like everything else, if you want everything you watch to look like a Michael Bay film, great, do that.

Yeah, I think and one of the points you made too is just like, what is the vision of the filmmaker? What is the vision of the game creator? And that's always the thing I B I mean with games in this whole 1080p 780 or 720 30 60 thing is like, what is the intent of doing that? You know, with a finite amount of resources, was the game going to be prettier if they did this at this frame rate? And does this make sense? In other words, there's just no answer. Yeah, if you like 60 1080, more power to you because I I I think games are probably generally prettier that way and look better that way, but it doesn't always have to be that way.

And what what Capcom was doing was making the bosses the background. And so and that's why there would be like certain so like Gamma in Mega Man 3 is the last boss, but he's just the background. And then there's like certain things that are like laid over him. So the game actually runs. And so you'll notice that you can like run through certain parts of them and like certain parts of them don't get affected by any shots or anything like that.
