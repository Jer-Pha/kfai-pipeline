We are in harmony, you and I, today. Yes, we are. We've been singing goofy songs about pooping and things. I think we're through uh the planning phase for the most part, the bulk of E3. Now we're getting excited'cause we're into the fun part where we actually just go get to do it. Is that how you feel? Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. This episode was recorded long before E3. We're going to play it off, sir. We're going to act like we... I was going to be like, \"Man, I can't believe we got home so fast for E3 and recorded this show and had it up on Patreon.com/KindaFunny.\" So, well, just Kevin at 15834, bleep out everything. I... that's not... He said we were near two and then it's like 1508, whatever. Kevin out there is packing us up, man. I'll tell you right now, E3 sure was fun. Nailed it. **** killed it. Thank you.

Nick didn't even eat the pizza. Yeah, the pizza party was something special. I had fun. Good. The Puro and Tim Gettys. I had three slices of pizza. Damn, that's all. I thought you... I thought you took three at the beginning. You never went back. Back. Interesting. I was working on **** but been working on shits. But yeah, when it happens, when the pizza party pops off, you got to get on it. Can't you can't look a pizza party horse in the mouth.

You'll have to go watch the entire show to figure out. Even then, I'd have to... It was the chat that called it. I remember what it was. Uh, it was the 55-minute rate you guys went on about backyard barbecuing and then you drew a graph that was literally, I think, years from now people will look at and go, \"Oh, that explains everything.\" That was the first time we knew the pride along Colin Moriarty was out of control.

And know as you guys all know, I hate that. Like I want my collection to be a damn collection. But what I did like is that they they standardized it. So at least all your animated films, your collection of those would you couldn't do it alphabetically. You had to do it by like by genre. And so you'd have like the Star Wars movies and then the Disney animated films that were like this big and then back to the regular size VHSs. It was rubbish. Yeah, but they deserve to marketing.

Where do you stand on because I had a couple because we forgot to take them back of the ones that open up like this, not the puffy cases, but the actual like VHS rental cases that you like and open them up. I loved those. I thought that's Blockbuster case. Yeah, but Blockbuster would take eventually just printed out like the name of the movie on it. And when they give it to you back in the day, I used to go to um I used to go to Video Wiz and they would actually have the cover on it. Oh, which would be cool.

I would spend so much time just going to Blockbuster or I forget what the other one was called near my house, but like Video Villa. That was was there was there was a Hollywood Video. I never **** with Hollywood Video. By the time they came around, I was like, \" I'm Blockbuster, ride or die.
