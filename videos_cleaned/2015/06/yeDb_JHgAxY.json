Oh so I just went two minutes and I was just kind of messing around there I didn't get any of the achievement or the the missions besides the the scores now this is a little broken so before we even really get into what what Tony Hawk's all about right this game specifically it's an HD mix of 1 and 2 and it's really heavily focused on the 2",

There we go crashed it there some money over there so money is used to update your stats okay I don't know where is the K I think it's up here no now you just are you playing this again what's up did you are you replaying this or is this a different version of what what we just did yeah uh it is oh there's there I did miss it um I'm just replaying it again the oh the same level so you play the same level in two minute runs over and over until you do all the different missions got it I got you so getting S-K-A-T-E is one Mission collecting all the the um the secret tapes and stuff there's another got it and all that so so yeah I just got did I get all the S -K-A-T-E I think I just did you did get S-K-A-T-E yeah Okay",

PS1, I think. What was on PS2? PS2 had Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Tony Hawk's Underground, and Tony Hawk's Underground 2, okay, and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland wow so he things got a little crazy but there's only been four Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games. Pro Skater 5 was just announced got it so it's pretty exciting and then there's this one too oh God now I'm stuck so here's the manual get that guy you hit up down and you get this balance meter going up right mhm and then or you can hit down up and you do a nose manual so what is very important",
