But with Nintendo it's like I feel like there's just an expectation with Nintendo where people expect to see F-Zero announced and expect to see Metroid Prime and expect to see all these things and it's like in a lot of ways it's like yeah why aren't we getting them but at the same time it's like I don't know Nintendo has its directs all year and then when they have their one direct it is competing against the others so that's why it it gets confused. Nintendo's marching to their own beat and I think it's to Colin's point that yeah they're prepping for NX right so you can't put everything out.

Well but they're focusing on it now like now that's clear though when you look at this at the direct and when you see the the show floor and you you look around and see the games it's like oh these games are all coming this year as far as I know.
