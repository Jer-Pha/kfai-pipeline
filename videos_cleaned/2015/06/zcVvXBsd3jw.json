He's getting ready to be, he's getting ready to shuffle the mortal coil. I think he's just chilling. Love that saying so much. Yeah, it's good, right? It is, it's really good. Colin, the one thing I know about you is that you love spice, spice, spice, and you're super excited for this new Matt Damon flick, The Martian. I like the book, but yeah, the movie looks great. You're going to see the movie opening day, opening, opening show. Oh my God, oh my God. So we're going to play, oh, it's there. I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it. Everybody, we're having, now you have to make the volume, you made the volume nine, but you have to make it either 10 or eight,'cause I don't like odd numbers. There you go, that's better.

It's a planet, or it could be a comet, or an asteroid, or a moon. No, we're going, we're going to say planetoid. There it is. That's a planet. It looks like a planet to me. So here we go. How much of, how much do you know about Lifeless Planet? Nothing. It's a puzzle game. Okay. It didn't score, you know, I'm not very good at puzzle games. That's like my one weakness, like my Achilles. Figure out, we're not going to play forever. We're going to get deep into it. The first puzzle is going to be like, hey, can this circle piece fit in this circle hole? Oh, you'll be surprised. It did. Whoa, space. All right, the landing site. Now let's see here. There's an American flag, a German flag, a Japanese flag. Looks like a UN flag. UNICEF flag. UNICEF flag. No. So you've landed here on this planet, perhaps",

He's good. The sound of my breath puffing in my helmet is hollow and distant. It's hard to tell how long I've been unconscious, and I'm worried that I might have a concussion. I wish I could lay back down and rest, see if the pain passes, but the situation is far too critical, far too critical. To call that a hard landing would be kind. We crashed, damn it. Maybe the Eggheads miscalculated the trajectory, or maybe we just had a spell of bad luck. Whatever the case may be, this is not the paradise they described to us back home. There is no lush greenery, there is no sign of life at all. And where is my crew? I hope they're just securing a perimeter and that I was out",

And I don't care how, I don't care how, if you're running out of air , you might not be writing a log at all. You might want to figure things out all that first. Just get right to, oh, there's another crater there, Colin. What's in the center of it? We know how craters are formed, don't we? We do. Stuff in the center of them. That's exactly right. Kind of like a jelly donut. Jelly donuts are formed similar. So what do I do? This is it . We're in the first puzzle. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Tim Schafer probably designed this game.

Well, you're writing these as you go. No, yeah. All right. Oh, sh. Good job, man. Thanks. So you can't hold it, right? You got to, you're just tapping. Yeah, that's all it does .

Maybe we just dropped in the wrong spot, but initial readings aren't coming up with any trace of biological activity. Do you think it's that traveling at twice the speed of light, they went into the future and so this, the planet now is like, there is no gre, there's greenery up there. Oh dear, oh dear. Or no, those might just be written things from an alien. I need to get up there some. Use your hands. Just grab it. Why won't you grab it? I hate games like that when that happens. There's water, so there's plenty of life here. Take off your helmet. I don't know if that's a safe move. We all saw the movie The Abyss, Nick. Remember The Abyss? Sure do, Greg.
