We're trying out something new. If you've listened to the GameOverGreggy Show that would be going up at the same time for Patreon people as this show, you know that we were debating the best way to seat Portillo at the table because I get pushed off the mic when he's in my lap. So we're doing this, but of course Portillo thinks this means he's getting a BarkBox. Oh, so we got to we got we him off. There was another option that I don't know if you considered, and this is a this is a this is a kind of one of those crazy options, which is that maybe the dog doesn't need to be in the room.

In fact, this was maybe the more complicated and unnecessary of all of the solutions. Let put his bed on the table. I'm just saying we're trying something out. We to see how it is. Nick sits uncomfortably sometimes too on the GameOverGreggy Show. We just going to like, are we okay? Are we going to bring the toilet into the room for Nick? Is he just going to sit on the toilet? We probably should. That would be that that would be good. Production would go up for sure. Oh, look at him.

Kinda Funny Gamescast, let's show where we talk about video games. And what we do is we break it up topic by topic every day, Monday through Thursday over on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. Full episode goes up on Friday. You can get it early Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames. But what's interesting about this is E3 is like two weeks out from now, but how we're recording it now, we're going to be making predictions and stuff, and it's going to be a little thrown off because when people are listening to this, no matter when they're listening to it, even if it's early, usually the show isn't as topical.

So I'm just letting the people know, not that it matters because we're just kind of **** talk. For the record, we recorded this on Tuesday, June 2nd, 4:39, yeah, Pacific Daylight Time. Sure. Yeah, right. Is there a difference between daylight and standard? Yes, yes, PDT and PST. The ****. That's why you say PT. You don't put we're not PST.

So doing something more like, I don't know, maybe the 1th episode where we didn't do the mailbag grab bag. Yeah, we're just going to have four topics that are our own topics. First topic is going to be Sony predictions for their press conference. Second topic will be Microsoft, then Nintendo, then third parties. It's going to be fun.

Yeah, I'm just going to I have a bunch of games and we'll bring them up and see what you guys think of whether or not they'll be there.

That's not the way that's not the way the tradition was. I don't care. There's a new tradition here. Okay, I guess my only prediction is next year will be the year of the Yoshi. It's finally happening. All the companies are just going to give in and they're just going to build a shrine for Yoshi and all games are going to St. Yoshi.

There's also a whole bunch of other ways that people can watch. I think there's more live streams going on this year for E3 than there ever has been.

Did you go off of like research or what did you do? I just went with my bosss. Okay, best way to go. What's your next one? First one, whatever. Do you not does everybody think that's not going to happen? I think there it's I don't think that will happen.

Maybe they give you a date, a window. The Last Guardian is re-revealed for PlayStation 4. They show a new trailer for it with a release date this fall. Whoa. Okay, so when you say trailer, MH, are we getting gameplay or is it some CG ****? Probably both. Okay, the game's been in development. Sony swears up and down has for years that the game is in development and being worked on actively at Japan Studio. Uh now is the time. The game will be shown at E3.

And therefore no more gap on. See, understand that they have nothing to gain by teasing this game again. They have to just show it and release it, right? And so it'll either be at E3 or Gamescom. But I do that that game's coming out soon this year. Yeah, I think that's the more shocking thing. They don't gain anything by by playing, you know, by playing around with it anymore. Like when it's when when it's going to be shown, it's it's imminent, you know, because like the game just needs to come out now. But I do believe it's real and I believe it will come out.

So sure, that's what I think it's going to be. Okay, my next prediction comes from col G live, but we're putting it into the official box here of what's happening at E3. Morpheus gets more than 15 minutes of stage time. I'm going to sit there and talk about Project Morpheus and try to sell you on Project Morpheus and it's not going to go well. The wrong way. I enjoy calling. I enjoy calling a lot. I'm glad somebody does. Project Morpheus will be discussed for 0 minutes or less. Oo, well, was it 0, 15 or 0? I'm saying 0. You can say whatever you want. Well, no, we had an official from the show. I thought I thought it was 15. We settled on. Did you go? I'm going up to 0. Okay, so",

I'm going up to 0. Okay, so both of us can possibly be right about this. Interesting, interesting. Morpheus will be discussed for only 0 minutes or less. The primary reason I think this is because the games cannot be effectively shown, but I think that there will be connectivity with games that you don't expect as one of my predictions will reveal. But it's hard it's hard to show VR on a stage like that. And I think they're smart enough to not do it for very long. See, I think they're going to have a way to do it. I just think they won't. I mean, it'll just be first person shooting looking. I really hope that it it like falls in like that five minutes to make Colin right and you wrong. Why why? I know been fun.

Yeah, th thus signifying it's it's over. Damn, I think that's true. Sounds like a weird MSRP. $89.99 is what I'm saying. That's the rumor, a rumor for a while. Yeah, I'm I'm saying I believe it. Okay, it's a legacy system if you didn't hear. Yes, yes. I'm not going to identify cost, but I'll say that both PlayStation 4 and Vita get price drops. Um no real need to drop PlayStation 4's price. Um this of course will affect uh PlayStation 4 or Sony in negative ways in terms of money loss. $50 per console over millions of consoles. But there's something that tells me it's time.

Um if Sony can do it, even if they drop it to 379 or something like that, um that's just a way to get more people in the store and more people interested in it because obviously Xbox One is cheaper. Um and you have to play that game eventually. It doesn't make a lot of financial sense. I'm not 100% confident in that prediction. Uh but I think that PlayStation 4 and Vita will both get price cuts. And I I would say if I was going to guess what it would be, it would be something like $119.99 for Vita and and $349.99 for PS4. Okay, yeah. Okay, I'd be shocked if to be to under 100.

It's confirmed that is the PS4 that stays at the current price. The 500 one gets a price drop. We introduced the old two skew console again. I don't like this.

They can't tether that game success to Morpheus, but they can work Morpheus and Move into it if you want to use it. But otherwise, it's a game you can play without it using this DualShock 4. I think that that is probably the reason why the game has taken so long, cuz Media Molecule has been quiet for a very long time. They haven't put out understand their core team has not put out a game since 2011. So it's it, you know, they've released Tearaway, but that team was about 1 to 15 people.

So I do think that but I mean but that's the whole thing of what I still just don't believe in Morpheus and don't trust in. And they can't do that. They can't give you the out because if they give you the out, they don't buy the Morpheus and then it's just over and over and over again. Not to mention it's going to be like Resistance where it's going to be like, oh, the Resistance, the Move game. It's like, no, it's not. It's not a Move game.",
