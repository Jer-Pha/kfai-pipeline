That's what I'm doing right now, just making sure. My Nintendo predictions begin with the announcement that Nintendo has made a with amazon.com and Nintendo products will be sold on amazon.com normally and not all **** up through third party Sellers and everything's going to be okay. You're dreaming, buddy. What? I don't really know anything about this. Can you can you explain this to me? Sure, if you've never tried to order something Nintendo related off Amazon, you cannot. Why? Cuz they don't get along. Why? I don't I don't know if there's ever been hisorical reason has this happened? It's been going on since probably the late Wii era. I kind of vaguely remember this. I'm going to look it up for you. Okay, it's an issue. My first Nintendo prediction is that Star Fox opens the show is fully well they're going to do a Nintendo",

My first Nintendo prediction is that Star Fox opens the show is fully well they're going to do a Nintendo Direct, but we're going to just refer to it as a conference. Uh, Star Fox is the first thing shown. Um, they show it in an intensive look at it and it's dated for this fall. Oh god. Um, I'm so excited. They have to get that game out. You know, like that that game is basically the only thing between it and Zelda of any consequence and I don't mean that as a disrespectful thing cuz I'm most excited about Mario, but the fact of the matter is unless they have a big mey first party announcement which they don't because if they're smart they're moving all their resources to their next console. Um, Star Fox is too far along to move and so I think that um that is a safe assumption. I'm so excited for that that might be the thing that I'm looking forward to most is I just want to see it and like that's one of",

We see I don't want to see no on football **** no on foot **** I like that I like the on foot stuff in Star Fox Adventure personally on GameCube. Okay, but assault was that the second the one where there was it was like not majority it was about a third flying oh so you're saying I see what you're saying so a mixture kind of like um like uh the Star Wars game on N64 where you sh and was a disaster Rog we're getting now I'm talking about Shadow the Shadows of the Empire game okay my apolog uh first reference to Nintendo and Amazon's Rift comes from uh our good friend Jason Shrier over at Kotaku on September",

My next prediction for Nintendo, Nintendogs returns. Okay, thank you. That's interesting. I mean they would they would and they will. My second prediction is that Wii U gets a significant price drop to the tune of maybe 40%. Damn my God Wii U is dying yeah and there's no reason for them to not drop the price significantly so this isn't going to be a a token like oh well you know $50 off like no like maybe plus if you know more uh off of the price of Wii U my Lord Wii U is not even a",

Zelda Wii U gets a release date of summer  016 on Wii U yep fair enough I can see that happening uh they spend a significant amount of time showing multiple Smash Brothers DLC characters amongst them will be the Ice Climbers yeah con's heavy see that's I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do with smash because I'm assuming we'll see Lucas a little bit like actually see him like gameplay",

Um, I climbers I think that's a safe assumption that like there's a good chance it'll be there. I'm really more interested in seeing something like uh well either a new character like a fully new character that hasn't been in Smash because I don't want to see them just continuously go down this path of yeah something like that would be awesome but I can see them just kind of like putting out the the remaining characters that haven't been brought back which is fine I want that to happen too but I don't like that Lucas is the and like it was Mewtwo and then Lucas it's like I want those to be like alongside something new dryon you know and I feel like they're I",
