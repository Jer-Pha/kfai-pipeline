Now, now I'm very last time. I'm very excited about this, Nick, because while we were at E3, Nintendo announced the damn bombshell. Oh, they dropped it on us. DLC pack introducing my boy Ryu and of course my boy Roy from Super Smash Bros. Melee, also known from this game called Fire Emblem, but whatever. I know him from Smash Bros. Melee, also in Fire Emblem 7, not my favorite of the Fire Emblem games. He was my main character in Melee. Uh, Roy. Roy. Interesting. See, I never played Melee. That was my problem. Uh, now I need to go, uh, J up my character here. We pop out and do that. Yeah, yeah, we can do that. Cool. So as your, this is my Wii U. You've ever played on Wii that I'm normally used to playing. These are not the droids. These are not you're looking for. All right, so, so Nick, um, here you go. You go up to the controls. I let you do this . So for everybody out there",

But I wish that you can get to this menu from the character select screen when you make your name because everybody wants to turn off the Jump tap and everyone wants to like change something. Test this real quick. That's not right. See, I always screw this up because you got to do it playing. Hold on. I think that should be jumping. This should be grab. Yeah, that's right. All right, cool. Save. No, what's going on? So I'm really excited about this because uh, I haven't been able to play yet as Ryu or Roy. I downloaded this last night. There's a whole bunch of like Mii Fighter. Are you starting with Roy? So let's just, I'll do Roy and you. Yeah, just me and you. I don't think we've ever",

No, and I doubt this will be a real one-on-one match either as I, oh, it's, it's going to be a real one-on-one like cleanup. I like how you have your full name in there just in case there's another Tim. People need to know straight up what's wrong. Back in Melee, he had a blue costume with blue hair. Obviously, they got rid of that'cause now there's 10 million blue-haired Fire Emblem characters. Yeah, there's one, there's Marth, there's Ike. I'm going to go this. There's this chick, Lucina, right? All right, cool. Let's, let's get it in. Let's get it in. Sounds like junior high. All right, we're going to my level, little hometown Suzaku Castle. Never knew it was called that. Oh, it's Ryu's stage as far as, hey, there you go. It even says it. So, so much easier to do that now. So, Nick, just so you know, if you input",

It's stronger than if you just hit the, oh, that's cool. Well, if I just hit, that's dope . That's takes some getting used to though because you're not used to normally used to actually having to do that. I, you don't have to though. That's just going to be, you know, the Advanced Techniques. Oh, that was dope. That's awesome that they actually got Ryu for this. Yeah, it really is. That nice Capcom partnership is, uh, I'm very excited about it because it shows that this is our first new character that we've gotten for DLC'cause we've got Mewtwo.

He still, still is, but uh, in Melee, oh God, oh, in Melee, he, uh, he was way slower, but he was more powerful and, uh, his sword did more damage if you hit it in the middle of the sword. Marth was the tip. Um, I'm not sure if that's still how it is in this game. I'm going to assume, but because this game is a lot slower than Melee, I don't think that Roy's at such a disadvantage with the speed. That kick sucks. Oh, this counter is still pretty. Yeah, I know your counter is whatever it is. Good for your counter. Oh, no, no, no. Think it's the same voice too. Are we going to get Ken ever? No. Okay,'cause part of me always likes Ken.

And I mean, you know, Ryu has a pretty standard move set when it comes to anything like all the different games, but his design, I mean, I don't know, I'm not that an expert when it comes to Street Fighter, but I'm getting hints of 3. Uh, yeah, I wouldn't be able to tell it. You be told. I mean, it's got that, I mean, 3 is an like a, is it, was 3 the first time they started doing the the cel-shaded style? No, was pixel.

Smash is the business. Oh God, I actually think I'd like Street Fighter a lot more if, if it was , if played like Smash. Oh God. Oh yeah, you can tell Ryu is going to be a combo character. Oh yeah. Yes. I can't wait to see like pros play as in, you're saying I'm not doing a great job. Oh damn. Oh, got you the middle. God, that's, that strike is not good. Oh God, I effed that up. Oh, no, no, no.

Yeah, I never thought I'd see Roy and Ike in the same Smash Bros. game. It's crazy. Well, you know, luckily the Wii U has the power to have more than 30 characters on as a select screen. Barely though, right? But no, the characters, I'm just joking. They should be doing this forever. I love the doing this and I love that there's not an end in sight. He, why play is weird. He's not as fast as Marth. Well, no, he's, he's way slower. He's more like Ike. Yeah, he was the Ike of the Melee . J, there it is. See, you got that. That was dirty. That one hit twice.
