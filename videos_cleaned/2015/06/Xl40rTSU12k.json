I can't wait. Question is, twist his mind, how do you bring up butt stuff? Oh, uh, delicately, uh, and with a lot of care, and uh, slowly. No, in all seriousness, what I would do is if like anything in your relationship that you want to talk about, any broo, any any anything you want sexually, talk openly and honestly. The best way to bring up butt stuff is to actually bring up butt stuff. Yeah, you say, you say, you look at your significant other , you say,'I want to talk to you about something, and I'm serious about this. Look, look at me when you do it. I would like to talk to you about butt stuff.'Mhm. You should probably shouldn't say that though. Not that right. Hey,'I have a sexual need that I would like you to fulfill if you are comfortable with it.'We're getting somewhere. I think the best way, but don't say,'What are your thoughts on anal?'Yeah.",

I think the best way, but don't say,'What are your thoughts on anal?'Yeah, don't do that. So you're sitting there talking about, you're like,'What are your thoughts on anal?'I think a good way to bring it up is to start talking about sex stuff, sure, general sex stuff, and have that conversation of,'Oh, is there anything that like you want to try?'Yeah, because that puts it on them, you know? Then you can have that open conversation of,'Oh, I'm kind of interested in this or this or that,'or'I'm not interested in that.'That gives you your first red flag. Or you could just uh, ask Two Dudes the question, have them make a video about it, and then tweet it at your girlfriend. Friend, you should do that because I'm sure she'll like that a lot. The most important thing about all of this, whether it's Love or Sex Stuff, is consent. Consent. You need to, you need to make sure she is okay with it and into",

You need to, you need to make sure she is okay with it and into it. If your partner wants you to do something that you're not quite comfortable with, but you're open to the idea, like maybe it's not your thing, but you're like,'You know what, he or she wants it, let's give it a shot.'Give it a shot. Do it, do it with, you know, be careful, be safe, be sane. Don't be drunk when you're doing it. Don't be on any illicit substances when you're doing it. Here's what you don't do: don't just try it out of the blue. Yeah, okay, that is the worst thing. That's the worst thing you could do. As with everything in life that pertains to a significant other, you want them to be okay with what you're doing, so you can't just spring it on them. You can't just like they're they're getting dressed and you're in the closet in full ninja garb and then boom, you spring anal on them. You can't do",

It's not, it's not that the the idea of thinking like,'Oh, I'm just, I accidentally slipped it in.'That's not cute. That's not like a real thing. That is not a good thing. No, for a lot of people, the only reason they're into it is like domination thing, which is fine if that's your thing, you know what I mean? No, maybe yes or no. I think for for guys, like, we just want to put our penises anywhere we possibly can. Um, but I think it's more about we want to put our penises where we can't. That's true. That's true. Um, I think that is, I think for a lot of guys, that the idea of of uh, anal sex is is it's taboo. We all want it, you're right, because we can't have it, right? Uh, but at the same time, also, guys, just know that she's probably not going to want to do this. Do not pressure her. If you want to talk to her, talk",

If you want to talk to her, talk openly and honestly about it. There's nothing weird about it. It's not a bad thing. There's a lot of girls that are totally into it, and if you're into it, support that, be open. And you should also confront and let your guy know,'Hey, I like this, like, let's try this.'Tim, there's a flip side of this coin though. Mm, uh, which is that what if he's actually more interested in asking her to play with his anus? I mean, there's always a back door to every question, and sometimes it feels right and sometimes it feels wrong, and that's really up to you, you know? Just ask. That's the best thing, the best thing to do. Don't be wrong with it too. That's the most important part. Sex is weird. Sex, even normal sex, isn't normal. It's really, really weird.

And you know, if you're dating someone who wants to talk about something weird, or if you think it's weird, be open to it,'cause you know what, people have a lot of weird stuff going on in that noggin, right? Maybe they want you to just hit them in the ass as hard as humanely possible, but not look them in the eye when you're doing it.
