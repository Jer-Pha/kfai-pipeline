Honorable mention to 3DS, but none of the actual picks. Yoshi's Island. I will stand by that being one of the best, most creative 2D Platformers of all time. You're going to put that above any of the okay, but above other Mario games? I mean, it's hard because they're different, but this is I'm not saying it's better. It's I just prefer it. It's my favorite. Okay. It's your jam because Mario 3, Mario World, my God, it hurts me to not put these on these on this list. But when I'm only saying five, I feel like I would choose Yoshi's Island over over those. Okay. Yeah. And you know, I've explained many times why. We did a Let's Play on it.

And I feel like a lot of people didn't it's ignored for sure. And I feel like a lot of people don't give it actually a chance. Okay. Cause then I think that it was that the end of the Super Nintendo era when everyone was kind of moving on and everyone had already seen Mario World and it had the Mario World name in it, which pissed people off because they're like, this isn't Mario World 2. And it's not. It's really not. If they just called it Yoshi's Island, I think it would have got a a better rep. But you know what was I'm down for it. It was the first game I ever beat.

Now, another thing that I think is easy to say is Super Smash Bros. What's harder? My Melee? I Brawl on my list. Melee is the one that everybody would love to say and every it's everyone's favorite and like it's more competitive and and all that stuff. And I have amazing memories playing Melee. That was uh the first GameCube game that I had. I had the GameCube before it came out because it was came out two weeks later, which I'll never understand. But I remember just sitting there with the GameCube waiting to play this game, holding the controller, imagining playing Smash Bros.

And then for Melee to come and just blow it out, 25 characters. It's like, Melee was, well, I never played Melee. That I mean, you missed out. I know. I had a bunch of friends that did and it was one of again, it was one of those experiences where they had been playing for like three or four months before I got my hands on the controller and then it was done. I was like, I can't win this game. These guys are kicking the ass out of me. I mean, Melee really took Smash to another level. Like it took it to be hyper competitive.

But like Melee really kind of took it to that next level. Oh, this is actually this is deep. There is a fighting game in here. Um, and it caused so much controversy. Is it a fighting game? Is it not? The fact that he even had that conversation says something about that game, you know? And everyone everyone that had a GameCube had that game. Everyone loved it. Everybody had their main character they played and all these like different stories and stuff. But then Brawl happened and a lot of the Melee lovers didn't like Brawl too much.

I still say in my opinion that having spent a lot of time now with the Wii U one, that the games just get better. I actually feel like the Wii U one might be my favorite one because it has a huge roster and it's fucking awesome. It has like all these stages and I think it's great. I think the games just get progressively better. I never I loved Melee when the N64 when I liked I I I I remember playing it and having a good time with it. Not it was like fine. It was I felt like the roster was a little limited. Melee was really special. I remember too, I got my GameCube, you know, day one. I think I got like Luigi's Mansion or something.

So I think it was just Luigi's Mansion and then yeah, I got got Smash when it came out and I was like, this is really a special game. But when I got Brawl on Wii, I was like, this game's clearly better than Melee. Like I don't understand like like maybe not on a fundamental like, you know, nuts and bolts thing if you're like really competitive with the game. But I was like, I don't understand how this game isn't better than Melee. And now I'm playing the Wii U one and I'm like, I don't understand how this isn't better than Brawl. Yeah, and I mean, I agree with you in that sense of like, I do now like the Wii U one better than Brawl. It's just Brawl is my favorite because of time and place entirely.

But then when Brawl came out, it was kind of like this really nice like cross-generational thing of it was his friends, my friends, like all these different people playing this game because we'd grown up with 64, we'd grown up with Melee and Brawl was kind of just that like next level thing of just we're going to adults, all of us adults, let's play this game. And man, we would just get so into it. And it's like none of us were good to the point of being able to say, oh, I like Melee better because it's faster and all that stuff.

The wave dashing doesn't make sense to us and like all the like we don't give a shit about the frames of attacks. Like we don't understand that. We just know I like you like using Link. You have a couple combos you do. You know what I mean? Like you have these things, but you have so much fun doing it. And you can play against a pro or an idiot and still have fun doing it. I think that's something special about Smash Bros. Cause it's not playing Street Fighter against the pro. Sure. Good point. That's good. Not um, but then with the Wii U one, it's like I could never put that down as my favorite just because I put countless hours into Brawl, whether it was me and my friends, me and my little brother's friends are coming to IGN and Brawl was like the freaking bee's knees, man, years after its release.",

We unlocked all the characters at first because we had the Japanese version. And so we had unlocked all the characters on one specific version. I think it was Mark Ryan's uh uh Japanese. And then he had he had it on his Wii. Um, and it somehow got lost in the transition from the old office to the new office. And then we found it. And then it it it's it got lost. And I remember like being almost heartbroken. We had to go back and play through and unlock all the characters. And then Mark Ryan's like, dude, I'll do that in like half a day. It's not big deal.

And I would be like, I would go over to Pereira and be like, Pereira, it's I would actually send him notes or IMs or I would take pictures of shines that just say challenge question mark and just send them to him.

Um, but Brawl really is a time and a place and it's probably one of the games that I've played most in my entire life. If you actually count the hours, it probably is the longest I've ever played a game. And it's absurd that that game was that old and we were still playing it. But it's fun. Yeah, I mean, Smash Bros. in general, it nails the one more match mentality where it's just like, all right, we'll just do one more. We'll just do one more.

We're playing Smash Bros. I'm like, all right, let's do it. I go to his house with Alfredo. We just start playing. And then all of a sudden, he's, should I call Pereira? He calls Mike Pereira.

I know how to I know if I'm having a good match if I can beat one of you guys or not or if it's just time to just relax, who gives a shit and have fun and choose another character and do what they got to do.

Yeah, uh component component, excuse me. And so we ended up playing on a 32-inch monitor. That's why you invited us over is because he had this brand new TV.

It would give you live stock trades, game cheats, jokes, weather forecasts, horse betting and a small amount and a small amount of downloadable content. I knew that that existed. I tell you what, I got the names wrong when I was a kid. When I was seven, eight, I really was like, I need an all for my horse betting. If I can't bet on the horses right now, bet on the ponies. They called it. Yeah, that's true. I called the ponies back then. All right. I'm sorry. Interrupted. The next game is no surprise. It is a Pok\u00e9mon game. I've said this before. It's not Snap. It is Gen. You don't listen to Tim closely enough. Gold, Gold and Silver. Pok\u00e9mon Snap. I like Pok\u00e9mon Snap too, but it's definitely not the best game of all time.

Fast & Furious One is better than the the new ones. They'd be right. No, they they would be totally would be correct. No, they wouldn't. It's just like just because it's the first doesn't make it the best. Super Mario Bros. 1 is amazing. It is not better than 3. It is not better than World. Like that's not even you can't say that. Does it get points for being the first? It does. You got to give it the credit. But it's like anybody that says Super Mario Bros. is their favorite game, like I question that.
