I'm Colin , this is Tim, and today we're playing Devil May Cry 4 , but not the original Devil May Cry 4, Devil May Cry 4 special edition. We're playing on on Xbox One, but it's also available on PlayStation 4 and PC. Uh, and now Tim, yes, were you a fan of Devil May Cry 4 when it came out? It came out in 2008, PS3, Xbox 360, PC. I was not. You weren't? It was pretty well regarded if I remember correctly. Uh, it got in low eights and on Meta Critic and so I, I which is better than say Devil May Cry 2. Well, that's the thing, yeah. So one came out and everyone loved one cuz it was awesome. And then two came out and was one of the worst things. It was the equivalent of the Star Wars prequels to the Video Game World. Okay, it was very upsetting, very, very, very upsetting. And then three came out, what am I even doing here? Let's see, devil Hunter is the difficulty. I think whatever we're going devil Hunter automatic, whatever tutorial, let's go on. All right, so two",

I think whatever we're going devil Hunter automatic, whatever tutorial, let's go on. All right , so two comes out utter trash, then three comes out a couple years later, changes the game, comes back, brings it back to the goodness of one, but expands on it. Three is probably fans favorite of the series. I also didn't play that. I loved one, two just turned me off so much and you didn't play three, but then you jumped him back in with four. I did not. I so this is your first time. So probably smart that we're going to play the tutorial then. Uh, so for people that don't know, this is basically just being re-released on the new gen consoles. Um, you know, some HD, well was already an HD, but a nice little loss over maybe to improve frame rate, improve aesthetic, whatever. Obviously the game at this point is seven years old, so it's going to look a little bit older espe crazy yeah to think about cuz I remember when this",

So uh it seems like Capcom's just Capcom realizes as they've said earlier in the year that they're getting a lot of play on their HD re-releases Resident Evil HD remake remake for instance did over a million units digitally. So they're making a lot of money. They just announced Resident Evil Zero is now coming out again um which is of course a classic GameCube game.
