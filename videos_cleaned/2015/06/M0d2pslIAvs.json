      "text": "do I have to use it Nick? Yeah, today we got a question from a 30-year-old named Greg. Greg, but it's not our Greg . No, it's probably Greg. It's not, it's not, it's a different Greg. I guarantee it's our Greg. He has a hot mail email. It's not our Greg. It's definitely our Greg. I don't know, but anyway, he has a very, very, very verbose question. Okay, like one of those long ones. I'll settle in. Hold on, let me get comfortable on this amazing log that here we go. Or DP put on Lube. That's it. That's it. That's the end of the question. Lube and a question mark. Lube is one of those things that you should get acquainted with. Uh, and there's two types. There's water-based Lube and there's silicone based Lube. Uh, some people don't have a good reaction to silicone, so that's why there is water-based. Problem with water base is it tends to dry up a little quickly and then becomes kind of sticky. So, uh, I usually start with the silicone base Loop and then if you like it and she likes it, stick with the silicone come basally. Okay.",

So, uh, I usually start with the silicone base Loop and then if you like it and she likes it, stick with the silicone come basally. Okay. Um, have you ever had a need for it yet? So here's my thing. So I remember when I first met you about five years ago, yeah, you gave me a lot of advice right off. So great, great, uh, advice to from a person who's a senior manager to an intern. Yes, advice number one was have sex with anything that moves. Okay, advice, good advice. Advice number two, don't shit where you eat, yo. So don't, which directly goes against advice number one, but just don't have sex with co-workers. Advice number three, always use a condom, always. And advice number four, always use Loop. You they sell little packets of it. Okay, if you think you're going to go out and have a good time and be safe and and contentual sex, uh, just have that as a backup because you know what, you can't always rely on your machismo to keep things lubricated.

That's the part that really interests me about this, Nick, like your advice, you're telling me all this stuff. I'm like, have sex with that moves, not my thing, but I get that at least try. You didn't say, you didn't say have sex anything moves. You said try to have sex with anything that moves. No, I said, which is a difference. Okay, differ there my least intelligent piece of advice that I gave you, but again, it's all about the game. It's about trying and seeing what's out there. Yes, what I meant by that was don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Exactly. And that that's what I did take said it by I wanted to truncate that by just saying exactly, but that's how I took it. That's how I took it and I I've listened to all this advice, but when you get to the Lube part, I was like, really? Yeah, cuz to me, I've never needed",

Yeah, cuz to me, I've never needed it, right? Anytime I've used it has just been, you know, for butt stuff. Wow, you've been fortunate. Uh , there are some pe there are some women specifically that have difficulty in that area, right? They just don't produce enough lubrication on their own and they need a little help with it and there's nothing wrong with it. Let me tell you, once you go down that road, that beautiful slippery Rose, you're not going to go back, man. I've heard some horror stories about L. Why? Like one of our good friends, he overdid the Lop. There was just too much Lu. Oh, well, that's D over. You got to be careful with Lube in the shower or anything that is a smooth surface because once the lube gets all over everything, you're gone your back or well let assuming you didn't start on your back or your or her back in the shower.

So well often times a lot of women especially if they're younger or inexperienced with sex won't tell you that they need that or they don't even know they need that. I feel I feel like with young people specifically it's kind of like a I don't need that like no I'm young and like when you were first selling me I was like you're what are you kidding me like how like that's not the problem if you're having sex they're fine like the women is fine I but it's like that you taught me something I was like I should not assume that don't assume it you know don't assume it and also especially if you're wearing a condom which you always should be cuz otherwise you're violating Nick Scarpino's rule number three mhm always we condom practice safe sex contentual sex especially if you're wearing a condom though uh",
