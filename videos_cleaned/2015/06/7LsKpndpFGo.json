      "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome back to Kinda Funny games. My name is Cardi , this is the illustrious Nick Scarpino. Nick, yo, a game just dropped on PlayStation 4 in the Pixel Junk series. The celebrated Pixel Junk series, its name is Nom Nom Galaxy, N-O-M N-O-M Galaxy, and I wanted to play it with you to see what you think of it. Uh, so far I'm loving it because this, this beat is hot . It is, it is a hot beat, there's no doubt about it. Now the Pixel Junk Series has been going on for a long time. It is basically PlayStation PlayStation Centric. The beauty is is that Q Games, the developer, always makes eight different Gam, none of the Pixel Junk games with the exceptions of the direct sequels like Shooter for instance, are ever the same as any other game sense and I think that's pretty cool. Pixel Junk of course didn't make this game by themselves though, they did it with, uh, well Q, uh, I'm sorry, Q Games rather as a developer, Japanese developer, uh, that makes the Pixel Junk games, but they did it with Double 11, which is a, I",

So usually we try to get deeper into a game before I show it to you because this game is **** bizarre. I think the best way to do it is to play the first stage with you, okay? And maybe we'll go beyond that but, but the first stage is, um, thank you for that Greg, the first stage is basically a tutorial stage and it explains how strange this game is. Now at its core, Nick, Nam Nom Galaxy is about making soup, okay? Did our Winnebago just crash? Our, our space Winnebago just crashed? Oh man, and so",

Our, our space Winnebago just crashed? Oh man, and so we're going to be working our way through and, and I feel like this is the the best way to kind of explain the game. The idea of the game is to make soup on alien planets and control the market share of that particular Planet soup manufacturer. Got it. That's what the idea, the currency of this universe, no, there's a different currency. Soup is what everyone wants though. Everyone wants, people want to spend their currency on the soup, that sense. So right now we're going and all I'm doing right now is using the left analog stick and the X button to jump around here, but the game will get a little more complicated. For instance, this is oxygen and you're going to learn here that you need to get oxygen in an Astro suit. So you find little pockets of bubbles like this, okay? And it refills our oxygen and",

Got it. Um, and the super Factory as our, as our Droid here let us know is nearby. So now I'm using the right stick to use the buzz saw as I use the left stick to, I have to do this for anyone, uh, who is a fan of this particular movie, buzz saw ready? Yes, thank you. You like that? Great. Bone songs ready? There you, you're right, you're right, you're right Greg, he's paying attention. So buzz saw is ready.

If I just kind of keep going using my buzz saw, you can find them like right here, here and I'm collecting them right now. I have 1100 and we're going to need those in a little while. We got to be careful though as we're going to see a minute because if I get too a little too overzealous with Buzz sawing , I can create devastating, uh, effects. Well, devastating like rock falls and things of this nature, okay? But here I'm going to use ladder, I'm going to use matter which is the currency to make ladders and I'm going to go up here inste on top of it and then press up on the d-pad and I'm going to spend a little bit of currency to be able to do that. So you're going to need the Cur those areas exactly cuz it's the right thing to do and now it is the right thing to do and I know that you are man that appreciates doing",

At first I was wrong, but now I'm just trying to drive the joke into the ground. Okay, fair and annoy Greg has a double hash smash the Dunst hash smash the Dunst hash kill wor. So here we're going to see a little little like land slide action. You see like we got get out of there, get out of there before it damn. All right, so now we're at the soup manufacturer, the training Factor only has the Bare Essentials, but it's missing a few vital Parts according to our Droid and so we're going to need to find some things. You ever place the destroyed machines in corridors so the factory can start making soup. So basically this is our Soup Factory, but it's in ill repair",

Our robots can't do the job Nick, so we have to do a few things and one of those things right now is going over here where the arrow is and then pressing triangle and we're going to need a soup machine, um, and we can afford it. So we're going to put it there, press X and and then place it where it needs to go and then we're going to press X and it's going to build build itself. Now here's the deal, I want you to just let's take a second, okay, to appreciate I don't understand anything you've said so far. That's fine, okay? I just okay, we can continue. Are you ready to go 100%? Okay, so now we're going to go over here, we're going to press triangle and and we need a Super Rocket, okay?

So we're going to need a Super Rocket to do that. I don't even think that you need me here for this to be honest because everything saying doesn't make any sense. It's going to get crazier though. It's going to get crazy. It is. So now you sound like an insane person . So now our Soup Factory has a way to get the soup to Market, okay? But we don't have the necessary ingredients and we also have a broken quarter that we need to fix, okay? So we can't we can't make the soup and we can't deliver the soup to the delivery mechanism exactly because we need to fix the corridor first. So we're going to spend 50 more of the currency we found in the green Lush ground that we use our buzz saw, right? And we're going to press x, uh, where it's where it's",

So there now Corridor is fixed, the soup machine is working. Now we need ingredients, okay? Okay and we're going to need some blue cat mushrooms, Nick. So we're going to go down here, we're going to climb, okay, we're going to fall. How do we know where the mushrooms are because it was pointing me down there. So right right here we're we're good. So we're going to use the buzz saw ready to kind of get them and then we're going to pick one up with the circle button, okay? We're going to bring the blue blue cat mushroom back up to the suit machine. Now speaking of mushrooms, mhm, is this something that you think the developers of this game did a lot of while making",

If you've ever played a Pixel Junk game, you know that they're basically drug trips, okay? And that's the beauty of it and I think Greg would agree that Greg huge into drugs, Greg's huge into drugs and he's also huge into Pixel Junk games. Yeah, just like me. So we're going to go to here and we're going to insert the the the mushroom, but of course Nick, we need more than one ingredient. You can't have mushroom soup, that's gross. To make creamed corn buug soup, we're going to need tomates. Creamed corn buug soup is my favorite. So it shows you where the tomates are right and I think we're they're showing us just for the sake of this tutorial that I'm R but the next level we have to go out and look for these things on our own, right?

The doz of people exactly who hung in there to see if this game start we good like people hang around watch these videos. I think most no no I know that we have a great hang time. We have some of the best best friends on the planet and that watches this. This particular one though, I would have to imagine a lot of people are watching and just going huh, just huh. I think you're I think you're overselling that in the sense that I think a lot of our audien is plenty familiar with what Pixel D does. think so? Yes, I think there's would you think so Greg?

So oh you found the tomes. Oh I got a real I got a real name request up there. So I got to kill these guys and eventually I'm using my buzz saw. They take quite a bit of damage, but now they're dead and now I can pick one up and I have I have what I need get out of there before they turn nasty. Bring that tomat steak back to the factory with you. I'm trying but this guy is on my **** this guy is inside you. He's so up on you. I know my God he is inside me. All right, let's get out of there, get out of there. I'm trying my hardest here. So we're going to bring the second essential ingredient back to our Soup Factory Nick, okay?

Now Nick, this is where the game gets a little weird because the game's not weird yet, okay? We're making soup on alien planets and we're sending soup into space to sell, but what we have to keep in mind is the economics of the soup and specifically that we have competitors and our competitors are super competitors on this stage are GSA training of course and they're not very good and you can see in the corner our market share is going up. Yeah, we 64%, 65% on and on and on CR it and we haven't even sent anything to market yet which is incredible. People are anticipating this suit. I was going to say it's not even it's not even fair.

Now the soup machine will turn those two ingredients into a delicious can as you're going to see here, okay? And then what we're going to do, uh, is, uh, we're going to pick up the can and then we're going to bring it to our rocket and we're going to put it in and we're going to deliver the the SP the soup to market now and the soup has been set. All right , but the stage isn't over yet. No, of course no. Why would it be? It shouldn't be. It really should it doesn't deserve to be just yet, just yet.

We push a lot of stuff out market like this let's play and it will be consumed by big aliens. But here's the problem, people are jealous of our ability to ship soup to Market. They're going to talk and now we need to defend the soup. They're talking **** so they got to get shot exactly. That's exactly right. So we're going to go up here and we're going to press triangle again and we're going to need to build things. We're going to need to build a Shot Tower. This will Inc increase our defense good.

We've almost hit 100% market share soon there will be no stopping us. We have 95% of the market right now 96 for in this particular Market we get it we did it it's okay for our enemies to physically attack us which in other markets probably not so much.
