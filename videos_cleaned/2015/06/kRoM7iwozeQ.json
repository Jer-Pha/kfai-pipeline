Yeah, so we were to like, um, today there was a game, you're gonna have to help me, what it's called, Perception? No, it's something like that, right? Or is it? I backed it. Let me check my tweets. There's a game that was made by ex-Bioshock developers, obviously. Um, you know, Irrational is no more and those guys got laid off. Irrational is Boston based, so a lot of these guys stayed in Boston and created new, Perception. Sorry, by Deep End Games. Deep End Games is the new studio and the game is called Perception and it's a game that seems to be inspired a great deal by Gone Home, which is a game we very much love, which is a more explorative, um, narrative based game. But in this game you play as a blind woman and what's interesting is that you have no tools at your disposal except for like some sort of echolocating kind of thing and",

Um, and we were seeing the trailer, the game looks beautiful. I'm not quite entirely sure like what the, like what the perspective of your character is going to be if she's like truly blind, in other words if the screen would be black or whatever. That's the Perception. Yeah, yeah, or that's the, that's how it is. I mean if you've seen Daredevil on Netflix when they go into his field of view, that's what it looks like and that's what they're talking about is like by using your phone or you know, throwing things in the room, you get to see, you know, the sound waves echo off stuff, come back to you, you see what it is basically, right? But then you're being, you're, there's this monster around the house too that you're trying to avoid. So the question",

So the question becomes, do I throw this vase down the end of the hall to see the entire hall or will that alert the person or the monster to where I am and stuff like that and you have to hide and good Lord. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, and so it, it brought it, brought up a, like it's, it's a brilliant idea. It's a game that it's, it's a type of game that I've never heard of before. I've never, I've never heard of a game like this, you know, and it reminds me of other really unique like Sound Shapes for instance, which was a really **** Su V games, like a really, really, really unique game where you're platforming but you're making music as you go and like the things you, the decisions you make and the things you collect like make the music more robust or less robust like for all the games we like, we were talking about",

Like these games are unique and they resonate with me more. It's the same thing with Gone Home, like people ****, some people give Gone Home ****. I don't think they know what they're talking about. Like I think Gone Home was extraordinary, um, and it's simp, you know, but also in it's, it's residence, it's emotional residence, ex-Bioshock guys. Mhm. So yeah, I mean yeah, it seems like a lot of people have learned a great deal from Ken LaVine. Yeah, go figure. Yeah, just you just kind of hear, I mean a lot of, I mean , uh, you know, I've talked to Walt Williams a lot in the past.

All I did was like learn from the master. That's ****. Yeah, yeah, and then he went wrote Spec Ops and Bioshock is of course one of the great games of all time. So yeah, I just wanted to bring up some unique games, like games that you've never, you know, that are different. You can never make another Sound Shapes. You can make a sequel to it but there could never be another Sound Shapes. There'll be games inspired by Sound Shapes and stuff. That's what you're talking about.

In the way that and I've used this analogy before, the Silly Putty thing, right? When games start they're very simple, we know what that is and then people start stretching it out in all these different directions and now there's a game for every mood and everything you're in, right? And that's what's awesome is that every day now a new Kickstarter pops up for something in the same vein of that, right? Is that apartment game, A Separated Place that we did a let's play for, right? Like I immediately went and gave them $80 on Kickstarter. I'm like I love your idea here of this again, it's a narrative driven game, you know, it starts that I'm the first story we played was you're in an apartment dealing with, you know, your",

I think of these games that have the power to put me in someone else's shoes in a way I would have never been able to.

Well I think that's something that makes game so unique is when you don't know about it and it's a new experience that you can't even imagine because once you kind of have an idea of what it is it it changes it, you know, and I feel like when you say what's the most unique game like a couple popping my head, Journey is one of them but I feel like Journey I didn't have that connection with in the same way because I knew about it. People were like oh you should play this this is a thing. So my answer would be Flower before Journey.

I'm like man there's a lot of this looks like a tech demo but it looks like a cool engaging Tech demo I want to try it. So I just bought it downloaded it and then and as I was playing it in the first level you're just kind of flying around like you you're learning the mechanics when you first look at it it doesn't look like a game.

You know, uh, like when you're playing Guitar Hero and you you're not even **** looking anymore you're just kind of like holy **** this is just happening I'm doing it.

Yeah, that is the unique experience. Flower is a great game. Um, Journey to me was a game where people kept telling me to play. I had a different experience from you because I knew what it was and people kept tell me to play.
