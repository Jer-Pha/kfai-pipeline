Honda, Guile, Chun Li, Zangief, Dhalsim, you know all these characters then obviously Vega and Balrog and Sagat and Bison like they have to be in the game right like those are the core characters and then you started to pick up what was it Super Street Fighter that's when you picked up Cammy and DJ and T-Hawk and and there was one more Cammy DJ T-Hawk and um oh Fei Long, Fei Long right and then like so those like with the exception of Cammy you can get rid of all those characters I don't think anyone like cares about any of those characters see that's the thing and then you have the Alpha Characters like Rolento and all like I just think you",
