Thank you all for your support and your lovely, lovely faces. Thank you so much, all the interaction on Patreon.com. Nick, what's your topic? I have to go to the bathroom . Sorry. I love you so much. It's fine. Be right back. So, Nick, we thank them. Now, what's your topic? My topic, um, has something to do with, with where we just came back from, MomoCon. MomoCon had a great time. Con. It is the Peach Con. It's the con for, uh, all the Peach Growers of Atlanta. Thankfully, they get to be a part of that show. No, um , these conventions always fascinate me because, um, people go for a different, a lot of different reasons, but I think the number one reason they go is, is, is for camaraderie, right? They get to be around like-minded, uh, friends. Uh, in our case, uh, our community gets to sort of meet each other in person for the first time sometimes. Um, I love hearing the fact that people, uh, you know, come together and",

Um, but I find it fascinating because I never, these conventions didn't exist when I was young, when you were young. Um, so I often wonder if I were that age and I were so inclined to go, uh, would I be, would I A, go, and B, would I be a cosplayer if I did go? And if I were a cosplayer, and this is the topic, sorry for the long walk, there's like a bunch of subcategories this topic, what would I go as?

So wait, are we kids now or adults? Or is this all different questions? I, what, as an adult, how do you view cosplay? And if you were, if you had a dress-up gun to the head, what would you go as?

Um, but yeah, you see these people who first off are putting together amazing costumes, have amazing physiques, do all this, like I'm blown away every time I see cosplay, which is why as an adult, I don't think I'll ever do cosplay'cause I don't have a body for any of the characters I love.

And then a shout out before I passed the baton to anybody else at MomoCon. There was an awesome Shovel Knight walking around. Yes. Awesome. For me, I, cosplay is really interesting because, you know, when you're first exposed to it, it's kind of just like, oh, it's like Halloween when it's not Halloween, just people in costume.

And that's not to say that you can't just buy the stuff and that doesn't count or whatever,'cause like there is something to looking, looking like the person and like wearing the right costume for who you are or whatever it is for who you are. Um, but even then, it's, there's something you said about the people that do not look like the character at all, but because their costume's so good, it still has that feel.

Like it's not just, oh, I dress up and it's kind of fun. It's like they love, like in the same way that I love making videos and love doing this stuff, they love making costumes. They love thinking about what their next thing's going to be, learning new skills, learning new skills and like actually crafting, like creating, like 3D printing and going, I forget if it was Vampy or if it was Meg, but one of them was like getting super excited'cause they were going to learn like leather making, you know what I mean? So for their next costume, they can make their own holsters. And I would just like Google, you know, and try to find this to buy it and have it. But they, they don't want that , you know?

And then eventually their, their level of, uh, love and passion for, for this like takes you where all of us do, where you're like, you, like you for instance, went from like looking at other people that were making videos to going, \"I can do that.\" Yeah. And now learning those skills every day and then realizing, \"Holy shit, like it's that one second where you have to admit to yourself like, oh, this is a lifelong endeavor. I'm going to do this forever and I'm just going to keep getting better at it.\" But I don't really, I don't, that's not what, like it's not about reaching something, it's about just having fun and progressing and learning new shit and like getting better at it.

It's like, \"Damn, you, you have the body for that and you have the look for that and the costume was perfect.\" So it's like, great. But then as I start seeing her do a bunch of different ones, it's like, it's to the point now, it's like it's not even about the character so much as it's about her. And it's just like, it's cool seeing her do things, her interpretation. You know, Jessica Nigri, that's a whole different thing where like she has a, a very unique style. When you look at her stuff, it's like she has a very sexy style. She has a very like, \"I'm going to take this thing and make it sexy.\" And she sort of like reverse engineers that, like, like cook would do, right?

And that's the thing, she does it to a point where you're like, \"That is actually a tasteful level of sexiness.\" Yeah, I mean, it's, it's interesting because it's like you can almost look at just the, the costume and be like, \"Oh, that looks like a Jessica Nigri costume.\" And that's cool. Like that's art, you know? And I think a lot of people, uh, overlook that and just look at it, it's just like they'll have all their comments and they'll say their, their things . But it's like there is so much thought put into these things and so much just like weird decisions that need to be made and just the sheer stress and shit that you put your body through wearing these is insane.

The heat you need to deal with, having to carry the props, making sure that you're not breaking the 3D printed whatever, the belts that you made. Like there's so much of that stuff that goes into it. It's like, think of the most uncomfortable Halloween costume you've ever had to wear when you were trick-or-treating and how upset you were that night, knowing that you were going to get the candy, so it was all good, but just upset at the shit that you had to deal with. But imagine that when every five seconds, fucks like me are stopping you to ask to take a picture and all that stuff. And it's like, \"Oh God, that's the payoff too.\" That's their moment. And it's like, it's always great for me to see like my friends, like Sheena from, um, D-Pad Te family. She, she's fucking awesome. Like she does a whole bunch of different cosplays .

And it's like, it's cool that it goes both pictures, but they want pictures, validating what they, because what they do, a lot of people see as like a real thing. So, and what's also interesting to me is I feel like a lot of these people, like, you know, we, we think like, what would we dress as? Mmm-hmm. We obviously jump to the things that we like, you know, like the, the game franchises we love or the Superman or whatever. It's interesting to me to see some of these people dress as characters like for anime characters where they don't watch the anime or whatever.

Then there's the complete opposite of that of they love this character, they, they've invested for years, so it means something to them. That's the camp I would fall into if I was. Because like the work and stuff, when you follow these people on Instagram, on their Twitter, like the work and hours and all the stuff that goes into it, I would have to be like making something that I'm super, super into and believe in, right? Like'cause even like I've kicked around like I thought about like maybe I , maybe I would cosplay as Teddie from Persona. But then how the fuck do I know to build a Teddie costume?

You know what I mean? There's so many amazing things. But there was a dude who came in a Claptrap outfit he made. And it was that, you know, he got there and the party's like three or four hours long. And then there's like a costume contest at the end of it. So like after 30 minutes of being there, he was just like leaning the thing on a couch, like him in it still. He refused to get out of it'cause he wanted to take photos and move the arms and do.

It's kind of like part of my character. It's like a joke, but it's like I legitimately, I love Disney, you know? And so it's like Disney Princesses are going to be a thing that are at every convention. You're going to see people dress up as, as any of them. There's so many now. And it's cool because they're always slightly different variations because they don't, I mean, they sell costumes for those things, but most of those, they, the people make them in some way. And it's cool seeing all the different little variations and stuff. And it's like I love the interpretations.

But I don't like it when people just use it as an excuse to wear a costume'cause it's like, that's, you're missing the point of this. Like when people are just wearing like a, um, a giraffe like onesie. Mmm-hmm. Okay. It's like, or the kid with a banana. We had a fan . But be honest, that made me laugh and I was like, \"Thank you for wearing that banana.\" But it's one of those things where it's like, I wonder what the, why they did that. If it was like, maybe it's their starter, it's their starter drug on this whole.

I want to know because it's like that, I do want to know the answer to that question is, why did you dress like a banana? Why did you dress like a giraffe? Why did you dress like these things that are just like, I don't think these are characters. I could be wrong'cause the world is vast. There's so many different things. And that's the thing, there's not rules to cosplay. It's not like it's only anime people or like there's Disney Princesses. What the fuck?

Colin, cosplay thoughts and who would you cosplay as? Um, I mean, I'm not a fan of cosplay personally, but I mean, you can do whatever you want. That's totally fine. I appreciate it. I, I, I, my whole thing is more kind of to Tim's point that if you're going to do it, I think you should do it right. I see a lot of like, I see a lot of great cosplay and then I see things that seem a little half-assed to me that I don't , that I don't quite understand. But to each his own.

And when you're in places like we were at MomoCon, where you're in CNN Center, there's a lot of serious people there. And then, you know, in the hotel where a lot of people are staying, I just, I, my favorite thing was watching them watching cosplayers. Um, my, my story of that, and let's get back to it, is the fact that I remember once I got a cab at PAX Prime. And I, you know how when you leave PAX, no, I'm sorry, PAX,'cause you walk out and there's that Westin there. I got the cab there . I Ubered it. And I came around the, and then we were stuck in the traffic trying to get out of the Westin. And, and Vampy Bit Me was over there and she was in her Zero Suit Samus outfit with the Met roid like on her hat, head or in her hand by her head. And the guy's like, \"What",

And what I mean by that is like there's always one or two people at E3 that are cosplaying. And I'm like, \"No, you don't, you don't cosplay. This is an industry show.\" But, uh, you know, it's fun if that's what you want to do. That's great. I, I was talking to Tim about it and I'm like, people would expect so little of me in terms of like cosplaying or doing that. I would love to do like, see, just in secret, just like a, the most ornate thing you've ever seen in your life and then just show up at one of these shows. Awesome.

Like a guy, he didn't have like a mask on or anything like that. The, the thing about Day-to-Day is it's not right without the face. So that would cost, like you, he has to be, it has to be that crazy like, you know, like that sociopathic like, \"I'm going to kill you with this hammer.\" Nah, that face. But I, I want the, I want the, the like his face. I would , I would love to get a mask, like a really beautifully done mask that I could wear. If I could do that, then I'd probably just do Day-to-Day and just be, be him or whatever. Because I feel like I see, I've never seen, I've never, ever, ever in my life seen good Mega Man cosplay.

Will you sell that to me? Yeah, the like, but like the face is what the essence of Day-to-Day is, that face. Yeah. So like that's the big problem with me. But the things that I really love, like the things that I would dress up as is like nothing for Mega Man's going to work except for maybe Wily would be.
