Now, recently, I don't know why I do this sometimes where I'll go like I'll be watching a movie and I'll go on IMDb and just start reading facts about it. Um, and one of the things that I love to read, especially the old movies, is the tagline for a movie. Yes, right? And uh, specifically, if you're not familiar with this this term, which I'm sure you are, but I'll define it for anyway, it's the the line of text underneath the title on the poster, right? And I want to start, I want to just read something to you guys and see if you can guess the movie that they're from. Oh, okay. Does that work for you guys? All right, yeah. This time it's for real. You got to angle it away from me, cuz I won't try to cheat, but I will cheat. Okay, hold on a sec. I I mean, I'm you know how it is, your eyes will catch it. You'll see it's Lethal Weapon 4, like, fuck, it's Lethal Weapon 4. Well, all of them.",

All right, next one. Greg, who are you gonna call? They put my name on it. Ghostbusters. Greg, who you gonna call? What? This is a little harder one. You might not know the movie for this one, but think hard on this. Reality is a thing of the past. Being John Malkovich. No, but that's okay. You got one. It's a good guess. No, I'm going to say The Lawnmower Man. No, but it's close, very close, cuz it deals with men and machines. Scanners. No. The Terminator. No. Damn, men going into machines.

Yeah, I mean, I mean, the really obviously these are iconic movies and they're really good taglines, so you can you can get kind of where they're from. But you'll believe a man can fly. Superman. That's really good. That's really going. I did not know that until I saw that and then I saw poster. I was like, that is oh, that was like their selling. They were so blown away with their visual effects for his flying. H now this one's uh obviously very easy, but give it to you anyway. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Star Trek.
