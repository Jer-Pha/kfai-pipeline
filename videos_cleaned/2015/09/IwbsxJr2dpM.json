Yes, I want to talk about pumpkin spice. Oh, okay. Specifically, I love pumpkin spice, and I've loved, and like, I, I'm not, I try not to be hipster about a lot of things. I've liked a lot of things longer than they've been in vogue, right? I like my, I like my dark room glasses since Revenge of the Nerds, not when Weezer brought, brought them back around and everything else, right? But I love Weezer, so I'm not mad about that comparison.

And a North Face. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yoga tight. But that was my thing. I was just like, now pumpkin spice, the, the tables are turning on pumpkin spice, and I don't like it, 'cause I don't want people to be afraid of pumpkin spice. And when I say people, I mean people making products. I'd like to see us bite down and commit to pump. That's how it works, though, Greg.

Now you're going like an, we need a whiteboard behind you and a marker. Greg Miller explains life, but the reason they like it is it's because that's as edgy as they can get. The pumpkin spice is the most extreme, the most out of the basicness. It's like, \"Oh, I'm gonna do something wild today. I'm a Pumpkin Spice Latte, not just a mocha.\" Scarpino, so your, your theory, we'll call it, yes, is that they, they live the normal life six out of the seven days a week until, and then it comes to like, until the fall, and then it's Friday night, and it's just like, you know, let's take the pants off, let's make the babies, put the leggings, put the leggings on.",

That's why I save it for the Easter show. But I always wonder, is it, is it so special because they limit it? Of course it is, right? They create that artificial demand for it every year, all year long. And then you go to Starbucks and like, \"Wait a minute, did someone draw a clever chalk drawing of a pumpkin?

Last year, like two years ago, I guess three years ago, I, I went to, uh, the mall with Mike Mitchell. God only knows what we were there for. I forget, maybe a George Foreman Grill.

See, what's weird to me is like with Starbucks, I mean, I get that they do the seasonal thing just to create hype and stuff, but it's like, I don't think that pump, like the pumpkin spice, it, it should just be a normal thing. It's like a vanilla latte, like Pumpkin Spice Latte. It just fills in with just, it's just a flavored thing. Like, well, but when do you ever see pumpkins? No, I know, but like, that's, that's true.

I don't know what, what Starbucks, isn't that the new thing this year that, that everybody's pissed off about, is that they went from powdered whatever, actually pumpkin puree in some of them, and now the taste is a little bit different. That's nasty. It tastes too natural. I'm going, I'll find this on the internet. Ask Kevin can do it for you. We have Kevin.

But, uh, you know, it is a season. I got last week. Oh, definitely is. Um, but what, what another thing that I think that is, that makes this so successful is the fact that it's acronymed, being able to call the PSL. Like the, the basic, what, what? Oh, no, that's a thing. But really thing, even Starbucks sells it that way. Like, I mean, I'm looking at a news report right there, and there it is, PSL. That's so stupid. That's not is the thing.

Well, Food Babe would be now if she launched the site now. That's what she would call it. Uh, difficult quest to learn what's actually in the Pumpkin Spice Latte. What she discovered, there's no pumpkin in it. The latte included two doses of caramel color level four, a coloring made with ammonia that contains the substance 4-MeI, and an artificial fl, and artificial flavors reportedly made from substances like petroleum. While the substances are considered safe by the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA last year said that it will review the safety and quote, generally recognized as safe status for 4-MeI after a Consumer Reports study found that a dozen soft drinks have higher than recommended doses of the substance.",

Fans were not thrilled, and now Starbucks has responded. The company announced Monday that when Pumpkin Spice Lattes hit stores this fall, they will be made with real pumpkin and without the caramel coloring. All right, so this is a **** article because no one cares about, is it healthier? They want to know, is it good? Is it better? Right? Is it worse? I'm inclined to say, no, it's not better. It's not better with real pumpkin. I've had, have you ever had real pumpkin pie? Makes it with pumpkin. Yeah, pumpkin's awesome. Is it awful?

We like the artificial pumpkin flavor that reminds you of fall. Now, I like real pumpkin too. I do go out of my way to enjoy a good pumpkin. Now, squash, I don't actually, I know that I don't, I'm, but here's, I'm looking at this article right now from the Detroit Free Press.

She gets excited about it. Okay, yeah. What was your pro, like, did you, here's what I want to know to test your relationship from the weekend. Yeah, did you go to In-N-Out? No. Okay, no, we didn't. I saw her tweet about, yeah, she wanted to go In-N-Out, and you didn't want to, 'cause you don't even like In-N-Out that much. But also, you thought it tastes too healthy. It tastes too healthy. Now, it was a horrible misquote. But what was being said was, it was a whole ordeal where we were doing like a family outing with her family, and her little sister wanted to go to In-N-Out. She's a big fan of In-N-Out. My girlfriend likes In-N-Out. And then the mom was like, \"No, we're not going.\"",

I'm like, \"It's just not like the In-N-Out we're going to is next to a McDonald's or a Carl's Jr. I'd rather go to either of those at any given moment.\" You're so stupid. Yeah, that's, that's ABD. The biggest reason I've never been more disappointed in you guys when we stopped in that road trip and there was an In-N-Out right there. You guys, \"Let's go to McDonald's.\" I was like, \"All right, man.\" It's just like that. The **** In-N-Out. It's, it's over, overhyped. I don't think it's bad at all. I enjoy In-N-Out.
