Now here's the thing, you jumped into it real quick, just start going. I'll explain what's happening. We don't want to show too much. We're not going to spoil too much for you guys, 'cause obviously you want to enjoy the campaign for yourselves. So what we're going to do is we're going to do three 5-minute chunks from different parts early on in the campaign. It's going to be fun. You're limited to your 5 minutes, 'cause we don't want, we don't want you going too long here. Okay, yep, full campaign speedrun going down right now. We say speedrun, it's going to be the first time Diaz has ever played this game, but you are you Mr. First-Person Shooter. I play a lot of them. Therefore, I'm your first-person shooter. That's all you do. I'm saying you're good at them. Here's the thing, getting old, I mean, his reflexes going out the window. It's okay, it's okay. All right, so you, you were playing maybe 15",

All right, so you, you were playing maybe 15 minutes before this section here. What do you feel so far? Uh, just, it looks good, plays well so far. Still getting used to like dashing left and right, things like that. Mhm. Um, but it's Halo. I just tossed away a new gun, but that's fine. So I've always been a big fan of the Halo campaigns, as you know, me and you have a very storied history when it comes to Halo franchise, playing co-op throughout all the, the different campaign, campaign modes in Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, through all that stuff. Mhm. Um, immediately looking at this, you got the teams, right? There's the Blue Team with you. You got Linda the sniper. Yep. You got all these, these different characters. How is that affecting the gameplay? Um, so far, I mean, if I go down, they revive me, so that's, that's new. Okay, but I have a fireteam. They're not really firing at things",

They're not really firing at things at the moment. I'm sure things will happen later on. I think the cool thing though is like, if you're like a hardcore Halo fan, like I read the book Fall of Reach, and like these guys are all characters from the books, like Linda and and Fred and all that kind of stuff. Like these are the Spartans that were part of like the Spartan program that Master Chief was a part of. So it's really cool like seeing them. And I don't know, remember, I just remember like how Halo used to be where it's like, oh, it's just Master Chief, he's the lone Spartan. And now there's just a ton of them, like a heck ton. And I know it's interesting, it's cool though, like it's very different rolling with a team of Spartans. Yeah, see what's really cool though is, you know, Halo's always kind of those Halo moments, you know, where it's you're",

Like even what's going on right now, you know, in this room, there's a whole bunch of enemies kind of like taking them out. Now you have your team with you, so that's a little different. But earlier, it was very, very Halo moment. I'm not going to spoil anything. I just want to charge that grunt. Certain music started playing and you turned back at me and you just give me the biggest smile. I'm like, this is good. Alfredo is smiling about something. Just happened in Halo. Let's just say Chief's team made an entrance. We'll leave it at that. Okay, I'm moving. I mean, it's, it's, it's new, but it's also, it's more of what you know, right?

Yeah, they're really, it's, that's cool. Oh, so there's no way you couldn't have gotten past that? No, that was a cinematic. That was, that was okay. Okay, cool. Can we skip this? Is it skippable? I mean, it's beautiful, but I, I don't want to waste our 5 minutes with. I got it. I'm skipping. I never know what. I'm the guy that's like against skipping cinematic, not spoiling stuff, spoilers.

Brutes have fallen, you know, sleeping on the job and stuff. Oh, see, that was unnecessary. See, it's cool to see he was just chilling. Seeing Halo on the Xbox One. Halo looking Halo-y, looking like The Meta from Red vs. Blue. Anyone gets that reference, I like you a lot. Okay, where are we? Oh, okay, start marching. This is the first Halo made from the ground up on one. Big deal. Yeah, I mean, it looks good. I, I can't say that enough. All right, so right here, I went down. I can request assistance.

We're about to do the second of the 5 minutes of the Halo 5 campaign. Alfredo, let's get right into it. Right into it. Uh, I have a Battle Rifle. I've got a sword. So we thought this was going to be a good section going into it, because we saw the Hunter like bust in on the glass and we're like, all right, a battle. Oh, oh, did he just bust that away? Oh my God. No, F. What is? Did not see that coming. Yeah, the Halo 1 pistol would be very helpful right now. Yeah, this is the good. Just remember, yeah, Halo Hunters like, oh my goodness, they're so badass. And all of a sudden they charge you and just one shot to the back. I don't even, I don't what.

I'm going to tell my, I'm going to tell the fireteam to focus fire on Big Boy number one. I'm, I'm, I'm going to name him. This guy's Ch, the other J. Okay, how you taking down Ch? Ch's done. Ch is done. J might be tough here. Getting a little, is this, can I back, back up? There we go. So how do you focus? How do you make your team? So if I press down the D-pad, that's to show me where my next objective is. Um, and then if I press uh, so like I pressed uh up on the D-pad, it kind of tells them where to go. Or if I press it at on an actual enemy, tells them to focus fire on him. Okay, yeah, I was wondering that off the bat. I was just like, they're just kind of standing there. Where's my support?

I wouldn't, you know what I mean? Something important. Why would you punch it? At least based on the books, 'cause obviously I haven't played too much of this. Who are these characters? Uh, these guys are the Spartans that are part of like the, the Spartan program that John was a part of. So these are the ones that actually made it, you know what I mean? What they, what are they known for? So we got uh Linda is a sniper. Okay, Kelly. Then you have Kelly and then you have Fred. Do they have anything special about them?

Uh, nope. Here we go. Oh, here. See how we do. You got 1 and 1/2 minutes left. What? That's not 5 minutes. Works. Okay, look. All right, 5 minutes. Trying to spoil the world coming out soon enough. People want to see this. They want to see this failure of gameplay. But at the same time, it's amazing. Jack got Jack moved mantle. Oh, that was cool. Yeah, you can mantle now. Whole bunch of, it's just interesting. There's like more mechanics now into, into the game. I mean, so what, what's new?

Very interesting. Like how you're just running through uh the dashes. So I get like side dash left and right. Uh, there we go. That's cool. It's little what else besides that, man? I mean, it plays well, shoots well. We're playing on normal. I'm sure someone's asking that just because I don't want to die over and over again my first time. You know what I mean?
