This stems from fact, how old are you, Grimecraft? I'm 25. Good, whole life ahead of. I like this because this means that we can relate on. No, you're also 25, right? No, I'm 26 now. Okay, but still, I'll be 26 in like a month. Okay, good. Yeah, we're we're similarly aged, so we have similar interests, the Pok\u00e9mon and all that stuff. Pok\u00e9mon. But I remember when we first met you, it was like a whirlwind of just happiness and just fantasy kind of colliding into one because you were probably one of my favorite people I've ever met.

So it's like it's you're you're really cool in all those ways. Hanging out with you for like 3 days down in uh Plano, Texas, you taught us some stuff. I taught you guys some stuff. You taught us a lot of stuff, specifically the words lit and sus. Yes, which are two opposite ends of the spectrum that anything can be judged on pretty much. Is it lit or is it sus? Yeah, we cannot stop using these words. We in our daily vocabulary, it's now a thing. #Lit is probably my most most used word on any social media platform. I want you to teach us more. More.

It's either going to be a good night or it's going to be a bad night. What time is it? It's it's like 10:00 p.m. What's the bathroom situation? Are there stall doors on the stalls? You walk in and you know if it's lit or if it's sus. If you walk in at 10:00 p.m. and it's packed, the bathrooms are slammed, everyone's dancing, there's a thousand hot girls like making out people. Damn, it's lit. That's lit. It's it's lit. The DJ's going ham. Like it's lit. If you walk in at 10:00 p.m., let's take a step back because you're using you're throwing all sorts of terminologies.

Some might say effortless, effortlessly. That that um you you just throw out ham as as a as a verb. That's that's hard as a. Like, oh, it's an acronym. You never listened to Kanye. Wow. See, I knew going ham, but I didn't know what to going ham. Yeah, going ham, all in. It is it is all in. Well, I know that's why I could get away not knowing the actual definition. I didn't realize it was an acronym. Yeah, the more you know. Yeah, please like make that happen, Kevin.

So this was another thing is when we were when you were learning all this, you were teaching us about about Fleek, which I knew. I knew most of these things, at least of what they were. Hear Nick talk about it is the funniest thing because for the longest time you thought Fleek was flick. She was like, oh, it's on flick. That's flick. And that's funny to say. And honestly, making up words like that is kind of probably half the reason a lot of these slang words exist. Someone just said something stupid one day and it sticks. That's I mean, yeah, but that's the other thing too is it is it is sort of a a litness of whether or not you're in that culture, right?

We also used to say, I think Rad's kind of coming back. Is it coming back? It's definitely coming back. Uh, I say the word dope a lot because dope used to I say dope. Dope. Yeah, I use dope almost every day. But do you remember when we used to call things that were good, bad? Yeah, say that's bad. Like the Power Glove. He's bad. Power Power made popular by Michael Jackson's Bad, right? Yeah. Who's Bad? Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson was bad. That means good, Greg. Oh, so ham. When when I call someone a ham, that means they're a goofball. You're a ham. I know. I mean, ham it up for the camera. Yeah, you're a big old ham. You are.

We learned lit. We learned lit. We learned lit. Learn. We've gone to the club. 10:00, girls hanging out with each other. DJ going ham, lit. Ding. And the bathrooms are nice. Ding, ding, ding, ding. The bathrooms aren't nice. That's they aren't nice. If they aren't nice. Yeah, I mean, I I guess like if you're talking about a bathroom by itself and it being lit, uh it would mean there was people even partying in there. It's just crazy. Yeah. Okay, so so I'm going to paint the other picture for you. Here's the sus. Here's the sus. You walk 10:00. You walk in. It sounds loud. There's a line, right? And then you get you wait line.

This happens a lot in my neighborhoods, particularly a place called The Brickton. It's annoying. You think there's a bunch of hot people in there because there's a couple hot people in line. You go in. It's three cocktail waitresses and a bartender that couldn't give 10 shits that you want a drink. Yep. And then you go to the bathroom situation and it's so so what is this to you? That's sus, man. I mean, it it's you know, any situation where it is uh you know, it's suspect. It's suspicious. It's it's it's just not a good feeling.

It's like you're pooping looking at your dick. Sus. There's a place I go to a lot, well, I used to go to a lot called The Comic Club that has one of those where it's just like the bathroom's not even that far off the beaten path. You know what I mean? You been there? It's kind of right there. It's kind of like on the way to the dance floor. You look over and you see some light coming out. No door and no stall door. No stall door. And there's a urinal and a little divider and a toilet within maybe a foot and a half of each other. And so if you're peeing and someone has to come up to wash their hands, you're locked in.

And I'm like, why not? Why not go take a at what do you want her to do? Midnight in a club? You go to somewhere else. Where are you going to go? You leave the bar. Well, you do what I do. You go to one of the more mellow bars and you go to the bathroom over there. Or you know, I mean, there's no mellow bar after 11:00 P.M. for a bathroom. That's true.

I'm very very very excited. So what are the what is the iconography for sus or lit? Like what if I were to be like trying to explain it to somebody and needed to use emojis? Okay, well, Kevin, put them on the screen for you. Yeah, put them on the screen. My laptop actually, I have those emojis on my laptop, which is uh the Sus Moon. Mhm. Which is the full like dark moon.
