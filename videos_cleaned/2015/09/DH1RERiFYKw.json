It it killed me playing as much as I wanted to last night. I was going to say this is the problem. It came out right and we're still in a Metal Gear mode, but we have to play this game as well. God, so have you played any Mario Maker? Not yet, no. Are you familiar with the the looks freaking awesome? Holy shit, it is such a good game. And the thing is, it is a game I am very happy with how much they have made making a game, a game like actually making the courses and stuff and having like the way that they teach you how to do this stuff the first time you boot it up and like you you have to make a stage and the way that they teach you it feels like a video game. Even creating the stuff feels like it and I love that. And then you play the levels and it's like this is shit Mario and the subtleties that they add and like the people I am obviously very",

Mario is probably my favorite franchise ever. And it's just like this is this does to Mario what Smash Bros. does to Nintendo in the sense that this is like a museum and history of Mario in one thing. Yeah, and all the different options you can do for all the the different gameplay styles with there's Mario 1, Mario 3, Mario World, and New Super Mario Wii U or whatever the shit. Um, the differences between that stuff, this game is so much deeper than I gave it credit for. Interesting. That's off my my first impressions. What what do you think about that? Deeper? Yeah, than what you thought it was. I'm I I don't know. I don't know what I thought it was, you know what I mean? I played it at events here and there obviously and when you're playing events it's like, oh, it's Mario. Okay, drop and do stuff.",

But to sit down and you know, Christine and I streamed on her channel the other day and played for like five hours something in a row, you know what I mean? In a row. Uh, I don't know why I sat there and played it, you know what I mean? And it's a weird game because I'm playing it and we're doing all the Nintendo, you know, you have 10 live things where you're playing the Nintendo made stages, the Mario, the 10 Mario Challenge. Thank you. Yeah, enjoying that. Jump into create stuff and my I think my disconnect was I never ever played a Mario and thought I wish I could make a Mario stage. Yeah, so when I jump into like now I'm crea it's like I don't one how no I I try I basically I just keep going in because I want to unlock everything because I want it all to be there because eventually I'm going to",

But playing it, it was a weird first impression because I jumped in expecting what we got in that our Mario Let's Play where when Nintendo passed us the controller, there was all those courses lined up to play and that isn't there. There's no menu that has that. Those levels are that are built by Nintendo are built into the 10 Mario Challenge or whatever. And so when I figured that out and I was playing through those, I like, oh, this is great. How much fun? Okay, cool. And then it was, well, we went on to, you know, play random levels, played a few of those like Hit or Miss, whatever. And then it was like, wait, Ducker tweeted.

And then it was like, that's awesome. And somebody's like, Miles from Rooster Teeth just point up like, shit, let's and like we went that way and fell down that hole of like playing Miles, playing Jeff from Giant Bomb, playing, you know what I mean? Like playing all these people that we knew and stuff. And I was like, that's really fun. And a weird thing happened where stream ended, went to Eric Castor's house that night, our friend of course, Master Bartender from Follow the Leader. He had just bought it. We played it where we pass the controller and like seven people who were there drinking, having fun where son dies, pass the controller and try the next one.

It was my birthday, so I had bought it. And then we had a whole bunch of people over the house, popped it in, played it for a weekend and never touched it again. And I that's what I said this felt like for Mario Maker. And the weird thing is I woke up the next day after Eric Castor's and I was hung over as shit. And I was like, I kind of feel like I was I plan to play Metal Gear and do S ranks and stuff. I kind of feel like playing Mario Maker. And I popped it in and then I was like, you know, shit it, let's see what the community is. And I jumped into Community levels and they all were terrible.

And I found myself doing that so much. And I'm like, this is a shitty way of doing this. This is a discovery method nightmare. So I mean, the game has many flaws. Yeah, it's just the way the Nintendo designs games is different. And I feel like this is a perfect example of a lot of that. Um, but the good stuff's in there. You just got to avoid the the bad stuff. Sure. And I I don't I don't want that to be the note I leave my impression. Yeah, for sure. Because it's I mean, but I I even came away with the same thing where it's like, yeah, the 100 Mario Challenge is dumb. The 10 Mario Challenge is awesome. But what you were saying about the levels not being unlocked or whatever, it's weird that they did it",

I don't even know. They they go to that the course you you can save anytime you play a level, you can save it. Uh huh. So once you play it like find there's I I don't there that menu we saw it's wherever you save all your your levels. Like you have a your levels thing that you can save them all. And from there you can save world so you can make a whole game with it. You can like name the levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 and then have a World 1 folder and then it goes in there. And so then you can make the whole game. Um, what really got me though was going online and instantly realizing 99% of these suck ass. Yeah, like that's just but that's people, right? People",

But then when you look at the featured ones and the like featured creators, yeah, did you play around with that at all? I went to I mean, I went to the most popular whatever they were at the time and they were all like the shit Rube Goldberg machine. And I was like, all right, well, this isn't even a Mario level. So well, that's the thing. The biggest thing going on right now is people make these elaborate levels, don't touch anything and you start you just move around and like Mo Springs are bouncing them around and stuff. So it's like you don't need play at all. It just kind of bounces into the level. It looks really cool, but you can just watch a YouTube video of it, you know what I mean?

It looks really cool, but you can just watch a YouTube video of it, you know what I mean? Like you don't need the game for this. But what's cool about that is the the the level design, you know what I mean? Seeing that and as that's my first that's what my brain kind of goes to is like, oh, make a level where you just start and then you slide and that's it. And then everything else is just taken care of by the person. That's that's what it is. But then they add all these like crazy hazards so it looks like he's in a lot of danger, but like it's not because it's a predetermined physics thing, right? And what's cool about that though, like watching them, it's like, oh, this is dumb because that's all it is. But it's like then start to understand on a deep level the like the limitations of the game and how the game works and the cool things you can do. So then when you you make your own levels, it's like, all right, that pushed him",

And you see that being put into some of the like expertly created levels in the the featured thing. So the way they have it set up, it's like there's different playlists of of things and all the popular ones are those Rube Goldberg things. But the uh which by the way, what's this who is that guy? How come he get machines that never it was like an art style of machines that never that have constant motion. Yeah, okay. Because he gets a lot of credit for this shit. He deserves it because he good good for him. Um, but then there's the the ones that I got really into was the featured creators because then you go to them, they have their different styles and stuff.

You you just make really good everyone it and uh it's cool because there's like a bunch of guys up there that I was like, I'm like bookmark this. I'm going to like keep going back to this guy because they make that easy. That was our thing. I favored at all our friends and I've gone back and Ducker's made more and Jeff's made more. Oh, okay. So it's like it's definitely a community thing and it's definitely a game that's going to grow over time. Like you, I have no interest in making levels myself. Like it's just not my interest. I would love to mess around, make some stuff with Nick and then just have us play, you know, it's going to be very phallic.

Because I'd like to make just a giant penis with the mushrooms and you can only get a few of them, you know, you can't get the you make mushroom sit. I mean, Mike Ducker spelled that fart and coins perfect. Then I'll do coins. I'll do a big Co no, you do. I mean, like that was the thing, you know, the reference to what I was saying too is like, you know, my favorite thing and what I was so stoked about is I wanted to play everything in the Mario World, you know, lens and that's not unlocked at the get. I guess that's one of my things I got to get as I go through when you make the levels Mario World. Oh, you want to do it Mario World style? Yeah, yeah, but like so",

I was playing this in on Friday infancy of what's happening. So don't get me wrong. I'm like rushing it off that it's all garbage. I know creal is the C top. You never eat a pig because a pig is a cop. Better yet, a Terminator. Yeah, trying to play me out as if my name was Sega, but I ain't going out like no punk. Shit, that was good though. Damn, you know too many lyrics, dude. He know we were I was playing shit uh Genesis yesterday. I was like, I'm in this big Genesis kick right now. I thought you meant playing Genesis.

Yeah, but no, I mean, I'm I know that there's going to be more and there's going to be better and like, you know what I mean? Like and that's that was what was so amazing is the levels we did find that were awesome. The level where you know, you start off as Zero Suit Samus and then you get the power up and you're in the Metroid Suit and you're running. I'm like, this is shit awesome. And I was like, I kept trying to shoot and I couldn't shoot. And I was like, oh, that sucks. But I'm like, somebody's going to figure this out soon enough with Fireballs to make well, so that's that's what's interesting. I do think it's a big problem of how much crap there is",

But when you look at the featured Creator stuff and the things they're doing with all that Amiibo support and the fact that the Amiibo support you don't even need the Amiibos. You unlock the stuff through the game and it's just like there's like hell of characters. Any Nintendo character is playable in this game and that's amazing. And to see the things that people are doing, I was playing a Mario Kart level because Mario like Mario in the cart is one of the things with all the sound effects and stuff. And it's just a level that's based on like, um, using the um, like what are those things called? They're like escalators, like treadmills, treadmills. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Then playing like Metroid levels or playing Donkey Kong levels where you're Donkey Kong and there's Vines everywhere. And it's just like, man, these shits are remaking Mario 64 levels in 2D. And that was the thing when they announced it of like, I I've already lived this with LittleBigPlanet where they put out LittleBigPlanet and there was a bunch of crap and then people started getting the feel for it and then they started breaking it and expanding it in the way of like where LittleBigPlanet 3 was, all right, let's make you can make games, right?

That's why it's exciting and why I I will like I'm talking about it. I have itched to go back today on Kinda Funny Games Live, right? Uh somebody in the chat was like, you should play one of our my levels. And I was like, oh yeah, maybe we will. And then they sent over the thread from KindaFunny.com forums where all the best friends have posted it. And I'm like, this is a Let's Play Series right here. If not a, you know what I mean? Like I we're doing Let's Plays tomorrow. Let's do it. And then if we don't do them all, let's do stream, you know what I mean? Like I'd rather play the stuff from people I know. Yeah, no, definitely.

Yeah, it's definitely something special. And beyond that stuff, like the I'm a Mario nerd. I love all the the Mario games and I can tell you the differences between them and like the physics and like why it feels different or whatever. And I love that this game did that because early on it was just Mario Maker or Super which one is it now? It was just it was just Mario Mario Maker. Yeah, and you could switch between the the play uh original Mario or New Super Mario U whatever, but it didn't change the physics and it didn't add all the different types of jump. So now it actually feels like those different games. So now Mario 1 feels like 1, 3 feels like 3. It has different jump arcs",

So it's like the levels aren't just it's not just the way it looks, it's the gameplay is different. Yeah, and that was what was weird. Can you still switch between them on the fly or no? You can switch between them, but there's some limitations and some things don't exist in the the other stuff. I think some levels seem like they lock it, right? Because when we were playing Miles' level from Rooster Teeth, uh Christine started and died and then I did it and I died a little bit later and she came back and tried to pick up a turtle shell and died. And I was like, I don't think you can do it in this version of the game. And Miles tweeted back at us because he was watching. He's like, yeah, you can't. That's the whole reason I",

So Mario 1, you can't pick up the turtle shell, but you can in the other ones. But Mario 1's the only one that has the Amiibo support and like the different uh Sprites and characters and stuff. And it's just it's cool the the rules within each of those different things. Now as a super hardcore like nerd dude that loves the the history of this stuff, they went back and they added stuff that wasn't in the original games in the style of the original games. So like the original Super Mario didn't have Boos, the the ghosts, but now it does. Or Chain Chomps, but they did them in the 8-bit style of Mario 1. Or there was no Ghost House levels in Mario 1. Now there's a Ghost House with its own soundtrack that is similar in",

Or Super Mario World never had an Airship, but it has a Super Mario World sounding Airship song. And it's just like these little things. I'm like, holy shit, like there was so much thought put into it. Now are there people actually making like games, like designing levels to a point where you would actually like this is a like 20 levels makes a game? This is where my bigger critique of the game into play. And I think a lot of people are mad about this and it's It's upsetting when you think like initially, but I think then later when you realize what this game is, this game isn't about making a game. Sure. It's about making levels. And that is really determined by the fact that there's not checkpoints in in this. You can't put a",

Like those levels were huge with all these sprawling paths and stuff because halfway through you could, you know, right, whatever. And then games are designed where the game over levels teaches you mechanics so that you know how to use them in the the harder levels, right? This game isn't made for that because the levels can only be so long. Even if you have like doors and warp pipes and stuff, they can only be so long and there's no checkpoints. So they they don't have enough time to teach you how to use the different mechanics in one level, right? Right. So what this game I so you're saying like progression is just a little it's too hard given the tools. Yeah, and I mean, people are going to do it. People are definitely they already",

But I think that that's almost mis I mean, you can do whatever you want, but like I feel like that's misusing this tool set because this and playing the Mario uh 10 Mario Challenge really kind of propels this as a theory where it's supposed to be each level is supposed to be a small challenge. Like each level is supposed to you need to learn how to beat the level and beat the level and overcome the ch in that one contained thing. Mario 10 is in this almost sounds like a knock, but it's not like it's like WarioWare, right? In the way of like, hey, here's this what the big challenge you're dying at is the big challenge of the game. It's not like you're going to get past it and hav have another huge thing. Exactly.",

It's not like you're going to get past it and hav have another huge thing. Exactly. And so that's the thing is it's like I was playing it. I played through like four or five rounds last night of the 10 Mario thing. And every time it's different levels and a lot of them are remixes of old existing levels, but with one real big challenge in it. And so it's like that challenge is the challenge and then you beat that, move on to the next level. And for me, it's a little offputting because it's like I want that Mario experience of like beating the game. You don't beat this game. You just beat levels. Yeah, you know, this feels like uh and from what I noticed from all the the marketing material from from this right off the gecko, I was like, this feels a lot like like a Mario version of LittleBigPlanet.
