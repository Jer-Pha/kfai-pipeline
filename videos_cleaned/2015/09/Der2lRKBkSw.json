As always, I'm Tim Gettys, joined by the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty, and the return of Greg Miller. I'm back to write the ship. The return. Oh my God, saw the comments. Nick Scarpino is in here farting up the joint talking about Axiom Verge this, Axiom Verge that. All four topic one, I played power of Dying Light. I know a lot. Mhm. It was, I mean, that was one topic and then three of them were Axiom Verge, so it was good. It was a good show. People did want you back, so I'm happy that you're here. I'm, I'm, I'm sorry I was, I'm sorry I was gone. Your hair, you need to, you need to do a little something. Thanks, Kevin, way to be on the ball about that. I like it that way. Oh, thank you, Kev.

We got the poster here. We've been talking about it a lot. Have you got to play it yet? No. Okay, because Mr. Bethl, well, actually I played it. I put a Let's Play up on PC. Yes, but of course PC, come on. Why don't I just play it on my ColecoVision? You know what I mean? I want to play it on the ultimate platform, the PlayStation Vita. But Mike Bethl, very forthcoming, said it's not quite there yet. Put it out on PS4. It's still Cross-Buy, cross, yeah, that's the thing. It's on, it's on PlayStation 4, coming to PS Vita, PC, and Mac.

I, I fought the urge to play it on PlayStation 4, but mainly the urge was easy to fight because I came back with Metal Gear, and so it's just like if I'm turning on the PlayStation 4, Metal Gear has my soul. Mhm. But this is inspired by Metal Gear. And oh, right. No, no, again, I'm totally into Volume. I'm totally down with Volume. I just need to platinum Metal Gear first. I get it. Totally get it. And then once it comes on the Vita, you'll get in there, you'll platinum that. Everything will be good. It's going to be a glorious, glorious time.

I know you guys haven't played it, so if you need, you want to know, you let me know. Uh, Until Dawn, do I see boobs? No. What? Uh, I only asked 'cause it's a teen horror movie. Yeah, exactly. That's a little upset. You get pretty close. I, that's all matters. Do I see a dick? No. I've played Dick. I've played through it two times, one and a half times.

Um, nickel. So uh, Until Dawn is a PlayStation 4 exclusive from Supermassive Games. It's been in development for a very long time. Uh, it was originally a PS3 game that was uh, using PlayStation Move. And if you go look at the old trailers for it, the game looks markedly different. Um, one of the things that came up on Colin & Greg Live today about Until Dawn that I, I was loath to, to mention at the top is that I think Until Dawn might be PlayStation 4's most beautiful game. Burn. Um, and uh, it's not, it's not, it's consistent. There's like some uncanny valley **** going on in it with some of the characters sometimes, especially one",

Hayden Panettiere is in this game, so you already know what Hayden Panettiere looks like. So to see the digital version of her, weird, maybe doesn't match up with exactly. Um, that said, I feel like the character, so there's interstitial scenes, and I don't want to get too into that, in between the chapters that look real. There, there's a character you meet that you've never seen before in any of the trailers. Um, and there's all this, there's these scenes with this particular character, and it looks **** real, real. So I just want, I want to put that out there. I was like, I couldn't believe how good it looked. But just the lighting, the environments and stuff, it's just a very pretty game.

Um, and it all runs, it's running on the Killzone Shadow Fall engine. And uh, from uh, Guerrilla. And it just looks really, really pretty. So I just want to throw that out there really quick because I think that's an understated thing. I think the game is gorgeous. Um, I played it and I was shocked by good it is. Uh, I think it's a great game. It's one of my favorite games of the year by far. Um, it's, there's nothing like it on the market. It is an adventure game. It's, if you, if you're a PlayStation fan, you know Quantic Dream games pretty well. Think Quantic Dream, but think in terms of Beyond: Two Souls, anyway, way better. Um, and uh, not as good. It's, it's comparable, I think, in quality to Heavy Rain. It's just that",

Um, it's serious in the moment, but it's, it's full of tropes and horror movie tropes and stuff like that. It's about eight kids uh, that go, and I'm not spoiling anything because this, if you really don't want to know anything about Until Dawn, you should just not watch this video. Um, and I respect that completely. It takes place, it starts a year before the events. And this is what we played in our Let's Play. The, the, the, the tutorial is about, the tutorial of the game shows how these two girls, these twin girls die. Oh, okay. And uh, they are all up at this cabin. Um, there's eight kids plus the two girls, so there's 10 of them. And the eight kids play a prank, or some of the kids play a prank on one of the, the girls, thinking that one of the",

She runs out of the house into the snow, and her sister runs after her. And it's a bad, and it's teaching you how to play the game basically at this point. And um, the both, no matter what you do, the girls are going to die. And that's why it's not really a spoiler. It's just, it is what it is. From that point on, every choice you make in the game really does have consequence. And there's, and there's different layers and levels of consequence in the choices you make. Um, so the game chronicles each of these eight characters. You play as all of them at different times. And it chronicles relationships with each other. So it measures like how, like how you're doing with other people. It measures like your own statistics in terms of like your",

It measures like your own statistics in terms of like your honesty, your courage, your intelligence, all that kind of stuff based on the choices you make. And then there's these overarching things called The Butterfly Effect, uh, which is a real thing, um, that are tracked based on the choices you make. So let's say like when, when you make a really super consequential choice, not just like a choice that's like secondary to the story, but a really important one, a butterfly icon appears on the screen. And then you can go into the, into the menu and look, and it'll say like, you know, Mike did this, therefore, and then like, you don't know what happened yet. And, and, and there's a bunch of these kinds of sequences. So the beauty of the game is that my first question, sure, of course.

So like you can see like it said it, whatever you're line through to the end of it on Mike's story or whatever is there. But then you see that if you make the choice here, then it starts filling another one. But can you still see the, the old choices? It's unclear. Okay. Because so when you, when you beat the game, you can go back into different chapters and start, and start, it's, it's actually a lot like Heavy Rain in the sense that like from the moment you start, it'll, it'll probably presumably erase everything going forward. Sure, sure, sure. And you go chapter by chapter. I played through all the way again, and then I just deleted that data, and I play it again. Gotcha.

Why are you in this cabin at all? Because basically, and I'm sorry, I'm jumping around. I wasn't really prepared to talk about it uh, so in depth, and I do apologize about that. But um, the story after the girls die takes place a year later, and everyone goes back to the cabin. And it's, and it's a way for them to like kind of, it's totally silly. I like, why would you go back? But there, I love this though. I mean, this sounds so good. This sounds exactly like those stupid 90s slasher movies. Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

And the chapters can take anywhere, depending on the choices you make, from 15 to 30 minutes to like over an hour. Um, the game took me, I mean, you're not literally asking. I want to say the game took about eight hours to beat. Um, but what I'm asking, so you kind of already answered this, but that eight hours, like with those type of movies, we don't need them to be two hours long, you know what I mean? Like those movies could be hour, 10 minutes in and out, and it's like you got what you needed. Do those eight hours feel like they should for that type of those movies?

Rosemary's Baby is a **** perfect example of a horror movie that is **** awesome until five minutes before the end, you know? So it's not like they have a hard time wrapping these things up. And I don't think this movie is necessarily immune to that. The brilliance, as I'll get to in a minute, is that the, the game can end a million different ways depending on the choice you made. Um, so you, the eight kids go back, the eight surviving kids go back, is a way to like kind of celebrate and remember these kids and stuff. And it's snowy.

Um, they all go back. And the reason it's so long, you're talking about, you know, 90 minutes is a good length, or two hours maybe for a horror movie. The reason it's eight hours is because you get to play as all of the characters, and they all have their own thing going on.

Each chapter take, each chapter will show you most of the characters, not all the characters, doing things concurrent to each other. Cool. So it's not, so chapter one is like, and, and each chapter is like, so chapter one is 10 hours Until Dawn. Chapter two is nine hours Until Dawn. Chapter three is eight hours Until Dawn, et cetera, and so on. What chapter do they go, okay, let's split up? Uh, moment two, they split up almost immediately. Classic. Um, but it like, you're split up almost immediately. Like they're all coming up the mountain separately. Like, and, and all this kind of stuff.

If you make a choice, someone's going to die, or something's going to happen, but it's, it's permanent. And so there's no way to **** the game up. Okay? Like the, the choices you make are the choices you make, and you can't go back and erase them. Um, the game saves often.

And, and I was like, I was like, huh. So like these relationships seem to have, whether they're attention, I'm tapping. So whether these, these, whether these in are tangential or not, I don't know. Sure. But it seems like there was some consequence based on just little things I was, I was doing. Of course, the Butterfly Effect choices are the most",

Of course, the Butterfly Effect choices are the most major ones of all, right? But there's little, the, the, the relationships you have with each other, um, seem to affect the way you play the game. There's another thing that affects the way you play the game. There are multiple different kinds of collectibles, and I love collectibles. There are things called totems that you find. Totems are, there's five different types of totems, and they show you the future. Um, when you look at them, and only like little glimpses of the future. So you can see a possible way you're going to die, a possible way you can save someone, a choice you can make. But these are all hypotheticals based on what happened so far in the game. Wait, is that like, do they show you the player, or do like, they show the character? So they like show if I'm Mike and I'm picking up a totem, it might show",

No, like it doesn't, it doesn't, me as like the PlayStation, I turn on, show Colin like a **** rock hitting that. No, I like, is this a story? It doesn't seem like he's aware. They don't react to the totem. Okay, okay, interesting, interesting. But then there are clues you find. You can find pictures and all sorts of things, like paperwork, all sorts of stuff. And you know, I was talking to my friend Alexa, we all know Alexa from GameSpot. She reviewed the game for them, and she was saying that she had played through once not finding anything, like intentionally, like not, and, and it affects the players, the, the, the kids' understanding of what's happening.
