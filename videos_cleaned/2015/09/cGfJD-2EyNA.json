Mhm mhm. All right, so here's the thing, you you've done a couple warm-up rounds. This isn't the Alf I'm used to seeing, the veteran. The game flows differently. See, take a lot you used to, but what you're still winning though, so I want to I want to see this. I want to see you come through with the magic on this one. Show off what that Halo multiplayer goodness is all about. I'm going to try. So what I noticed is the key to your success is the sniper rifle. We see we got to wait for it to spawn. You get it and then you dominate. Then you dominate for Kinda Funny. Wait for the sniper rifle to come back up. Oh, all right, cool. I don't know what grenade that was, but I liked it. All right, off to a good start, off to a good start. Thought I got picked up a snipe, but I'm going to go ahead and just kind of try and defend him. I'm",

We're rooting for you. Uh oh, oh, oh, someone behind me. You need to know whenever you come from behind on somebody, they're going to come. Someone's right behind you. Mhm. Tit for tat, you know what I'm saying? I don't know, that sounded a lot dirtier than I meant it. I meant it dirty, but I didn't mean it to sound that dirty. Nip for nip. Uh oh, got Sean Finian over there, pistol, the pistol. He's so funny, he thinks he has a chance. He doesn't. Oh my God. All right, so we're out there. Want that snipe drop again? That'd be that'd be nice. That's all you need. Hang out this guy, 'cause once you got the snipy, it's blouses. Oh, I like that side step. The Protector, you know what I mean? Mhm.

He likes hiking, you know, man. Let's recharge. Someone's over here somewhere. Yep. You guys are off for a good lead right now. We are. We're doing well. I'm feeling good. We're dominating. Okay, okay. He's going to come back ready. He's shooting you with some that yellow goodness. Oh man, Tim, that guy's going to get demolished. He is down there. You want to jump team? Mean no, teammate's about to wreck him. Oh, or not. Snipes up in 13. I love when we're just just play like these casual games. Alf just starts like jumping into all of this like Snipes 13. Here we go. Okay, no, we did a lot of shit talking. I you did a lot of shit talk. I know, but you know what happens when you talk shit?",

Still getting used to how this game flows though. Looks like it's owning well for you. Oh, oh God. Yeah, you made a good call. Oh shit. Oh, just barely going to pick up the snipe. I should have flocked towards my team. It's all good. It's all good. It's all good. You're still owning the lead. 39. It's very interesting now how they actually call out power weapons and stuff. Yeah, that seems like it would really change the dynamic of the gameplay. I'm pretty sure they picked up that. Oh, that guy, he don't know what the pistol. So it does work. Oh God, that's that do my sniper rifle. You don't see. Got to do. You got to get it back. Do the crazy Elite with the charge. Not even he need.",

Oh my God, my whole teammate is going to blame me out. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Back in business. All right, there's a lot of firepower going in there. Oh, careful. Oh, I was going to try and dodge. You're getting a little too nifty. It's weird because like I don't feel as fast as I think I am. That's how I live my life. All right, let's it's cool to see you like in your element with this, like in the multiplayer. Like it's just so different than like the campaign, you know?

No, he's not. Oh, Sean Finian running away. You just going to let him go? Let him hike his little heart out. Oh, not going to happen. I hurt. I felt that one in my core. I don't know where the rest of my team is at though. Yes, thank you. AR starts, man. That's so that's so pleb with that BR. It's all about BR starts. Not that I'm good with it, but you know. He's coming from this way. Oh God, careful. Get did I catch that? No, someone else got that. You get some long range engagement, you know what I'm saying? Oh, a damn.

I got to find what sense I like. Is it random if it's a AR or BR start? Uh no, it's this is AR starts. Just always. No, I mean, that's how they said it for this match. Well, how come second get BR? Are you just near one? Uh I was near one. Okay. H the melee is shorter. He just got punched in the head. I I've I've been playing a lot of different games, so I'm trying I'm trying to trying to wrap your head around. I'm trying to wrap my head around like the little changes like melee so much shorter.

See, it's party time. I told you. No, I'm I'm trying to get us to these. I want you to get the final kill. Make it dramatic for us. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, he did the the dash.

Not bad. Yeah, look at you. You look so cool. Definitely fun, but like I said, things like the dashing, the uh the movement takes them getting used to.
