That's that's a perfect one. And Nick, what how do you feel about this? How do I feel about the perfect DLC? What is the perfect DLC for you? No DLC, really. I don't want it. I don't I don't I once I'm done, like I finished Arkham. I saw the 1989 Bat Suit. I saw the Batmobile from the from the Tim Burton movie. I was like, that looks cool. Why won't you give them the $4 or whatever? They I'm already done with the game. I beat the game for sure. You don't get I think as into like I don't get this way about every game. There are those specific like The Witcher, super excited about those expansion packs. I know nothing about. I'm this is piggybacking this. I'm bringing this topic up because of just as why I'm putting it into our popular mindset right now. Uh, today the whole Dragon Age: Inquisition thing, the DLC Trespasser was years later.

That's new. I never seen right from certain doom. What have you done for them lately? Find out September 8th, Trespasser, a downloadable epilog for Dragon Age: Inquisition that picks up two years after the main story ends. What happens to the world-saving organization when the world no longer needs saving? That's the theme being explored, a Trespasser, the final single-player DLC for BioWare's role-playing epic game. And then it goes DA. I'm excited. This is also today they announced Uncharted, uh, release date March 13th, 18th. I thought, damn it, you're probably right. I'm bad at that stuff.

Every **** time this couples together in these game, something horrible's happened. Can they just be happy together? Can we open up and they're happy, Nick? They don't lie to each other. I don't lie to my wife about anything. It scares her. My wife has this new thing. She's like that she asked me this question. She's like, do I need to be worried about this? I'm like, no, no, no, 'cause I'll let her know if she has to be worried about anything ever. What what have you told her about before?

That's how I like my entertainment because of movies, because of TV, because of film. Even when I watch a TV show or like a 30-minute like, uh, episodic show, I'll watch like four of them and then I'm done. Like, I got to go on something else. My my brain doesn't have the attention.

So let's take let's take Dragon Age, right? Um, how long how much how many hours approximate did you think you put into that? The thing series, the game clock, I think was around 100 hours. However, I stopped and restarted to get my character right about 10 times. And I played I mean, I like played a few hours of each of those characters before I realized I didn't like them. And real quick, what's your Guild Wars game clock at? 1100 hours. Holy ****. Holy ****. How many hours are in a year? Can someone tell us in the comments?

So I'm not I cannot I have no leg to stand on as far as I love Psych, right? But I'm not I'm not judging you for how you choose to spend your time. It's just for me, I get like like we were talking about Deus Ex earlier, right? They announced uh pre-order campaign, pre-order, augment your pre-order. You see this today sort of on the on your chat, but I could total marketing move of like, yeah, you pre-order the game and you get one. You can pick from you're in tier one already then.

It's percentage based, not not they're not they're showing the so it's got to be like I guarantee they're going to hit that pre-order number, but I guarantee three days beforehand before the cut off, they're going to be like, we're so close. Everybody pre-order, please. And going to like and then regardless of whether or not people actually pre-order, they'll just artificially bump those numbers up. Well, we don't know the numbers. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, they're controlling percent. You can be like, whoa, oh, just magically went to 100%. Good job, everybody. But you were saying, yeah, you want to play that game.

Like I leave for two weeks or three weeks to go to Vegas and TwitchCon and PAX and you know, all these other things that are happening. And I come back and I'm like, all right, I know my character is Adam Jensen. What the **** am I doing? What was I supposed to? The thing that they've started doing in games now, The Witcher did this and it was annoying as hell for me because I was playing it all at once, right? So it it started to pissing me off, but I could I understand why they did it is they basically do a recap literally every time you load into a different area. Oh, that's smart.

They had screen they had a screen be like, Scarecrow's doing such and such. Go check out the thing that people are starting to work in, especially for the longer experiences, 'cause they know like if you it's hard to keep track of what's going on the moment you put a game down. Like it's I feel like the how many this this is an issue. I Catherine Catherine trying to pick Catherine back out after a week off. I Mass Effect 2 tried to pick that up.

But you know, there was a complaint that Colin had with The Witcher was that he he loved it, but there was too many. He felt like he was constantly being bombarded by side. But here's the problem with Colin is that and he said this, so I'm not talking ****, but he get shot. He was like, I have to get every side quest done before is not how you play that game at all. You do not level up that way. You don't get it really that much more entertainment. Like it's just that's not how you play the game. The side quest you're supposed to just sprinkle in along the way.

You were like, because I did it properly, which is that I wasn't trying to do all the side quests at once. I was doing them as I went along, so it didn't feel as like, you know, as consuming looking at a list of side quest going, ****, I have to do everything before I can move on. Same with Dying Light, right? At Dying Light, I'm like, ah, this cool. I'm really getting into this. I'm like, I'm loving up a little bit and this is great.

It's just like dudes coming out to you and be like, hey, bro, you got some free time. Help me **** move. I'm like, no, I don't want to help you move. I got to slay these zombies, man. Like, no, man. Some guys give a gun. **** sell a gun. Uh, I mean, I haven't played The Witcher, so I don't know. But I mean, it was the same for me. It's the same with me for that.

Put new trophies in, but it's all multiplayer. I'm just like, that's not what I care about. Batman did it. They used to do it with challenge maps and they still do, but then they did Batgirl this time around that. And when they said that, that's when I was like, here's my season. I'll buy the season pass up front. I want that. Plus, you're talking about more character-driven pieces later on. But I wonder sales numbers on that though. I just I wonder if they choose I mean, first off, they're trying to push the multiplayer because that's what typically people will continue to play.

So I understand them wanting to beef that up and make it more interesting as you I get that's how money's made for them, you know, putting out a new hat or a new gun or a new item or a new map and all stuff because people are still locked into it. But I prefer them to because I think most it's not as bad now. I I'd like to think most multiplayers put in games now because the team wants to make multiplayer games of some kind. But it was for a while where it was, how do we fight trading ****? Put multiplayer in it. And there was so many half-ass home like Tomb Raider, the original Tomb Raider multiplayer.

And that was I mean, maybe that's where it started from, but people really do like that multiplayer. It's good. It's one of the few ones I get into, you know what I mean? I like Mass Effect's multiplayer. I didn't I haven't still haven't played Dragon Age's though. And that's the thing is like I for me to stop me from trading in a game, not that I'm going to trade in any of my games because I most of mine are digital. So yeah, exactly. That's the other point. But like if I was on the outside and you wanted me to stop from it, it's promising story DLC somewhere. Like last when they were like Left Behind. They Left Behind.

And like sometimes it works against them. Like I would have bought Game of Thrones as one. I would given them $60, right? But I played episode one and then episode two came.

Uh, people didn't like the ending, so they have the opportunity to be like, oh, here's something. Oh, we left out these paintings at the end that really explain everything, right? But you know what I mean? Like if I was doing this face, you can't see them. But you also have the opportunity to like, whereas you're watching a film, you're like, oh, that was kind of weird, right? Well, you can update that rightly. You can have someone just go to, you know, you can download something a little easier, a little better, a little cooler. You know, you you have the opportunity to kind of fix the plane while it's still in the air. Uh, with video games, they actually uh updated The Witcher combat, which is pretty interesting. That's interesting. And so that's a perfect example of like that probably made it a lot better, right? They talking about more",

They talking about more of like over the years versus on a single product. Like, you know, taking anything literally. I don't really I'm not that big into movies or TV, so not sure. But Nashville, we love Nashville. We do love Nashville too. What up, Chip? But do you see what I'm saying? Like, have them being like, Oh, we did this TV show and everybody hated the X, Y, and Z about, right? So now when we go pitch this other project, we'll fix those things. Like, no. Yeah, which you get a lot of times. Well, I always say it might be the same in games too. What you get a lot of times in in TV and film is that you get like The Big Bang Theory and then everyone wants to make a Big Bang Theory, right? Like, oh, that's and games do that too. We have all these open world games now. Literally everybody make Facebook game and then that went away. She learned",
