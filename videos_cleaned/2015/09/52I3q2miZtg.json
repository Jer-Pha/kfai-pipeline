Come listen to Colin and I talk about PlayStation games each and every Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames and podcast services around the globe. Greetings and salutations, welcome to Kinda Funny Games. My name is K. Moriarty. This is uh my lifemate, Greg Miller. Greg, today we're going to play Uncharted: Drake's Fortune from the Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection. Oh, I've heard of this collection, which is on PlayStation 4, exclusively on PlayStation 4. Not only does it come with the Uncharted 4 beta pass, but it comes with the three original PS3 Uncharted games. And we're doing this in celebration not only of uh The Nathan Drake Collection, but also to celebrate our brand new PlayStation podcast, PS I Love You XOXO, starting this week. youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. Subscribe so you don't miss it. And then of course, every podcast service as well. Tuesdays, 9:00 a.m. Pacific video. There's no window.",

And we're like, well, you can't. It's just going to be there. We do a lot of stuff on Patreon support. I love that. But uh yeah, so you can watch it on YouTube. You can also download as audio. It's there for you. We want to do it, spiritual successor to what we used to do. It's going to be a lot of fun. Today we're going to play Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. Play, I mean, we're just showing the game. You play it on Normal. I'm playing on Crushing right now. My thought process is if I'm starting this and I want to platinum it one day, do I just, I know I'll just do it Normal. We'll get back into it here. I mean, you're not used to it. I, I, I haven't died yet when my Crushing playthrough, but you're a real man.",

But also because uh, you know, it's worth noting that uh, the game has hasn't really ramped up. There's, this is the hardest of the three Uncharted games by a mile. Oh yeah, sure. Naughty Dog didn't have the balance just yet. And now that's what I want to talk about with this and every one of these Let's Plays we'll do this week as we, I mean, what a great timing that the Uncharted Collection embargo lifts the week we do PS I Love You XOXO. As if we planned this. But I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, we don't plan anything here. Absolutely not. Uh, what year did Uncharted: Drake's Fortune come out? 2007.

And this is one of the ones people like, oh, I can't wait to see what the guy, the guys who did Jak are going to do next. And we rolled in and I remember picking up the controller and playing it and being like, what the hell is this? You know what I mean? Like it was like so different. It wasn't Jak and Daxter, right? It wasn't that. It was like this very amazing uncanny valley. It looks so, it looks so good. It's funny now that we're going to get into it here. You're going to see how it looks and be like, oh, well, I still think, I mean, this is the thing is, and this is why I'm curious about putting in the original in the might.

The Bluepoint does a shit ton of ports. They're very familiar with Sony and Sony's first-party games. But I feel, I mean, this doesn't look as good as Two or Three and certainly not as good as Four. But it looks better than I remember. It's running in 1080, 60 frames a second for me. The funny thing about it is the way they have it set up, like when Elena is walking around the camera right there and stuff that you can, this looks even, this still looks like the map set they always show, right? Where it's so bare bones. Like as Uncharted ramps up and we'll see it as we do Let's Plays for Two and Three as well, you'll just see how more, how much more detail is put into these environments to make them more flesh out.

You can imagine, you know, Emily Rose and Nolan North in the ping-pong ball suits with all the stuff around them trying to figure out. Absolutely. You'll, you'll see later when it pans out in about five minutes or so after you spoil or fight the pirates. Uh, the ocean looks really like you could tell they just use the same like texture over and over again. But it's, and that's why people were so intrigued by Among Thieves, which is Uncharted 2, which we'll play if you're watching this the day this came out. We'll play that tomorrow.

How you and I think Three is the better game, but everybody else thinks it's Two. And we always talk to people, if you were to switch them around and Three came out before Two, everyone would say Three is better than Two. Yeah, absolutely. It's not only us saying that. Like when I did the history of Naughty Dog when we were still at IGN, that's what they said. A lot of them said the same thing that they swear, you know, and they really feel that if Three came out before Two, people would feel the same exact way about that game. I think Three was extraordinary. Also, real quick before we lose it, side of it, Ottsel on their suits. Obviously, Easter egg back to Jak and Daxter, cuz you know, Daxter was indeed, indeed.

I've killed 10 people with explosive, explosive. Oh, I didn't see. There's all these little things that pop up like these meta games that are available. See if down here. Ah, get out of the way. God, I'm going to fall in love with you one day, but I can't deal with it now. Now it's also interesting that uh R1 is not shoot anymore. No, it's, you can change it.

Um, the camera just doesn't feel like where it should be for a shooter, let alone Uncharted. Yeah, I mean, it's it's a little, it's a little antiquated, I think. You know, there's only so many things that you could truly fix. I don't know if people are going to have a huge problem with it. I don't think it would be a huge problem. I just think it's interesting. Used to it. This is going, we always talk about going, you know, the big thing lately has been Metal Gear, right? Going back in time and playing Metal Gear 1, right?

That happened. That guy had no uh, no spine. How? I mean, that's just how hard Nate punches. He punches you so hard he liquefies your spine. Yeah, you're right though about like the dist, like the the draw distance is great, but there's just nothing around. Like it's definitely not as detailed. But I mean, for the time that this came out, this was a beautiful. Oh my God. And that's what I'm trying, and that's what it's interesting. I'm trying to put in context for people, right?

And playing this in like, it was a different level, right? It was so amazing what it was doing. Sully's going to come in. It's so cool cuz we have all this context of these characters now and Sully. Like we haven't even met Sully yet. Yeah. Uh, we don't know anything about these characters.

So this came out uh, Fall 2007. So that was like a year after PS3 came out. Yeah. So think about the games we got a year after PS4 came out. And then think about what they did with Uncharted 3 and The Last of Us on the same hardware. The amount of power they extracted. Amazing. I think it's going to be extreme. Like what we see, I mean, Uncharted 4 already is ridiculous, but it's going to get better than that. Yeah. By the time we get to the end of the life cycle of the PS4, you can only imagine what people are getting out of it. You look back at this and it'll look like what a PS1 game looked like, right?

Okay, so you want, so so you'd want to be married to, so you'd want to be married to Elena in real life? Sure. If she could come out of the game world and live with us here in her journal.
