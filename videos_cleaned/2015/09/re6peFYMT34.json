This but they did similarish. Is it a lightning mobile version? Pokemon, isn't it? Ring ring. Let me check the phone. Yeah it's truth calling for you Tim. You better take good. All right, so um what's funny about that though is the uh Square Enix Montreal Nick Nick Verge who's the **** homie he made a image of Laura versus like Pokemon and like in the Pokemon Go stuff and it funny. So obviously Pokemon's not made by Square. No. Okay, so Pokemon Go is a new game that they announced to kind of uh I mean it's not the it's not for the 0th anniversary of Pokemon but it will release during the 0th anniversary of Pokemon. I have a feeling they're going to do something as well to celebrate that. But it is a augmented reality game for mobile phones. So this is Nintendo's like real big first step into mobile games",

Um, it's a company called Niantic. N I A N T I C. They were owned by Google for a while and now they're not. They're here in San Francisco. Yes. And so they're doing stuff like with Nintendo. They're making this Pokemon game and it is a it's a mobile game where you catch Pokemon in real life. So it's one of those that uses your camera and you kind of look around the environment. Oh, there's Pikachu and Pikachu's out there trying to score on the side. Okay. So, not much is known about this. Right now, there's been one trailer for it and it blew the internet the **** up.

Starring me as Pikachu. I like that. Pikachu Pikachu doesn't go in the ball. But so the thing with this though is that the trailer they released is is really like 14 million views on on a a video game trailer thing is like that's big for a mobile game like that doesn't have Kate Upton on a horse. Exactly. Right. So the trailer it was like 3 minutes long and it was so amazing. It's just it started very stylized. A lot of like big white text on the screen and it's like imagine if Pokemon was in real life. It almost made it look like like a heads up display or something.

Okay, so that's the thing is like you look at this and as gamers we all are instantly like, \"All right, what's the gameplay?\" You know, cuz this this is the equivalent of something even worse than a CG cut scene trailer. You know, this is people in real life doing **** Like you see people like throwing balls and **** It's like you're not really going to be **** doing that. Um, but you see the trailer is just like adults walking around and they'll like pull out their phone and like there'll be like a map of where they're at and you see there's a Pikachu nearby and you look and then he uses his camera and he's all like doing his thing and then like in",

So, you and I are on a train. Our our before we blow Nick's mind, our phones let us know that we're close and we're like, \"Oh, we accept battle. We battle.\" Then the third part is yeah there's these like events like MMO events raid party kind of things that happens. Now this is all happening on your phone of course. Yeah.

I mean, do you know anything about No idea what the **** Ingress is? Have you ever heard of it? No. Okay. I've heard of it before. It's a huge thing that like millions of people were playing. I don't They're still playing on the Vita. It was like No no no no no. Uh, it was like 2013. It originally was on Android devices, so like Kevin was playing it with like his friends. **** nerd. Um, but the game has this really really really complex science fiction like backstory thing.

Now, the story of that game, whatever, I don't really know, but the gameplay of it is there's portals that come up and there's different factions that fight over control of the portals. So you kind of become people that you take this side or this side and you go to the portals and like it's like king of the hill but in real life. Now the portals are all based around real world locations. So like the ferry building in in one of the videos is one of the portals. So people will go and like if they check in there then **** happens and you look at your phone like there's like augmented reality **** and all that stuff, right?

There was arrest that happened over this. like this became like a real thing where there's like real money being put into it and like people get obsessed with it and started creating this whole culture where they just created their own ecosystem of like this crazy storyline and it became characters where it's like real life role playing.

It's because so that way there's not kids using their phones walking into the middle of the street looking at Google Maps and **** dying. This thing will just **** tell them what to do. They're still gonna walk. They're still gonna walk in the middle. Well, that's because they're kids in the dumb. I can't wait for it to get monetized is what I keep saying is I can't wait for it to be monet McDonald's which wouldn't. But let's unless a Del Taco buys into it, right? And they just like now you get a **** special Pokemon every time you come in Del Taco kids. Yeah. So Ingress did that. Um but it wasn't so much like buy a thing, it was just go there. Yeah. Go there.

But what's cool is the idea would be depending on where you live there's different Pokemon. So you can't catch them all just where you're at. So that creates it's just like there's so many ideas with this that could be super cool. I believe the first game to do this was Mod Nation Racers on Vita which also gave you unique items if you went in and used near around like the Statue of Liberty or the Eiffel Tower. I never did it cuz nobody understood near but that could happen. Also, Mod Nation Racers on Vita was a disappointment and really hurt my feelings.

Hey everybody, Kayman here to tell you what Ingress is all about. No, it wasn't that. Um, but it's one of those things where I mean I'm not super into it, but I can understand people getting lost in this.
