We did a little bit of this this little game called Halo 5, and it it was very interesting. We did three different modes. We did campaign, we did Arena, which is multiplayer, and then Warzone. And we have Let's Plays of them going up all this week. I don't know when you're listening to this, but by the time you listen to this, everything will be up except for Warzone, which is the one thing we're not allowed to talk about. Don't you talk about Warzone, of course. No Warzone impressions yet, but if you want them, check them out at the Let's Play that goes live on the Monday, which would be September 30 something. My question begins, yes, how good was Alfredo? Did he school everybody else? Did he make every like a fool? No, he didn't. No, so here's the thing though, it's just like during this, I mean, they're still tweaking the the the aiming and stuff. It felt, I don't even know you anymore. I don't even know you, Alfredo.",

Here's what's interesting, and um, I I really do think that this it was less uh them fixing the game and tweaking stuff, and it was more just the situation in which we were playing. Uh, like I think the TVs just weren't properly. Some lags there. There there was lag. There was there was stuff because all the people we knew, Alfredo, and just other people that we knew over like, hey, does this feel a little weird to you? He's like, yeah, I yeah, not in game mode or something maybe. I mean, that's kind of what it looked like watching him, 'cause I was like shocked at watching Alfredo, and he wasn't just destroying, 'cause I've seen him that even just playing campaign.

When's the last time you played Halo? Nice. Been forever, right? Yeah, for sure. Like Master Chief Collection last year, and that was like a false start. Like, you know, whatever thing where like you go over to your friend's house, like you have your I have a monitor I play on, you know what I mean?

But that's because I'm way more casual. You are like the the elite of the elite when it comes to first-person shooters. You play them all for hours and hours and hours, so you know the differences. So it's funny that I think that stuff affects you more than it would affect most people. Oh yeah, yeah. Sean and I were sitting there messing with our sensitivity for like hours trying to make sure figure that it was right. But the cool thing was it was Halo, and I I think that just from from watching a lot of it and from watching you play, I thought that it was impressive to see Halo finally next-gen, because this is the first next-gen or whatever this gen Halo game.

And then on top of that, you're used to playing Halo games where especially like way back in like Halo 1, where it's like there was just Master Chief. Now there's like a team of Spartans. There's two teams of Spartans, and they they're opposing each other. And just like, okay, this is this is kind of fresh. This is kind of new, right? Like you don't really see Spartans fighting Spartans. It's kind of weird. And then on top of that, they they they bring back uh Master Chief's team is like from, you know, the book uh Halo: Fall of Reach. Um, so it's like there's there's more to it.

And you know, and like I watched you and my other friends replay that through Normal, Heroic, Legendary, and then Legendary again and again and again. And the co-op and like the Halo campaign and co-op and the difficulties, it's kind of unlike any other first-person shooter that I know of. Like that's an experience people love that, and they that is one of the key things that they they're going into these Halo games for. It's not just the the multiplayer. Yeah, no, I'm hardcore MP, but like when I get Halo, I'm like, I got to get through that story first. Like first things first.

Like like the cre the the the ships and the vehicles and like the the larger I forgot what it was called by. I don't even know what the hell giant giant mech thing. And what was cool is I remember in Halo 2 playing be like, maybe I don't know. Oh, it was Kraken. Yeah, yeah, it was Kraken being like, oh my God, like this is such a grand scale thing. And like, holy ****. And then I remember in Halo 3, you fight it. Like you can you there's like a boss fight with that thing. And it's like, that's **** cool.

And uh then on Master Chief's levels, it reminded me of Halo 1, where there's those moments where where you're just you're going through the corridors and then all of a sudden you're in this much more open arena. Yeah, and the Hunters come out and there's just **** big things. There's that tense moment of like, damn, these guys look like they can **** me up. But then you know how to take them down. You just go behind you, shoot him in the the little orange thing. Yeah, but that's the thing too though, they they they change the mechanic just a little bit.

So you walk in, you see this the Hunter, you see the arena, you're like, I know how to do this. And then you you go to do it, and then it's like, exactly, you throw the plasma to distract him, then you shoot him in the back. But like, he throws the grenade, the guy literally just **** like, what the ****? It's in one of the Let's Plays. You should check it out. I mean, no, I mean, it's it's Halo at its core. And then there's mechanics on top, you know, it's a layer of new mechanics on top of that. And it's yeah, it looks it looks beautiful.

What do you think about that? Mhm. MP awesome. Like I don't know. Like there's there's with the Halo community, there's always this this thing where it's like, I want my like, I want Halo 3 multiplayer. Like just give me that. Like you have the Master Chief Collection for that. It works now finally. But um no, I mean, like the the new next-gen like version of of Halo is is is very interesting. It's very fast-paced. I think it's good. Sprint or what was it called? Yeah, there's Sprint. Like you can you can dash left and right now too. And and you're you're mantling on top of everything. I don't know.

Or like you you're not moving constantly and just as fast and like getting back into the action right away. Um so yeah, no, Halo 5 MP very fast-paced. And it's just it's MP at its core. Like I said, this is Halo core. The guns like the BR shoots like the BR weapons seem very balanced. There's a new mode that I mean, a lot of people know about called Breakout, which is kind of like just 4v4 elimination. You kind of have that like CS like Counter-Strike type of feel to it. Did you get play that? Yeah, was it as good as it sound? Yeah, I play yeah, but play a bunch of times. It's very intense.

I'm going to put all hours into it. I mean, okay, so I think the biggest question is now in in 2015, we have so many first-person shooters. There's there's Destiny, there's Call of Duty, there's Battlefront coming out. Like there's so much things competing for people's time and for first-person shooter fans time. Do you think this is going to be one of those things like Titanfall or something that it kind of comes out and then people stop playing? Or do you think that people will be playing this in a year?

I mean, it's Halo, so you know you're going to get you know you're going to get a solid campaign, you know you're going to get good co-op, you know you're going to get like awesome multiplayer. In terms of whether I think people are going to keep playing it over and over again, people still played the hell out of like previous Halo multiplayer games. I feel like if they have a good um like ranking system, then yeah, that that'll keep people around, you know, for even longer. And if they choose if they choose if 343 choose to support like uh they want to make it last longer, you know what I mean? Put put a uh competitions and stuff like that.

And I I think it could. Um but it's up it's up to them. It's up to them. Yeah, I have I have two questions. Not that not to be just two skeptical questions. Some do. I haven't played Halo since Halo 3, but and I like those games. But my first question is, is there skepticism in the in the community about 343's ability to deliver? Because Master Chief Collection was **** botched. And I think that a lot of people um it reminds me a lot of Evolution with with Driveclub where it's like, I don't care how good the game is now.

And I'll never forget that Evolution did that. Like and going forward, I'll always kind of not trust them because it took them literally a year to fix the game. So and the same thing with 343 where they really just got the game running like many many many months after it came out and like working for everyone. So is there are you skeptical and is there some skepticism within the Halo community that 343 is going to be able to deliver because they're they certainly didn't deliver with Master Chief Collection? I just feel like Master Chief Collection was more than they can actually chew. Like there's just so much that goes into like the UI itself for the Master Chief Collection.

I'm not going to ever go back even though I love those games to death. Um I don't know. It's it's kind of thing where I just I feel like how can you **** this up? Like, you know what I mean? Like it's just you have you're not trying to put all these different games together and then remaster one and then try to make them work cohesively, you know what I mean? With multiplayer maps all together. And like there's just I feel like there's less components. And so it's kind of like, I'm hoping they didn't. Yeah, yeah, that's true. They yeah, and four.

And this kind of goes to maybe what you were saying about platforms and like the resonance of Halo. Is is it me or do people not really seem to care about this game compared to the to compared to the other Halo games? Because like I I'm not involved in that community, but just working at IGN all those years when a Halo game was coming out, it was an event and it was a big deal and people were really really excited about it. And I've noticed almost a lot of diminishing returns with this series since 343 took it over where there doesn't seem to be this palpable excitement about this franchise anymore.

And I don't and I don't I don't see it anymore. You're going to start a fight, Colin. It was a big I don't see it anymore. No, I mean, I don't I don't see Halo as being something that's as big of a skeptical spectacle as it was before. And I think it's I think personally it's because of a couple things. I think the Master Chief Collection like bad taste in people's mouth still. Like that was a huge **** up. Like it was just unplayable for months. And it's just yeah, it's there's no excuse for that.

They just for for a lot of hardcore Halo people, like they're very much like sprints, like dashing, like this isn't Halo. Like I know Halo. So like there's all these new mechanics that a lot of people were just very hesitant to to adopt. So I think that accompanied with the fact that the Master Chief Collection was such trash.
