      "text": "All right so now we're going to jump into Mega Man 6, the final of the six Mega Man games in the anthology on NES for the Mega Man series. We'll watch the intro here as I tell you a little bit about the game. The game didn't come out in the States until early 1994, which is extremely late if you know your Nintendo timeline for consoles. You'll know that uh SNES was out by the time Mega Man 6 came to NES for like 3 years. So, this is a very late game. It's a game that a lot of people played. And Capcom had its concerns about this particular game selling in the west. Uh and so they opted not to publish it here. Uh instead Nintendo published it. They localized it and published it themselves, which is unusual for Mega Man, but it's uh the case. Uh it was still published by Capcom in Japan, though. Um the game has a pretty predictable storyline. It's a very very similar to four and five where Wily is the bad guy, but he is disguised. In this case, as Mr. X, but in the others",

In this case, as Mr. X, but in the others you know we he was blaming uh Dr. Kasik and Dr. or uh Protoman. So uh it's very similar story, similar formula. eight enemies and then you go into two castles. Uh but the impressive thing about this game is we go to Flame Man and start there is that uh it's incredible this game runs on the NES at all. It's it's a very intensive game. The backgrounds are beautiful. The music is fantastic. The the sprites are lively and wellmade. Um it's really cool to kind of see the the the way uh Mega Man had changed um over time if you and that's what's so cool about this Mega Man Legacy Collection that I'm playing these particular let's plays off of is that you get to kind of track the genetic makeup of the Mega Man games.

These oil fields by the way if you let those flaming enemies uh drop their flames on them, they will elite um and then you will have to uh deal with flaming oil underneath your feet, which will kill you instantly if you touch it. So we can just avoid that and we actually just keep climbing up the ladder. These enemies need to be killed with super shots only or the shots will bounce off of them. They also turn into these pads when you step on them, which will get you over the oil. Of course the oil doesn't hurt you if it's not a flame, but it's going to be a flame. Um as you can see here. And if you touch that, it's basically like touching the spikes. It'll just kill you automatically. So we're cruising along here through the oil fields. Fantastic music by the way.

So these flaming enemies that will shoot flames out of their heads will also cause you some problems with these oil fields as well. These um enemies that will rush at you when you're on their platform similar to enemies all over Mega Minions. So let's do away with these guys. There's an E tank down there. Let's grab it from the safety of this flameless oil. I was too slow there so he lit that one up. And this one's going to get lit up by these guys, too. We might as well not even bother with them. And we're already to Flame Man's layer once I can make this jump. Is there a weapon destroyed? There is a weapon. Yeah you can. But I don't have any weapons yet.

You're only seeing one of them right now. There's the other one. And he's a bit of an annoying character to deal with. I'll just use an E tank here to be safe there. This game's E tanks are quite plentiful. Not fighting them too well here, but we're getting through. And it looks like I won't even have how to use that tank so that was a bit of a waste, but we'll have we'll have plenty of E tanks to use uh later on. We'll find more. And we really won't do them on any of the other bosses, the robot masters anyway. So with that uh we get Flame Man's weapon. Uh and we can move on to the next stage will be Blizzard Man's stage. Some pretty cool art here that introduces the flame blast, which is his weapon. And we also get the Rush power",

It's a little bit timeconsuming and a little weird. It changes the way the puzzles work. I'll show you. I won't talk about it. I'll just show you when it's time and you'll see exactly what I mean. So we'll go to Blizzard Man next, who's basically just a skier, which is awesome. really cool design. Um and I'll get into it a little later, but as you may or may not know, I don't know if I explained this in the other let's plays or you might just know this. Um but all the robot masters in all the Mega Man games with the exception of one were created by fans of the series. Um and Inune would then just draw them in the proper style",

Um and Inune would then just draw them in the proper style um to make them all kind of congruent with each other. All of the games had uh design contests run by Capcom um in Japan. So all the enemies the bosses from 3, 4, and 5 were all Japanese. Six was the only example in the series up to this point where the enemies some of the bosses were designed by Westerners. Um specifically Nightman and uh Windman in this game were designed by an American and a Canadian. Um which is pretty cool. And you'll see that in the uh in the ending when we get there. So you can see those shield enemies return. So here we're going to use the flame blast just to get through these barriers, which is pretty cool. We get that E tank to add to our repertoire. And as you can see uh in case it's not evident I am sliding around here. That was bad timing. Oh",

That was bad timing. Oh it's bad timing, too, man. Oh man. I'm getting beat the **** up here badly. Got to recalibrate. So here I'll take the time to show you what I was talking about. Well you go to the power adapter and you can see here I'm not going to let this animation play every time, but Rush combines with Mega Man um and gives him powers. Um so the power the the power module here if I just hold it will destroy these blocks with cracks in them. And that's basically the use of them in this game. Now if I can quickly get out of this and slide under them. There we go. Right to the ladder. That was slick. But I shouldn't be bragging too much since I just got hit like 8,000 times in a pretty bad array here. I'm a little Mega Man fatigued. I got to be honest with you because I've played these games so",

I got to be honest with you because I've played these games so many times. Uh I've had the Legacy Collection for a couple weeks before it even came out. Um and then I've done all these let's plays. So you know I really just wanted to show these games off to you. If I want maybe back maybe in the future I'll I'll start recording what I think are like some really solid like this is how you really play, but it takes time to get those kind of let's plays. So we can destroy these if we want. Just get them out of the way. We don't have to do that. So here because things go up and down I can actually manipulate that. Like his bullets will go up here and then my bullets will actually go down here. And I can try to hit him with them. Try it with a little too close. There we go. And this thing's going up and down. The spikes will kill you of course. So",

And then we'll let it reset and then we can actually sneak in here and get some stuff including some health and then another E tank. And we'll let it go back down. So you can see already how the stages are just way more intense in this game than the others. I think it actually started really with Mega Man 5 when you saw stages like Starman stage and Gravity Man stage, but um it definitely hit the crescendo here. And these things obviously are timers that will explode if you stay on them for too long. So here you can just kind of go over them, use them as platforms. This guy will get in front of and try to kill as quickly as possible. And then we're already to the end. So here you can use these bombs kind of in a strategic way.",

If you go that way and then you jump down here and then you jump on this and then you go like that and then there you go. get through. So Blizzard Man's pretty simple even without the flame blast, but he'll be uh mince meat with it. And he has basically two attacks. He has a an attack uh that uh creates like a blizzard on the screen, shoots some snow at you, and then he curls into a snowball as well. And when he does that attack, he is can't be attacked at all. So you got to just get it kind of get out of his way. corner me there a little bit. And that's the end of him. So Blizzard Man's done. We get the uh Blizzard attack I think is what it's called. All right. So with that we go to Plantman. Now Plantman is by far the silliest designed robot. I don't",

It's actually pretty hard. Um and I actually quite enjoy the stage uh just playing on it. The enemies are kind of unique. There's some really difficult obstacles to deal with later on in the stage. So we can use the power on that if we want to do the power attack, but we're not going to. We'll just continue on. So these guys you kind of just want to avoid. Although they are like damage sponges, but not not so much. But you can just avoid them. It's easier. So sometimes enemies behind you aren't even worth messing with because you can just get them to scroll off the screen if you really wanted to, but they can come back and haunt you.

Kind of like Gutsman meeting a O. So you hit him in the arm to kind of push him back and then you hit him in the eye to do away with him. That was pretty bad showing on my part, but we're surviving and going through. Got these guys be annoying. So get rid of them. A little bit of slowdown. Got to be careful with scrolling these enemies off screen here. You got to be careful not to jump. If you press jump you'll just launch right into those, which is no bueno. And then we'll fight another one of these Guts Dozer type enemies. And he's done. That was way better than the first performance. So here's where things get a little",

So here's where things get a little hairy. You got to like kind of balance how you're jumping. You got to balance all these enemies that are flying all over the place like a bunch of idiots. These platforms can be used if you shoot at them um to kind of avoid obstacles. Oh these of course are health. You want to use them. Let one more pop out. I want to get over zealous with the jumping here. You want to be kind of careful. Draw the fish out. You can get to the corner a little bit more just to make sure you're going to make the jump and then go jump over that guy. Keep on going. The fish is going to pop out here. He's got a high jump. So just keep going. And this gun is on the bouncy things here, which is ridiculous. So I don't know how they even got there. And then we see if we can kind of hop over here",

And then we see if we can kind of hop over here avoid that. And then go. And then we're at Plantman's layer. Now Plantman continues the proud tradition of Mega Man robot masters that use shield or barrier weapons. Um so think Woodman, think Skullman, think Starman, and now think Plantman. Um they all pretty similar identical weapons. Plantman's a bit of a pushover, though. And he's weak not surprisingly to I think this his weakness actually makes a lot of sense cuz he's a plant and you know you're using frost on him. So this is a good place to start if you don't want to start with Flame Man. The reason I start with Flame Man is just to kind of get I just like that stage, but a lot of people start there. It's not terribly uncommon. And then we should be able to do him away with this one. And then plant is finished. Stupid",

Stupid Plantman. And we'll use his weapon. Getting text messages here. Check on those real quick. So we'll get the uh plant barrier from him. Um and then we'll use it on um as you can see here it's not a very impressive weapon, but we'll go to Tomahawk Man and use it on him. And I like I love Tomahawk Man. I think it's really really cool design. We'll go to the restricted area. And here's the first example of a stage. So Mega Man 6 is interesting in the sense that was bad. In the sense that um there are multiple ways to beat certain stages and to beat certain stages properly will net you certain items. Um specifically our friend Beat the bird. But there's more than that because now that we have the jet adapter as well, which I'll show you in a minute um which is the other rush adapter in",

And this is unique pretty much to Mega Man 6. So destroy that enemy. I love that enemy. Really cool. Um and we can continue forward here. I have a charge buster to deal with these guys as they appear so they don't cause any problems and then we cruise up this ladder. There's Eddie again. What does he got for us? Knee tank. Sweet. Well done, Eddie. All right so here's our first choice. I love that background by the way. Background's amazing. We can go right, but we won't. We'll use the jet adapter and fly up with it. And the jet as you can see changes the whole notion of rush jet really in the game. Um he can fly for a very finite amount of time. So you kind of just got to take a leap of faith here and then",

And we'll leave those other. We really don't need those. And then we just drop straight down back to where we're supposed to be. And then we'll switch back to normal Mega Man. Deal with that enemy. Again you're going to want to kind of just avoid these guys best you can. And then we'll fight with this guy. We're not quite in the strategic place we were with the other one. So we got to be a little more patient here. We can just get over here though and deal with him in a more direct way if we wanted to. Jump right into that. And here. All right.

And then we can jump right into this hole with the jet. I'll take this alternate alternate route up to an alternate layer where we can deal with this son of a **** named Tom. Oh why didn't it let me in there? So you could be a little more patient than that. I guess we'll take the normal route this time since I'll learn my lesson. Show you what that's like. Um but we'll still take that other route here. It's pretty direct. I mean there's just nothing going on. Those are the skulls you like, though, isn't it? You like those skull enemies from uh four which make a return here. That was an untimely death, but we'll get back to where we need to be. deal with him again.

And then we'll use By the way I didn't show you the jet uh animation so I'll show it to you once, which is pretty cool. So we go here, draw him out, kill before he even turns, which is nice. Get through here, go down. Got an extra life, which we don't really need, but we'll grab it. I'm talking **** I mean I just died so maybe I will need that extra life. Who knows? How many do I have? I only have three actually. So who knows what situation we'll find ourselves in. I'm going to avoid that energy this time as that was blunderous.

I use the So you should have enough. It It reminds me What's a good example? Like when you use gravity uh Gravity Man's attack gravity hold on Gyro Man and Mega Man 5 you have just enough to beat him and if you spam it too quickly he'll still be invincible from his last hit and therefore you won't be able to use it. So that's basically what happened to me there in case you're curious. It happens. So we got Beat B parts because we beat basically the real Tomahawk Man as opposed to the fake Tomahawk Man.

So Yamato Man is basically like designed after you know like ancient Japanese kind of samurai. And the stage is interesting because I have no idea how it deals at all with his um subject matter. But here we can sneak right through here. And I already show you. There's like an alternate path here. If we use the power attack we can just go right through. We'll leave that just in case we die and we need it later. Here we'll deal with this interesting mini boss. A lot of slow down here.

You can start through it, but it still is not quick or fluid, which is quite unfortunate when you're switching to the power adapters. So up there is where we would have come from otherwise. And then we all kind of congregate here in the same place. And here is another choice. This time we can use the rush jet. And this is another reason why I take the specific order through as well is just to make sure we have the appropriate not so much the rush stuff, but some of the appropriate weapons. For instance actually I still need the rush in here. Uh for instance um having uh flames to use on Blizzard Man stage is pretty pretty nice to be able to get that E tank. So that's the end of him.",

So you have to be able to use it uh in a way. You have to really kind of stay on top of your enemy or you're going to miss. Yeah man. It's funny cuz he shoots the spear, but then he has to go and run and get it, which I think is Kinda Funny. As you can see here there he is done. And now we're going to get the Yamato spear.

It reminds me a lot of the needle cannon in Mega Man 3 although when you shoot it it goes a little bit up or a little bit down. So next up, Nightman. Great design. Ball and chain attached to him and a shield, which is cool, which blocks actually attacks. So it's actually a practical thing. Cool stage as well. Reminds me a little bit of King Knight stage in uh Shovel Knight. So these those enemies basically have to be like prodded out um of their hiding place in order to kill them. This place this part's a little hairy. You got to kind of just be careful. Find a place to hide from these spikes. kind of just get through.

So here kind of bring him out and hit him and then he exposes himself and you kill him. Oh ran right into that one. Let's go. Oh Eddie's being quite generous today with the E things. Quite generous. God I feel like we already have like six. Seven. We have seven and I used one so we would had eight. So these enemies have glasses on and you shoot them once and then they freak the **** out. And there's another E take up there which we can get with the rush ship. So these bombs you'll remember from Mega Man 5 as well.

We want to use the one down here. And Kevin was asking before how you kill these guys. You you kill them with a loaded thing like that if you want to. So here you just destroy that to make the jump and then you switch over to your Yamato spear. Yumato spear is a weapon that uh Nightman cannot block. He you can expose him with anything.

Why is Oh my is my stick down? Oh I was like why am I running to the right? My analog stick was pressed down again. So that will give us uh Nightman's weapon and we can move on. We're almost through. We're going to fight Centaur Man next which is maybe one of the more unique um enemies. So Night Crushing. We got the the uh A parts as well for Beats. We're almost there. It's basically just a projectile. A big ball and chain projectile. Nothing too fancy. So now we'll move on to Centaur Man. Very mysterious creature. He's guarding the ancient city and he uses a weapon uh in the time stopping of the time stopping variety. So think Flashman think um Brightman etc. So there's an underwater portion here.

Remember that you're going to be extra buoyant and have a little bounce because you're underwater which is good. You can use it to your advantage. It can also be used to your disadvantage as these spikes blinding the ceiling will are attempting to prove to you. So just make your jump carefully. Kind of rem that was close. Kind of reminiscent of Bubble Man stage a little bit. If you're feeling unsure you could just use an attack like let an enemy hit you to make you invincible and then kind of makes things a little easier because you can touch the spikes for a brief second which you might find useful. See if we can get to that before it disappears. Nope. So here this is an interesting little puzzle. The water's like upside down. You can use it to jump high or low.

We can't keep getting E tanks. It's not fair. So he didn't give us one. It's rare to get one E tank nonetheless too. We've already gotten two on this player from Eddie. So these guys are basically submarines. You just want to kind of get out of here. Not mess with them. Let these guys congregate. and then just kind of avoid them as best you can and get out of there before they cause you trouble. Here you're going to want to draw some more enemies out if you can before you continue along. So here's another option.

You can stop time as you can see there and then use this thing to hit you. That's the end of him. So Centaur Man's done. We're going to get his centaur flash here which we'll use on the final enemy Windman. Look. And Windman's kind of derivative. I mean Nightman's super unique. Windman I mean there's it's very similar to Airman H. No. So this is a very similar weapon to ones I've kind of made fun of in the past where they don't really do anything.
