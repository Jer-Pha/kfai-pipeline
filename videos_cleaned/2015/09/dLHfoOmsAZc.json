Dwarven Darkness: I recently bought, I recently bought the original Kingdom Hearts, having rented it as a kid and enjoyed the limited playtime I had. As much as I love the idea and setting, the controls completely ruin it for me. Why is hack-and-slash combat menu-based? Why not map those actions to the triggers and have the right stick control the camera? All ranting aside, what games have you tried your hardest to love but they just won't let you? Well, that's a design, those are design decisions of the time. Yeah, and that's like gear conversation. Sounds like Nick Scarpino on the plane, 'Why do I do this? Why can't I do this?' Well, we didn't know how to do that yet, Nick. When this game came out in 1998, nobody knew the **** what you're talking",

When this game came out in 1998, nobody knew the **** what you're talking about. Tank controls were just, that's how you were, that's how you controlled games. Yeah, yeah. Um, I mean, I've talked about it a lot, and I actually did a panel with GameSpot at E3 at PSX just a couple weeks ago called 'Your Favorite Game Sucks,' which was about games that we, that are beloved, that we just hate. And so Assassin's Creed is the example from me. Like, I want, there's like no series in this world I want to love more than Assassin's Creed. I just **** hate it. Like, I just, I hate it, I hate it, I can't, I can't get over it. So that's, I won't belabor that because we talked about it so much, and you can watch that video.

Um, so, uh, that is my example, Assassin's Creed. Yeah, I've said it before, I think on this, like, I wish I cared about Final Fantasy. I wish I could get into Final Fantasy. I've tried so hard. It's just that like every time I get jump in and I try to play one, the setting doesn't click for me, the characters don't click for me, and then I just don't care, and I'm not going to invest 100 hours into it, right? Which one did you, have you played? I've tried with VII, I tried with X, I tried with XIII. Uh, there's probably a few I've missed. I'd be interested to see what you thought of IV or VI, just because those, especially VI, I think the setting would more click with you. Okay, it's like magic meets like technology.

And then, of course, MOBAs. No, I wish, I want to get, no, I, well, I've, I've tried playing Crisis. Hey, they put DC, they put my favorite **** universe into this genre. I don't know, it worked really well with MMOs in DC Universe Online. Maybe it'll work, turn on this MOBA. Oh, this is **** awful. How does anybody like, yeah, talk to Mitch. He's like, 'Oh, I played 15 hours of Dota and hated everyone, and then I got it.' I'm like, no, no **** way, no thank you. I'd rather play 15 hours of something I love than do that, you know what I mean?

So my answer is actually the reason that I chose this topic or this question is Kingdom Hearts, which is funny because I, I actually went through it though. Oh, you powered through it? I powered through it. Got so, when Kingdom Hearts, I was right there with this guy when it first came out. I loved the setting, loved the idea, Final Fantasy and Disney together. I was like, totally sold. But I did not like the game when I first played it. And like, I remember I played through Kingdom Hearts I, put like a bunch of hours into it, and I'm like, 'Man, I just, I want to like this game, and I really don't,' right? And then I, I kind of gave it some space, and I came back to it, like, still don't like it. Then I was like, 'Just keep, keep doing. I need to beat this game.' And by the time I beat it, I'm like, 'I do like this game.'",

And by the time I beat it, I'm like, 'I do like this game.' But then it was like, it, what he's saying is right, like the controls never totally felt right, and things were kind of weird. And then by the time II came out, I remember playing, I'm like, 'Oh no, I do like this.' II totally kind of upped it. It made it control a little bit better, felt more fluid, the camera felt right, the platforming wasn't like horrible like it was in the first one. And I was like, 'Oh, this is actually enjoyable.' But I'm really interested to see Kingdom Hearts III and how it modernizes that, the, the gameplay. And I think it, it will in a lot of ways. But Kingdom Hearts was that game for me that I was just like, '****, I want to love this. This is made for me, and it's not clicking.' But I powered through, and it did click.

I feel like a lot of, a lot of Nintendo games are actually that way for me. You know what ones I remember, and these came out at the same time, this PS2 versions, well, obviously for the one, but Hitman, whatever Hitman was on PS2 that I'm thinking of. I think it might just been Hitman. I was like, 'This sounds great,' and I played, I'm like, 'This isn't, this isn't what I wanted.' And then Shadow of the Colossus. Oh wow. Everyone was talking about how amazing Shadow of the Colossus was. It's like, '**** yeah!' And I sat down, I'm like, 'All right, oh no, I'll power, I'm going to power, I'm going to power.'

And I sat down, I was like, 'Nope, I just don't do this.' I will, I will throw in real quick before we move to the next, to the next question, that I, I mean, I understand why people like it. Yeah, it's totally one of those games I respect and understand, and it's just not my, it's not for me either. But I will say that a lot of people ask like why I like side-scrollers so much in just old games. And I'm like, 'Because this is, these games feel great still.'

That is the way games, Mario, the way Mario 1 controls is perfect, and Mario 1 is a perfect game, really. You know, it's a, it's a **** masterclass to make a game, and it will always be that way, and it will always age that way, and you cannot say the same about a lot of 3D games. You can't. It's just not going to happen. So that's a good example of why I really prefer, and not prefer, but I really love those kinds of games. It's just because that they'll always be good. That's why the NES is my favorite console of all time, because before things got too heinous and complicated, that's the way we controlled games with a D-pad and two buttons.

The games that were great in 2000 are not great. Great point. Yeah. All right, second one now. MetroShade, it is your time to shine, MetroShade. What are your thoughts on fan bases of certain games? I recently finished the Dragon Age series and was really captivated by the tone. I poked around online and found huge dedicated fan base communities to the games, but not just the games, characters, romances, etc., especially around Tumblr. Have you guys ever been a part of a fan base like that, and if so, which ones and to what extent? This actually brings me up a point I meant to make in Colin's, where he was like, 'I don't think it now, a Witcher,' but I think the Witcher community is huge too. And, and you know what you're",

Like the closest I got is DC Comics, you know what I mean? But even that, there's people who know way more about DC Comics than I do. And like a great example recently was Metal Gear. And like, I'm always talking about Metal Gear, I love Metal Gear, I'm so into Metal Gear, right? And I played it, and I'm playing my, I'm doing Let's Plays based on my first playthrough of this game, so I'm getting caught and all stuff.

Of like, at some point you have to figure out what that means and check it, 'cause there's always going to be a bigger fan than you, you know what I mean? Even Mega Man, right?

That's a great point. 'I'm a bigger fan than you.' Yeah, I, although I will say, I, I don't, I think passion is shown in different ways. I would stand that I, I don't know that there's necessarily anyone that loves Mega Man more than me, but I'm not saying that I love Mega Man more than anyone else.

I have a great respect for fandom in the sense that, uh, people get really dedicated into these things. They fanfiction or whatever, do fan art. I think that's, I'm not talented enough to fan art. Uh, I used to try to draw Mega Man, just didn't work out very well. Uh, but I've never gotten so deep into something that I was like writing serious fanfiction or like just, I was on a forum that was dedicated just to Mega Man, and I would just post about Mega Man.

Nemesis is going to be back for sure in, in a whole bunch of stuff, I bet, 'cause that was such a brilliant idea of making an open world game your own, you know what I mean? Of like, 'Oh, I have,' because for years, right, you'd have that in your head where you play games, especially like in like Streets of Rage or whatever, side-scroller beat 'em up, where I remember inventing things of why I'd see the same guy again, that he was back, right? And then Nemesis like spells it out for you. For me, I was telling you about this a couple days ago, but the, the rewind mechanic in Prince of Persia. I thought that was **** awesome, and it allowed such cool gameplay and just like the time, like messing with the time and stuff. Like, I feel like other games have used it, but I feel like that I would love another Prince of Persia that",
