We're gonna show you one of his prior match. Yeah. Of his Warzone mode. So we're playing right now with 4 people. Yeah 1 on 1. Two teams in 1. So it's us versus Team Sean Finnegan. He's out there somewhere. Team Sean Finnegan. So we're the Reds this time. He might even be on our team. Who knows? No. No Sean Finnegan's. No everyone else is Sean Finnegan. All the Blues are Sean Finnegan. Every single one of them. Can I request something yet? I don't want to. He's probably hiking. You can find him in the mountains. I'll go find him in the cliffs. Alright so this Warzone mode. Pretty much there's these things called Wreck Points. Yep. Right? There's Wreck Stations where you go to and you can kinda get different weapons and stuff.

Killing AI killing bosses killing other... Humans. Like real players. So that's the thing is there's 4 players but in addition to that there's a lot of AI controls. Just random units and like kind of bosses. Like bigger event based things. And then like this guy right here. One of these is just normal base. But like there'll be these big guys that are worth more points. So obviously everyone's kinda going after them. Try to beat them get the points get the better weapons and stuff. There's also a thing called Wreck Packs. But they're kinda like booster packs of cards. Yeah well in these cards they have either cosmetic this is random right? So it's cosmetic items.

I pulled a different type of assault rifle. It's still a Common Card but it'll cost like eight points in order to use that. Yeah so each pack so there's Bronze Packs Silver Packs and Gold Packs. Each one obviously based on the level has better cards or whatever. You get Common Cards Uncommon Cards and Rare Cards. It's kinda like when you bought Pokemon cards back in the day. Buy the booster pack you open it you have that moment. So when you die you get the different packs and then you just use them in your match.

Even in Warzone even if you have really powerful cards that you eventually wanna pull you still have to earn there. You still have to spend those Wreck Points in order to get those higher level tiered weapons vehicles et cetera. Shit is going down. Let me back up real quick one time. Your team's on him though. Yeah we are. Team Sean Finnegan it doesn't stand a chance. Don't watch out for the Blues though. Sturdy Blues. We're liking that. Oh oh. Nice. See that was a team effort. Team work. Team.

Headphones are made at you just kind of step out of the way. I have no audio I don't have my headphones on so I'm just kind of it's weird it's weird. It's a different experience giving me no headphones. Yeah. Do you ever game normally without a headphone like headset or anything like that? Well I need audio I can't play games without audio. It drives me nuts. Uh oh careful. I'm just gonna boost that real quick. Boost oh. Couldn't boost you weren't fast enough. Finnegan too fast too Finnegan. Too fast too Finnegan.

Yeah so we were saying earlier that these packs don't affect Arena play when it comes to gameplay changes. But there's cosmetic changes like your armor loops or different assassin kills and stuff. They're the same kills just different animations. Ooh. They have a Warthog. Finnegan. Why didn't you think he had a chance? I don't know I don't know what that was. He just got his shoulders tossed into the wall. He kinda just stood there. He responds so quickly there's so many of them. All right okay. Oh my God. Ooh. Let's just you know what I mean?
