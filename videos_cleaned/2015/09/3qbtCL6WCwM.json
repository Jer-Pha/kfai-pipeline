            "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome to Kinda Funny Games. My name is Colin Moriarty. Today I want to play a game called Mad Max for you. Mad Max is from Avalanche Studios, came out September 1st, and it's being pretty criminally overlooked, although maybe rightfully so because it came out the same day as a much more critically acclaimed game that people were more excited about, Metal Gear Solid 5. But uh, nonetheless, it's a game that I've been playing and I've been enjoying, and and people have asked me to show it to them. So in addition to our Gamescast episode, uh, or clip about uh, what Mad Max is all about and if you should play it, I thought I'd show you the game as well. And here I have no real agenda other than to just play it and uh, see what happens. So I'm driving my car around called the Magnum Opus, which I upgrade, and we'll go to the map here and I'll back out and I'll show you uh, this is the map of the game. So the these areas up here, the Dead Barrens, I haven't been to. Gastown is kind of",

So the these areas up here, the Dead Barrens, I haven't been to. Gastown is kind of where you're trying to get, this this whole area, this Undiscovered Dunes area. Um, but then if you if you zoom in, you can see like little territories like the Balefire Flatland and the Black Moss and the Colossus and all this. I've cleared all of these areas as you can see from the check boxes. So the camps and the Scarecrow snipers, convoys, minefields are all cleared and I control this area completely. I also cleared everything else like the um, um, all of the the loot and everything that you can find. So now I'm kind of working my way over here. Um, and so we'll drive over here and actually we can do a main quest. I haven't done many main missions at all really. Uh, so we'll go to see Gutgash over here. I'm going to put a marker there and we'll just drive for a couple minutes and get there and then",

I'm going to put a marker there and we'll just drive for a couple minutes and get there and then we'll we'll explore some of the systems after this main quest. We'll do maybe a side quest or two and and we'll just see what happens. So as you can see here, the game has a day night cycle. Um, and it's I think the game's actually gorgeous. Um, as I said on the Gamescast, I can only think of one other game that made a desert look this pretty and that was Journey. Um, and obviously this has a more realistic view look. Uh, so you can see the red dots on the hood. I'm being followed by a car and so we'll show some of the car combat. Let's see if we can get him to come and he'll probably smash up behind me. So where is he? There he is. Okay, so I can use my shotgun to shoot his wheel out if I want or I can switch over to uh, my Harpoon. Now his car is disabled. Um, so I'll actually just he's got a friend here so",

You so then I can just kind of run that guy over I want as well. He's done. And then this other guy's disabled too and so we'll take him and his car out at the same time. And this guy looks like he's pulled over seeing what's going on. So we'll just kind of destroy him as well and we'll shoot him with the Harpoon and we can drag him behind the car a little bit if we want and then we go launch him like that. So the car combat's pretty cool in the game and very diverse. Um, and since we're",

Um, and since we're talking so much about the car now, I guess I'll just go into the menu and show you guys actually go to the start menu and go to the garage and it's here there's significant upgrades you can make for your car and I think this is what's really cool. So you have like a ramming Grill, um, you have armor, an engine, uh, exhaust and all these. So like your tires give you traction and you can buy new tires. Um, you can repair, you have a friend with you that can repair things for you. Um, and all sorts of implements and obviously the the Harpoon I was talking about. So there's a lot of cool things, cool upgrades to make for the car that I think is one of the most dynamic things in the game that people will enjoy. Um, in case you can see here, I actually should pull over. I'm going to pull over my car smoking because I",

I'm going to pull over my car smoking because I took some damage. So if I press up on the D-pad, I think this guy's name is Chumbucket. He's like my friend, he's my mechanic. He'll just fix the car. Um, and it's funny if I start driving again, he'll actually get back into the car automatically. But if I just go slow enough, I can actually get him to to fix the car while I drive. So you can like go kind of fast and then kind of utilize your time wisely by getting him to fix it while you're moving. Um, although if you accelerate, he'll just jump back. But this is very useful when you're taking down convoys in the game, which is something maybe we'll show you because that's actually the hardest part of the game and that's when you're dealing with like eight vehicles at once. All right, so the car is all fixed up and we'll continue on our road here and again",

I think I've done like six of them or something like that. So I'm not very far into the game if you're just kind of cruising through very directly. Um, but still it might be worth noting in case you're wanting to go into the the story fresh that this will be spoilers. Although again, the story of the game to me is not so important. The story really is garnered in my opinion by um, the very act of exploring the world and history relics specifically and hopefully we'll show you those as well. So you can see the exclamation point at that base far off. This is where I'm trying to get. The reason I'm not driving there directly over the desert is because um, frankly, you just go really slow. It's just easier to stay on the roads for",

It's just easier to stay on the roads for the most part. And the roads aren't always clearly delineated. You can see like it kind of blurs in here with the with the desert, but you can kind of see where the previous tires have been. And in case you're curious, I'm playing on PlayStation 4, but you can also play on Xbox One and PC. And people seem to really enjoy the PC version. It's supposed to be very very pretty and very customizable. So if you are a PC Gamer, that might be the direction you want to go. All right, so we've arrived at one of our bases here. It's going to load up quickly and then we will uh, jump in and get our new mission. So now I'm on foot and I have projects ready to be built. So we'll see what that's all about in a minute.

So like I have the parts needed to build, let's see, uh, an Armory and an oil well, right? So we can find those and build those as well. And you find those parts by scavenging around. So as you can see, it might be a little confusing, but there's a lot to do in the game, just a lot to do. So let's run around just see if we can find where these things are even going to be built because I'm not too familiar with the layout of this area. So you see see for the Cleanup Crew build, I need one more part so I can't build that. So this is a dead end for me for now. Run back up this way. You can see the exclamation point is the guy I need to talk to. Oh, so there's what behind him is a blue part. So this means I can build this. So if you go up to this, I can build the oil well. So Max will get down and do his do his",

So Max will get down and do his do his work and then this oil well built means that um, the Magnum Opus will my car will automatically be refueled when I enter this stronghold. And fueling your car is one of the things you have to keep in mind as you're playing the game. And now they'll show a shot of the kind of the the outer building kind of getting a little stronger. So the strong Gutgash's stronghold has been improved. You don't have to do this, but you you know, it's fun to do. All right, so that's done. So now let's talk to him and see like what his mission is. So Killer Little Count Carburetor says he need to bust through the Jaw. I'm going to Gastown. Sure you are. Now me, I know a lot about G and I think the characters are really cool in the game. I trade goods in and out of all the you want something say ain't no sweet talking you is",

I trade goods in and out of all the you want something say ain't no sweet talking you is there is that the same in the movie? I seen that Harpoon. Um, no, I don't think so. I think the idea in this game is to build a new car because he loses his car of flourish. Let's say that's where you come. The Jaw looks imposing. Kevin was asking if that was the car from the movies and I was saying that the story through line seems to be, although I haven't done much of the story yet, that you're trying to create a new car in order to seek revenge on some people, something called the Talon. And you have it. I know who does. A is of a. Now when I think so fun about this world is that this is what I was talking about with Greg on on the Gamescast. If you had seen it, I'm sorry if it's repetitive for you, but but the world is full of crazy people. They're all crazy. Even Max is crazy. And it reminds me a lot of the way",

And it reminds me a lot of the way I've heard some people talk about Batman where they're like Batman's just as crazy as the villains he's fighting. It's just he's more metered and more maybe relatable. But every to live in that world, everyone has to be crazy. And in Mad Max, the world is over. It's done. And you have to really even wonder like why anyone is trying to live in this world at all. Uh, which reminds me a lot of Cormac McCarthy's The Road, which deals a lot with, you know, very keyy with suicide in that kind of in that kind of world where it's like everyone talks about how do you survive in a post-apocalypse and the world might be and the real question might be like why would you try?

The Harpoon is the thing that I shot that body with and the uh, and all that other stuff with when we were dealing with convoys. And you can see now it's daytime and look how look how astoundingly pretty this is happens. So we got to go to we have to go to Dim Dim Rim's Convoy. So I was telling you about taking down convoys and how it's difficult. It is difficult and it looks like we're going to have to do it here. So let me look at the map. I'm seeing the Green Dot, but we have to go here. He's right here. Um, I'll put a green mark on him, although he might be mobile. Look how pretty. Isn't it pretty, Kevin? Mhm. That might be one of the more underrated things about the game that people aren't talking about is just I think the game's gorgeous. The character models are great.

And during the day and there are these, I don't know if we'll see one, but there are random sandstorms that happen that just destroy everything around you and you have to go seek shelter and stuff. There's a lot of you're not find just a new car. You are, but your car can get damaged. And if you have like, you know, you can get so here we're at Convoy. I found the Convoy route. So somewhere on this Convoy. So you can see the red line here is this Convoy route and we have to find him. So he'll be driving in one direction or the other with a bunch of other cars. And so we'll just drive along the route and see if we can deal with them. You'll see smoke in the distance. Like I can't really see on this convoy too well, but you'll be able to see smoke of",

Well, this guy is not part of the Convoy, I don't think, but I'm going to **** him up. Oh, he's an aggressive one, huh? Pull off his wheel. He's driving along with me to try to keep me from pulling his wheel off, but he didn't succeed. So he's jumping out of the vehicle and coming at me. So we'll just destroy his vehicle so he can't get back in and and do anything with it and then be on our way. And actually, I should take this opportunity to heal my car. So there's the Convoy. So this is bad timing for me. So the Convoy is going still. And and the thing with the Convoy is you have to deal with the car.

So I'm going to I'm going to show you an interesting trick here that I realized when dealing with other convoys in the game, which is before I showed you that you can get Chumbucket to kind of fix your car as you're moving but not accelerating. And so you if the if the uh Convoy gets too far away, they'll actually reset and the damage you've already done to it will be reset. Um, so you want to stay as close as possible to it and then start pressing up on the D-pad to get Chumbucket to go fix the car as you're moving and do little bits of like try to stay with them and like let him heal the car a little bit. So stay still for just a moment and then that's long enough. And then you see I healed the car a little bit and I can kind of accelerate and get back into it again and",

And kind if you play it patiently like that, you won't lose track of the Convoy and then you can continue to kind of whittle down their their their health of his like friends. The the big problem really with the Convoy sometimes is not the Convoy itself, but that you run into other incidental cars that just join the fight and then it just becomes way more complicated. Um, so let's see if if I can if I can accelerate up to them and try to deal with another one of these cars and just kind of whittle them down, whittle their numbers down. It's going to take a little bit of patience. So here I can press the square button to kind of knock into them.

You can see them so they can kind of visually spot them. So what do you think, Kevin? You think this is interesting? This looks great. I love games where you have to like take over the territory. Me too. It's very it's very inspired, I would say, Kevin, by well, Just Cause. I mean, the studio makes Just Cause, but I feel like there's a lot of Far Cry in this game as well, which is a series I hold very near and dear to my heart. It's third person, right?

The Chumbucket character is really cool too because his arms are just like permanently black from the grease and whatnot. I think I actually think it's quite quite interesting. Um, so he let's deal with the next one of these guys we can. This guy has armor. You can see that number one thing above his car means he has one plate of armor. One of those guys peeled off.

This guy's like really coming at me. So his armor's off. He's going to try to get back with this car to protect him. And this is what I'm going to have to use Chumbucket again to kind of heal as I uh, heal my car here as I uh, hope that I don't lose the Convoy. And I'm going downhill.

The Convoy is taking significant damage and hopefully we don't run into any of his friends. This territory is still not totally controlled by me. So that makes it likely that you're going to run into someone else. Although this is a story mission and not a regular Convoy. So I don't know if that's actually shut off to make things a little more fair. All right, so take my shotgun back out, shoot again, and then one more shot should do it. So the Convoy is finished. And each member of the Convoy drops something useful, each leader, and they're called hood ornaments. And this guy's still following me. So not blow him up.

I'll show you in a minute. But most importantly, as the Green Dot indicates, I want to pick up the thing that the the Talon, which is a hood ornament. And we will install it. And so now you can see on the front of my car. And so the story mission is complete. So that's just an example of a story mission in the game. Um, and I won't get much I don't want to spoil too much more. Gutgash has some Wasteland Missions for me, it says. Now Wasteland Missions are side quests. And we can do those.

So you can actually go to hot air balloons that have been left behind, go in the air and then look around and find things. And I already did that. So we're not going to do that again. These purple things represent ramps that I can do like cool jumps off of. This this purple with circle with an exclamation point is someone of a person of interest that can teach me something.

So with that said, I'm going to put a mark on the map. Actually, I'll start over here. Um, and I'll show you what it's like the scavenger location. They're all very different. Um, and then we'll maybe we'll maybe take over one of the camps and I can show you some of the hand to hand combat, which I think is quite visceral and exciting in the game. It's very inspired by Batman. I think it little dumb down. Um, but I feel like you feel very powerful when you're fighting, especially as you utilize your shotgun in conjunction with everything.
