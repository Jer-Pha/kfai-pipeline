You can also play this version of the game on Xbox One. It'll be available on PS3 and Xbox 360, etcetera and so on, etcetera, etcetera. You're going to weigh your old, your old jerseys. I'm looking at them, taking, just taking a walk down memory lane, you know what I'm saying? I want to see if I can find, I wonder if they have the um, no they don't, the fisherman jerseys. Trust the gold, it's fisherman. Okay, ready to go? Yeah, so now, so Blackhawks versus Islanders in Brooklyn. This is my first time ever playing. Do you want to look at the uh, controls? Uh, no, you, you can explain them here. We, he, there, right? Do stick left, got it. Check, sure, sure, sure. Move player, so move, movement is on, movement is on the left stick for defense and listen, it'll be easy for me to explain it like this: movement on the left stick, always checking on the right stick when you're playing",

How do you feel about the real people in it? Uh, not the first time they've done this, I don't think. I, I actually think it's a little disconcerting. I wish I actually didn't show them. Um, I kind of like it. Well, because it's, I think a little jarring when you look at the character models, which I think are very nice. That, I mean, remember that NHL 15? A lot of people were really upset about it. Oh yeah, I forgot about that. It hadn't, it was missing a whole bunch of no features and stuff. And now, so they've added a bunch of features and taking a time and apparently taking a lot of feedback. And how do you like it so far? Uh, I",

I, I think the NHL games are great. Oh yeah. Um, and uh, they're fun. They've gotten quite complicated. You don't have to play them in that complicated kind of fashion. You can dial it back if you want to. Um, but here we go. This is a good match up. Islanders, uh, Blackhawks. So you're going to press back and then on the left stick and then back on the right stick when you the puck. That's how you, so R to pass. Oh, po. How do I switch? Switching is R. Ah, there it is. W me up now. How do I pass? R. Okay, that makes sense. So I, I, I play NHL almost year. I'm not very good at it. Um, I like to play it though.

I prefer to shoot on the, on the buttons, but I understand why you don't have, no, you have like no control basically when you do that. Oh my God, these saves, these acrobatic Corey Crawford saves. M for out there. Nice. Now, how do I uh, just is poke check my only check if I'm up on you? How do I like give you the old business? Use the right stick to, to check, to use a body, your body. Don't press anything. Oh, there's Sparky. Don't, what the hell is that got to do with the Islanders? So it's a funny story. You want to hear the story about this? I want to hear the story. Our Long Island's defunct Arena Football team was called The Long Island Dragons and that was the mascot and then we just took him. That's awesome. How long did you have an Arena Football League?

Did he not give, is he pulling a Belichick and not letting anybody have it? It could be. My thought would be that he's lucky to be coaching an AHL at all and he probably should take the money while again. Oh, little glove save by Corey Crawford covering the puck. All right, covering the puck. Playing very judicious game. You know how we do it. You know how I like to play my hockey. Like to play it like Ice Cold. M. C. So we can skip these.

How, or is it just based on how close you are that you're getting like the angles and the lit up thing? And what do you mean by that? Like I just shot and had it was just looked like I was shooting on a net. You come up and it lights up. It shows where the pucks like all. I don't know why that's happening to be honest. I think it's because I'm the second player and it's assuming I've never played before. That sucks. You probably shut it off, but I think it's probably instructive for, I would like it is what I'm saying. Uh, we can, want to try to go into the menus and figure it out now.

Is there a speed burst or is it all natural? It's all natural. Okay, Grabner just wasting some time here. Offside. I like how like you get little shots of them to look at all awkward. They're like, yeah, they're like, like jarring around. So how, what do you think about it so far? Are you enjoying yourself or you just kind not particularly yet?

See, that was the thing about Madden too, where they, they did put it in like you're going to automatically wrap up or or ramp up to power, but uh, you can also force it if you need to. I don't like that it's on the left stick. I don't like that at all. It's click in, it's fine, but I, but I still feel like I need a little bit like I'm still Dipsy doing around.

If you're, if you, if the, if you, if a body enters two skates, like you can straddle the line, which is when a player will skate along the blue line. That's legal if as one skates in the neutral zone, but the puck must enter first. That way that stops you from camping. Okay, you understand what I'm saying? No, you could have, you could keep. John Tavares could just stay in the offensive zone the entire time and just wait for someone to pass on the puck. Gotcha. So it's, you know, it's very similar to soccer. H. C. L. Safe.

I feel like hockey is still, we're going to go out there and get our teeth kicked in literally. We're going to maybe get our jugular slit with a skate. We're going to go and back in the game later. Yeah, exactly. I do, I do agree that, you know, and we have a lot of European viewers, although I don't know if anyone's, anyone actually watch this video. They are, uh, oh, you're covering the puck. Two seconds left. Greg, I mean, he just falls on it. Colin, there's not much I can. Greg, you're covering the puck. Okay, stop covering the puck. Okay, baby.

Yeah, even Brock Lesnar. Yeah. Uh, just because like there's, there's all these examples of them of hockey players literally getting cut by a skate across their face or their neck, getting 5 stitches in the locker room and they're there after the Zamboni comes on, you know, and they're back. And it's like that's a ballsy sort of 100% with you. You know, and that's to be expected. You got a tooth knocked out and you're still in the game.

When you watch these guys, this generation of hockey players that are playing now, watch the generation of hockey players that came before them and they were tough. And so they feel like they need to be tough. And I feel like in football, which I think is a very tough game, but also a game where, uh, football I love very much and it's, it's, you know, I love the NFL. Um, there's still excuses made in terms of, um, in terms of like injuries and and you know, kind of babying people a little bit, stuff like that. And that just doesn't really exist.

I mean, it's if you have a concussion or something, you should obviously, you should obviously play, play careful and stuff like that. But the point I'm trying to make is, you know, there's just a different level of expectations in terms of toughness, I think in the game. And it's funny, because I don't think the game itself is as tough as as football at all. See Sparky's head down there.

Well, the '90s were, the '90s were big for hockey. Yeah, the lockout, right? Didn't that everything up? The lockout in 2005 really was the one that, there was another one though, wasn't there? There was a strike like where the season was shortened. There was, we, the thing though that happened, which was almost unprecedented in professional sports, but we didn't, they didn't play at all in 2004-2005, which was awful. It was awful for the game.

So if I trying to remember back to my NHL 94 days, is there easy way by number to tell who's a defender and who's offensive dude? Like are these 80 dudes supposed to be back there? Yeah, well, small number, it's, there's no real rule, but small numbers, single numbers are typically defenseman and then high numbers are typically offense. But you know, like 1 is an offense man here, but like our defense, like who's on the ice right now? Can't even see the numbers. So there's no harder set rules, but like typically like 13, 30, like 130 through 40 and stuff are usually goalies, but not always. Okay. Uh, two through nine are typically defenseman, but not always.

So I, I like, you know, but Johnny Boychuk has a high number and he's a defenseman. So it's, it's, you know, they're, they're, it's not like football. Football is like totally in the NFL is totally predictive based on numbers. Damn Travis Hamonic not giving flying. Cal Clutterbuck driving in the net. That's a good name.

Um, but uh, when he went to NHL Tonight, apparently like, you know, they'd order food and he'd always order chicken parm. That's awesome. So they started calling him Chicken Parm Ray.

How long ago was that? 20 years ago. Oh Jesus, 20 years ago. I mean, this, this Islanders team now, tradition has a new home. Um, this Islanders team now is the first like competent, like super competent, really good team in 20 years. You know that the H, like there it's the first time anyone's had any expectations of them in a long time. And it's sad that they moved during that. Oh right, nice. Oh, I thought that went in there.

Yeah, in a game and they'll like write all the ways down. He's just got a great vocab. How did you just push two of my guys out of the way to do that? It's Islander hockey, bro. People like that play this game like routinely are like, what is this? Yeah, you, I'm, I'm more trying to just celebrate the game, bro. And by the game, I mean like hockey, because they're so close.
