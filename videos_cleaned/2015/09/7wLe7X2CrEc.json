My dog Portillo thinks it's a Bark Box 'cause everything he thinks is a Bark Box. Uh, if you didn't know, this of course is the $80 special edition, super special edition, uh, that you can get off of websites and stores. I believe it's sold out. Amazon doesn't have any more of them, I know, but I got mine, so I'm going to tear into it now. Don't get all weird, here's what I want to do, an unboxing. I tear open, everybody freaks out and does all stuff. I'm a huge Persona fan, but I of course want what's inside, and my box has already been up from shipping. You know, you can't trust this US Postal Service. You go turn it open like that, you do this. Uh, if you didn't know, which I know you, why would you possibly click on this video if you didn't know Persona 4: Dancing All Night's the new rhythm game set in the Persona 4 Universe. If I, if you want me to read the back of the box",

If I, if you want me to read the back of the box information here for you, it's, oh, it's coming off. Oh, it's shiny on both sides. Now it's just a shiny box, a shiny bent box. Uh, of course it says here, \"It is the definitive collector's edition of Persona 4: Dancing All Night. Pop Idols go missing when the Midnight Stage opens. Only Rise, you, and now why is Rise getting top billing over you, the character you always play as? Interesting. Uh, the rest of the P4 crew can solve the case. Music, rhythm, and motion combined to test your skills.\" So on and so forth. Let's see what we get in the box. I've beaten the game, no big deal, by the way, just let you know. Kevin, does that impress you? Yeah, good. All right, so here we go. First off, of course, we get the game. Get your little Vita copy of it there. \"Tune in, turn on, and get down,\" they say.

Persona 4: Dancing All Night. Not bad, not too shabby. Uh, I have the digital uh, edition of course, of Persona 4: Dancing All Night, so this will be given away on Colin & Greg Live, twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames. Come look for it then. The stuff inside of the collector's edition, I of course am keeping 'cause again, big, I'm wearing a Junes sweatshirt. \"Every day is great at yours, Junes.\" Um, jumping in here, and I love Nanako. Nanako's so cute, you know what I mean? I should have brought my little guy. I have, I've only bought one Persona 4 statue, it's Nanako. She sits there, she has an eggplant, she's so goddamn cute. So the first thing we got, oh, Portillo, none of this is going to be for you. It's a pouch. It's the pouch for your Vita. It's got of course, Teddy in the front. He got a little, got little dingle dangle jungle there. The logo for the game. Teddy in front, Teddy and",

Teddy in front, Teddy and back as well. And it's got that plastic smell. It's like, remember when you get, Kevin, remember when you go, you get something new for your, new for your pool, you know what I mean? Like a new inner tube. It smells like that. And then you open it up, zip it. It zips so easy. You open up, take out this thing. What do you got here? Take out the the silica packets that you want to eat, but they say, \"Don't eat.\" But I bet you could probably eat them. \"I can't eat them,\" says Kev. Okay, you put your Vita inside there, and there you go, D, you got a little Vita case now. Now, if I remember correctly, I think they say this thing interchanges, double, oh no, double-sided. So there's one side, there's two side. That makes sense. Now my Vita is in there, it's protected, and I have a cool stylish case when I walk around and I go, \"Hey,",

Nothing, just playing Persona 4: Dancing All Night.\" Put that down there. What's up next? Next up, two things. Oh, it's my DLC code. I'm not going to show 'cause I want it. Of course, 14 DLC costumes and bonus songs. \"Congratulations and thank you for your purchase of the Disco Fever Edition of Persona 4: Dancing All Night. Please see the reverse side of the flyer for details on how to get.\" You go there and you put your thing, and it's not that hard. We all know how to do this. Now here we have Persona 4: Dancing All Night Vita cover. You slide this on your, your little, your, your Vita there, and you go, \"Hey, you know what? I'm sick of this bland, boring Vita. I got just black Sony. What were you thinking?\" You take this guy, you pop it on, and there you go. You got it. You got a cool Persona 4",

Uh, you can also, oh, this protects your Vita, your Vita Slim, your Vita Slim, right? Your .0. Oh man, my serial number rubbed off this thing. But yeah, that's, I know how Vitas are calculated. .0. Now also, you get 10 special wallpapers are available for to download on this one. You got to go to this link. How to apply: Number one, wash your hands. I like that. Wipe the Vita with a clean cloth, and then you put it on. They, you do all this stuff, great. Push out the air bubbles. But then you can go to this uh, web address to get the wallpaper. Spoiler, I'm probably going to show you the web address, so just no.

It's a Teddy keychain. Now, Portillo, for real, like there's, it is not, it's not food, py. Like I hate it on the bags, have no opening. There you go. I got a gold Persona Teddy keychain there. Now you, I'm sure we'll get a close-up of it. You see little Teddy there being all cute. It's, it's a cartoon version of Teddy. Is this the Teddy you play as in the game? No, this is a dumbed down version of Teddy. But of course, who's going to complain? I got a dumbed down version of Teddy right there. And then I'm sure the kicker and the thing a lot of you are looking forward to, and of course, is the soundtrack itself. Let's read here. It's a two-disc CD soundtrack, more than 50 tracks with remixes of your favorite Persona themes. Uh, tracks by D.D. Mouse, TK Bonavox, D. Nor Shawa, Nebraska Yam, and",

Remember all these old, Kevin, you remember being old and how do you open a CD? Lord Almighty, what year is it? Look at me, everybody. There we go. It's open. That's how you do it. Use a key or something, or in this, Portillo, does it pass inspection? Py, does it smell like a CD? Yeah, okay. Open it up. There you go. Two discs, one pink, one blue, with all your favorites. Uh, I got 4 on disc one, 39 on disc two. That's a good deal. That's a lot of songs here. Have the every great, there it is, number nine, vocal version, Junes theme. I'm all set.
