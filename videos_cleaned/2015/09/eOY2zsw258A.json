We missed you last week. We were dead last. I **** put Nick Scarpino on the show. I know, I'm so sorry for that. Jesus. My one of my favorite things about having Nick on the show is just being able to introduce him, just being like, 'And Nick,' because every time he just does that thing where he just looks at me like it hurts him a little bit. Yeah, and I like that. Tell him a lot, 'Stop, you know, paying attention to his wife and start playing more games.' It's one of those.

Oh man, I like to imagine that's what's going on in Nick's brain all the time. It is. I mean, you know, it's definitely nothing, it's not video games. I definitely not video. Well, now it is. He's hooked on Metal Gear. He he yelled you and Kevin today to stop talking about Metal Gear because you're past him. Yeah, even though I don't think we are, but you know how it is when you're like, when he's like, 'Huh, wait, how did you get that guy out of there?' He's like, 'Stop!'

Yeah, we're going to talk about it though. It's going to come up, don't worry about that. The first topic is Mad Max, but you can't talk about Mad Max without talking about Metal Gear as far as I'm concerned. True, true. Without Metal Gear, there would be no Mad Max. Exactly. That's kind of how things work. Got Mad Max. Mad Max. Big Rebecca, are you done? It's close. Um, this episode's brought to you by Volume. Shout out to Mike Bithell. Yeah, the the it continues.

So I figured we'll just kind of, I'll present the game uh, to you guys just like we did with those and you can ask questions and air your comments and concerns about just a fantastic game. My that's my first question actually is since technically this is going up to, we're recording today, but it'll go up later, are you ready to declare it game of the decade? Because anybody who's been watching Colin and Greg live knows that it went from Mad Max is okay, Mad Max is good, Mad Max is fantastic. Today in real time, tomorrow will clearly be game of the year.

Uh, so Mad Max is an open world third person game uh, by Avalanche, the proper Avalanche studio. So I mean, there's two studios now at Avalanche. The the American team's doing Just Cause, so the team up in Scandinavia is doing um, did this game, did Mad Max. And uh, it's based on the Mad Max lore. Kind of you play as Max, but it's just like any Mad Max, really. You really don't really need to know what's going on uh, in the story to understand what the world, like the the the stakes of the world. Um, I'd always say, especially with Fury Road, but I think even with the trilogy, um, that Mad Max doesn't really have a plot. It's like, it's just about the world. Yeah, it's that's what's so cool about it is that it's very, I feel like it's the first one is very plot heavy, but the the it's more about the world, I think, and like what happens in that world and stuff like that.",

How quickly it decays, which I think is cool because a lot of um, a lot of post-apocalyptic stories are about like The Road, for instance, is about like, we don't know what happened and it's sometime afterwards, or um, like a couple decades afterwards, or The Last of Us is a couple decades afterwards, or Fallout's hundreds of years later. But with Mad Max, it's it it seems to happen. The disaster is nondescript, all encompassing, and teams happen pretty quick. Um, so the game is a lot of fun and I think that it's being somewhat criminally overlooked by a lot of people. And I understand Metal Gear Solid V, I'm sure is probably a better game, kind of big deal. Um, but uh, I think that Mad Max stands up pretty nicely in its own.

Um, if they released it a couple weeks earlier, I think more people would have played it. It would have sold many more copies probably. But the game uh, combines uh, some Batman like uh, combat. I think dumbed down uh, a little bit from Batman, but I think I personally don't feel like Batman. I I know people like Batman, that's great. I I enjoy playing those games too. I I don't find the combat deep at all in those games. A lot of people, so this is dumbed down based on what you already said, it's not deep. Yeah, okay, exactly. Um, you're basically just mashing the button and I know people are like, 'Well, you can do this, this, and this in Batman.' I'm like, 'Well, the game doesn't force you to do it. You don't have to do anything, you know.' Yeah, if the game wants to be clever, it should force",

Yeah, if the game wants to be clever, it should force you to be clever. Um, this game doesn't make any pretenses about being clever. You're basically just hitting the square button to attack and then hitting the triangle button when someone tries to attack you to counter them. Circle to kind of roll out of the way and stuff like that. So it's very basic, but I feel I find the combat to be quite visceral and quite satisfying. Mad Max has this thing called a a a fury meter where you like the more combo you get, like you get more and more angry, basically more powerful in your attacks. You start healing yourself as you attack. He does things like body slam people and do all it's actually quite for as simple as it is in practice, it's actually quite simple. You also have a shotgun, but you have very limited ammo, so you don't have to use it and I don't use it really at all.",

Uh, none of them that I fought yet had have guns, uh, except for snipers. They have guns, sure. But everyone's ammo is somewhat scarce. There might be enemies in the future with with shotguns or something like that. Um, but people have like baseball bats and just use fists and brass knuckles and stuff. Um, now the one thing I think is really great about Mad Max is its style. And and I was telling Greg that uh, I think that no game makes a desert look prettier. This isn't technically a desert, it's used to be ocean, I guess. But um, than like except for Journey than Mad Max.

It reminds me a lot of what I've read and heard about theories about Batman, about how everyone's insane in that world, even Batman. And it's just a level of how insane or not insane you are. Sure. Um, and that's kind of the case in this world. Like Max is just as crazy in many ways as everyone else in the world. Interesting. Um, it's just that everyone else in the world has lost their minds.

So it's cool to explore that. I understand why some people are not paying attention to it, but I think that the the game's fun. It's very, there's a lot to do. It's very inspired, I think, by Ubisoft games in terms of big worlds in which you, especially Far Cry, I think, in which you kind of go from territory to territory and and kind of unlock things in those territories and take over forts and destroy things and kind of slowly bring it back under your control. So you're talking about, you understand why people are overlooking it. Talk about, do you understand why reviewers didn't like it? Why why it got scores? Yeah, I think, I mean, frankly, no.

But the general way I've heard people talk about the game is like, I'm a little confused about why people feel a certain way about it. For instance, I've read a lot about how it's like very samey and some of the character models are the same or some of the places you go are the same. And I'm like, first of all, I've not really found that, especially with the locations. I think the locations are quite diverse. But even if that's the case, like we love Fallout 3 with its four character models and its uh, like three interiors. Um, and a world, frankly, the Capital Wasteland, frankly, much less compelling world than this. So um, and the same thing with New Vegas. And I love those games very much.

I'm I'm not saying these games as good as Fallout. I'm saying that those those worlds have hold nothing nothing compared to to like the Mad Max world in terms of how dire it is. Um, so yeah, like I think people, I think, do you think, I'm sorry, go ahead. I was just going to say, I think it might be a product of people, and this is what I've been predicting for a long time, is people are getting tired of open world. And I'm kind of getting tired of them too. But I think that I I like what this particular world holds for me. Do you think that the reason people are being hard on this one, and you're comparing it to Fallout, you're comparing it to Just Cause, these different things, is there anything Mad Max excels at? You're talking about the combat is repetitive, you know, I mean, it's it's a d- it's even dumbed down versus Batman, which you don't like.",

Is there a story that's bringing it all together that makes it awesome? Well, so I think that the first of all, I think the environments are repetitive because the world's **** dead. So like, like what like what are you supposed to look at? Like I this is the one thing I said about Mad Max that I think resonated with me as a Mad Max fan, a fan of the lore, but also just a fan of the game, is that this might just have been as good as they could have done because the world of Mad Max isn't there's nothing funny about it, you know what I mean? Like it's not like and there's no normal people in it. It's not like Fallout where people are like trying to make like like lead kind of normal lives and stuff like that.

They're eating each other, you know, they're like, it's just a decaying, totally collapsing world full of sandstorms and awful weather and things turn on a dime. Now you were talking about the story. There is a story and I don't think the story is very important. I don't think the story is very compelling. The one thing I like about the story more than anything else are the little things you call you find called history relics, which are pictures and stuff in like notes that you find where it shows the world before decay or while it was decaying and how the world remained normal even when it was decaying until like a turning point happened in which everything kind of fell apart.

He like he he like talks to himself about like the pestilence that happened and the crops failing and the water disappearing and how we took everything for granted and stuff like that. And I think there's like a more much like a George Miller, anything George Miller touches, I guess, in this in respect of this franchise, there's a deeper kind of meaning if you want to find it. But there's that's not maybe the reason you'd play the game. See, what sounds interesting to me is that why did this need to be a video game? Cause you're saying this is as good as it you think can get for a Mad Max thing and it just sounds like, okay, the plot's not that good and the combat's not that deep.

It's not like for conclusion that it's going to be bad. Um, but with Batman, you know, people like Batman. A Batman game makes sense, you know, being able to play as Batman makes sense. Being able to play Mad Max isn't necessarily something like seeing the like the the movies. It's not like I need to play this, you know. Yeah, I don't I don't I mean, this is the first time they really tried to do something like this. And I I don't necessarily disagree that however cursorily it it's related to you know, Fury Road, it seems clear like those those were trying to be aligned with each other. Sure.

And I don't necessarily think this game's for everyone. I I would like, I feel like a game I really enjoy like Dying Light, um, can relate to a lot of people. I feel like even a game like Arkham Knight, which I think is overrated, is still a fun game. And I understand why people like it. And I think it's got great presentation value. I think the reason that I think it's not going to get much better than Mad Max in this is the same reason why I think you probably couldn't make a much a very like a a 9.5 or a 10 game on The Road. Like The Road is is my favorite post-apocalyptic anything that's ever been made. But it's like really dire and dark. And at some point, like there's no hope in that world.

You I mean, cause the immediate way to pin prick that theory would be The Last of Us. But there's hope in The Last of Us. So I'm with you. Yeah, exactly. The Last of Us is all about hope. Yeah, in in in in a way, it doesn't start out that way, but it it it starts out with a lot of loss. But I mean, The Last of Us becomes all about hope. Sure. Um, and Hope Solo. Hope Solo, exactly. Um, so like I I'm a little conflicted on on Mad Max in terms of like, I kind of get why people might not it might not resonate with people.

I think if you like games where you check boxes, which is basically what this is, then I think you're really going to like it because there's a lot of boxes to check. There's super deep customization options in terms of upgrading your character. Um, well, let let me let me back up. Like there's there's the systems are actually surprisingly deep and I like them, although I don't know that everyone would like them. So there's like these there's like hundreds of challenges that you complete. The challenges going be like, kill 10 guys with this thing, eat dog food five times, find 30,000 units of water, whatever it is. And then you for",

Then you use the experience points to uh, upgrade your character and you unlock like higher and higher levels. And like, so you're ranked. There's like 10 rankings or whatever. Um, and with within each ranking, it's like 10 sub rankings where you can like, you know, put your points into like getting more health or doing more damage or finding more loot when you, you know, those kinds of things. So there's like that upgrade system. Then there's like a whole thing about uh, the Magnum Opus, which is your car and how you can upgrade that.

Then there's like dozens of cars to find. Like you can jack other gangs' cars and like add them to your collection, use them in races and all those kinds of things to earn more experience points. Um, and then there's so like there's there's just a series of things to unlock. There's like fortresses that you unlock and then you build them up and stuff like that.
