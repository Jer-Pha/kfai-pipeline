This is the description, of course, and today we're going back to Mother Base, of course, Mother Base HQ. We have a million things to do. I'm coming here to wash up, re-gear a bit, then we're going back in the helicopter and we're going on a Mission Five. Yeah, there, oh God, this dog kills me every.

We'll get Take. Main target. There's the one mission I remember. I don't, oh, it's, it's one mission setting, I should say. Okay, and we might be coming up on it, I guess, where you come in. It reminds me a lot of like coming into like a Coliseum, because you know what I'm talking about? It's like a circular arena, and then there's like this back like stone structure.

Yeah, until I had a good path down, I was getting a lot of hiding spots. There's a lot of soldiers that you're not aware of or can't spot them by scope. All right, so we're going into Over the Fence. Yes, extract the engineer who tried to defeat a Soviet base camp and is now being held. Oh, at Watkinson BS. I see it. Ran into the thing over there. I was like, that's weird.

I'm going to kick the **** out of this guy. Or you can go around all the way up top the mountainside, and that's less um, defended. Okay, but you miss out on some other. So, up to you. All right, we'll see. I'm going to see how, how I feel when I get there, you know what I mean? Yeah, okay. You take that back route, you can end it quickly. You go out the other way, you can get a lot of good soldiers there. Barracks too. I, oh, this is the, yeah, it's got like the trailers where I can go in and get all the equipment.

So I ran around forever trying to open it. And I was like, do I have to come back? And when I have the ability to pull it out and all this stuff. And I like, I hate this game. I'll never play it again. Leave the rest to us. That's where we assume everybody plays. Run into any trouble and they're like, game over. This is too. I don't want to think. I'm not immediately good at this game. Garbage. Zero out of 10. I'm going to write a really mean tweet. People reading this don't have feelings. Doesn't matter to me here. Why is there really like this series? I was told it was going to be great. Yeah, yeah, I dropped in and didn't immediately love it. So here's where it gets tricky. So yeah, they can catch off guard if they, if you didn't take him all out. I know there's one guy who keeps walking back and forth in the prison area, but another guy will walk up",

You've been pretty thorough in your cleansing of this area, boss. You've entered a building. Always keep an escape route in mind when. Good story. Thanks. I'm in a building. I didn't know. I didn't just walk myself down here. Diamond. I remember the cries for help. My two favorite things. How Greg Miller spends his weekends. This is, and like for everybody watching who hasn't had the chance to play yet, there's nothing more satisfying than this. Getting all these materials just like, oh yes, I'm doing it. Oh, this minor metal. Can't wait. Exactly. One day I'm going to make it. It's going to be adult metal. Now I'm just knocking over things all willing to this. I can't be seen.

A first time you, I know, picked a lock. We were very familiar with it from Ground Zeroes, but here it is in Phantom Pain. Won't be your last. A plenty of opportunities to do that. Yo, bro, you want to get out of here? Fulton him right up into the ceiling. Slams his head. Yeah, usually if you do that, they'll get stunned. There's no reason. Stun drum. Great. If there's nothing in the way overhead, you should be able to Fulton him. See on the other side, Chief. And if you remember when you do your playthrough, there are plenty missions going down the road where you won't get the opportunity to Fulton in just anybody. Like someone you have to rescue. Maybe they have to be let out. They're too sick or weak to get through. That's a real buzzkill. I'm going to get right out of this. Let's make sure I got everything cleared. A lot of things checked on my boxes. Let's get out of here. What say?",

Support request. Yeah, we haven't seen any of the dynamic weather effects take place. I think we'll allow it for me. Rain really didn't pop up till Africa. I don't know if that's not how it is, but the desert, I mean, oh, the sandstorms and stuff. Right there is. I remember there was a mission where it's used as a, it gets introduced, doesn't it? It's like a plot device of like, everything's out. Yeah, everything's out. So you got to do this. Like, all right, shut up. I'll do it. I definitely like some demonstrations that TTW ran into it a couple times. Was on the way. But I also use the Phantom Cigar. So maybe enough time out. Run into it. Extract 13 soldiers.
