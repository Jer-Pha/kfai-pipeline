All right, so in the spirit of Danny being on the show, I'm a big fan of his one-minute matchup videos that are, you know, as he described earlier, two different characters fighting out with each other. It's a quick little, quick little Battle of the Death, and uh, it's a fun little video, and then there there's a winner and people get to you tease out what's happening next or whatever. There's a bunch of other series like this on the internet. There's ScrewAttack has Death Battle, Bat in the Sun does their Super Power Beat Down. Yes, and back at IGN on Start Gak Rip, um, The Ultimate Fan Fights. G attack, yeah, he would do those and those are always a lot of fun, but it's essentially just taking two characters, matching them up against each other and making them fight. There's something about that that's very appealing, such a really like just awesome cool thing. I mean, I remember even back in like the um, Newgrounds days, yeah, of just like animation stuff like Scorpion versus Ryu from",

And there's something thrilling about it where you want to see two characters fight. So my question to you guys, what would be some **** awesome matchups? Kate Bosworth and a motorcycle. Jesus, what? Just saying, put him out there, see who wins, see what happens. Yeah, I'm going to be honest with you, I got like, uh, I got my money on the motorcycle on this one. You're thinking of it already being emot? No, I just think of it sitting there. I don't think Kate Bosworth know what to do. I think Bosworth, she was okay, or she was also in that one Blue Crush. Oh, Blue Crush, you're right. Yeah, she's so so looking. The reason I say that is because I feel like she weighs five pounds, so she gets anywhere near the motor motorcycle, it's just going to like fall on",

Also, thank you to everybody who supports us on Patreon. Here, names I want to see them fight. All of them, all of them. It's like The Matrix battle. They're they want though because Dr. Kicking Amy Gills F, all all these people are so cool, they wouldn't fight each other. What they would do is they'd get together, they go out front night there and they go see a movie. They would, yeah, but like that's the thing with these things is these the fights don't necessarily need to be people that fight.

I can't really say anything about that one, but there is a Superman one that is being planned and I don't want to reveal what it is just yet. I'll tell you, I'll tell you off the and it's going to be a movie coming out next. Yeah, I'm I fun fact, I'm actually making that movie. Yeah, uh, Zack Snyder is actually consulting with me about who would win in that fight. So for you, when you're thinking about this, is it the biggest name or is it the funnest matchup or where do you start?

So a lot of people are asking who would win in a fight like Flash versus Quicksilver is by far the most requested video that we had. Uh, so I guess when people found out we were actually doing it, they freaked out. Like Nick was uh, Nick was telling me earlier, I'm insane for wanting to do that because of all the visual effects. Because the last time I talked to you, you were like, I'm like, how's it going, man? I'm good, man. I'm just like, I'm on hour like 18 of putting in arrows like into the for the. You're like, cuz I guess you just have the bow pull back, but you actually comp in the arrows that are going everywhere.

What we did with the Deadpool video, I thought was really fun. It's very different than what a lot of the other channels who are doing the same thing are, uh, where it's not really a character fighting another character, it's a character kind of fighting another version of himself. For the people who are just joining this topic, that was Deadpool the comic character versus Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Yeah, Origins: Wolverine. X-Men Wolverine Origins, thank you.

I mean, Spider-Man's got to be a requested one, right? Are you thinking of doing like Tobey Maguire versus Andrew Garfield? That was an idea that was legitimately a thought about the new guy, the new guy in there. We really wanted to do something with uh, Miles Morales and throw him in there. I think he's an awesome character and I was kind of stoked when they were rumoring that he would be be awesome. I thought that was going to be so cool. I really wanted to see Donald Glover like I've been him so **** awesome. A little old for the the character, but whatever, it's it'd be worth it. Cool about that though, Garfield versus Maguire.

But I like the idea of Miles Morales because his Spider-Man is different from Spider-Man. He has different powers and yeah, so that's ****. I would like that. You should do that. And uh, well, let's just say there's uh, there's some other characters where there's quite a few versions of that, you know, pretty Batman, Solid Snake, Big Boss. Think Kiefer Sutherland versus David Hayter. Well, so this is funny, uh, with Ultimate Fan Fights, I was like an associate producer on that.

They very rarely went with what I said said. Um, they did Cap versus Batman once. That's one they started with and that was cool. But I mean, that's like a weird match up. It's different than what you do. You it's from the classic '90s face off of DC versus Marvel, of course, where we had to fight for the universe. People univ. We had access from two red robots who won at the end. They shake hands and say, you've done well. They didn't give a **** at all. They just like did whatever they wanted.

No, but then there was other ones like Chun-Li versus Tifa and that was like, all right, we have two like kicking characters that makes sense, you know? Um, and then what else? What other ones? We did one that was really cool was Iio versus Solid Snake and they're both sneaking around and doing stuff and they got David Hayter to be the voice of Snake. Oh, **** really? Yeah, what?

Yeah, the only the only uh, thing that they did, which I thought was very interesting, was I think they composited all the backgrounds in which that episode was a little strange. They did it all in on green screen. So a whole background cuz that was they had a different direction for it. But because that was what sold us on the series, so it was kind of their pilot, right? And um, it it looked more like a video game than the rest of them, like a Smash Bros. stage basically. It was very Smash Bros.

Now it's hard to do obviously if you're going to do it from a fanm because you need the the RoboCop costume, but the Terminator would be easy, an easy one in a lot of views for you coming up here.
