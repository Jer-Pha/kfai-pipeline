            "text": "Welcome back to our Mega Man Let's Plays. Today I'm going to play Mega Man 3. This is not only my favorite Mega Man game, this is my favorite game of all time. I love this game. It's my favorite game of all time. I don't think it'll ever be beaten, uh, at least on the game of all time list. I'm going to beat it right now for you. Uh, Mega Man 3 is excellent, excellent game. Uh, I was absolutely obsessed with this game when I was a kid. This is Mega Man 2 is really the game that got me into Mega Man. Mega Man 3 was the game that made me obsessed with it. Um, as you'll see here, it adds a key mechanic, the slide. Uh, the slide stays a Mega Man, uh, throughout the rest of the NES series and then 7 and 8 and then disappears actually 9 and 10, which is based more on Mega Man 1. Um, so here we're going to start with, uh, Magnet Man, who is my favorite Robot Master of all time and a good place to start in the game. I used to dress up as him as a kid actually, believe it or not. I got to find a picture.",

I used to dress up as him as a kid actually, believe it or not. I got to find a picture. There's got to be pictures. I had this Fisher-Price magnet that came with this like my first science set and it was just gigantic magnet. I used to rubber band it on my head and, uh, run around like an idiot. I would still do it if I knew where that magnet was. So Mega Man 3, like 2, doesn't have a really firm order. You can jump in in multiple places. You can jump in with Magnet Man. You can jump in conceivably with like Hard Man or Top Man. You can jump in with Snake Man, which is a pretty popular way to play. I start with Magnet Man. We'll move on to Hard Man after that. The funny thing is is that eventually you're going to have to fight that was dumb. Basically, you're going to have to, uh, fight two of the Robot Masters at least with your arm cannon, which is unusual with most Mega Man games. You",

You jump in and then you can cycle them, but there's no cycle in this game. Disappearing blocks, of course, the bane of everyone's existence. That's that one up. All right, so we're going, I'm sorry, I go quiet sometimes. It's just, you know, me concentrating, even though I've beat Mega Man 3 literally, I beat Mega Man 3 probably 100 times. Um, so I know the game pretty well, but you know, there are people better out than me obviously out there. So we're all ready to Magnet Man. Just got to deal with his last Guardian here. The music's rocking too in Magnet Man stage. All right, so here we go. Magnet Man fights in some of a cycle, predictable cycle. He'll shoot Magnet Missiles, jump across the the screen like this. You can slide out of the way of them. Uh, every once in a while he'll try to suck you in like this.",

Uh, every once in a while he'll try to suck you in like this. And if you don't press anything, he'll actually bring it towards him because you are metal and he has a magnet. Why it doesn't work on him, I don't know. Kind of the answer to that question. He's probably made out of a special alloy. So you just got to be patient. If you, uh, later on, if you have like Spark Shock, which is Spark Man's weapon, you can actually use it on them and it does a lot of damage. We'll do that later in Wily Castle, but for now we have to just deal with the arm cannon. And that's the end of Magnet Man. And so we can move on here. Uh, it's worth noting that in the intro, which we we saw just a little bit of like the the state, the select screen before you get to the Robot Masters, there's a great song there. You should go look it up and and check it out. Mega Man 3 was rushed to market, um, by many",

Mega Man 3 was rushed to market, um, by many accounts and, uh, it's actually Inafune's least favorite Mega Man game. Um, and you can tell that there were supposed to be a cut scene there and they never did it because the song is like two minutes long for no reason. Um, and of course Mega Man 2's intro is like iconic. So I'm sure they wanted to do something cool and they probably just ran out of time. So there's a little bit of info for you. Nonetheless, even though Inafune likes Mega Man 3 the least, it's actually becoming more popular to think this is the, uh, the best Mega Man game. I think it's certainly the most solid. So here these bees drop little pal, little pieces of I don't know, Hive or whatever that drop five more bees. And you can actually just because the RAM and the NES is so limited, you can actually just scroll them off the screen. So things that",

So things that are the bane of your existence, like why enemies come back, you can also use it to your advantage to get rid of them. This enemy here is a play on Sniper Joe. It's called Hammer Joe. He'll throw hammers instead of, uh, annoying you with other stuff. And so we'll actually get rid of Rush here. You start with the Rush Coil here, by the way. This game also introduces Rush, um, for the first time in Mega Man 3. Obviously Mega Man 1, you had the Magnet Beam and Mega Man 2, you had items one, two, and three. And now they actually gave him a personality basically. So Rush is the dog and you'll be in this particular game, Rush Jet, Rush Coil, which you start with, and then Rush Marine, which is used very sparingly. That's an underwater Rush module. Those monkeys you might recognize from Wood Man stage of Mega Man 2. We don't",

Those monkeys you might recognize from Wood Man stage of Mega Man 2. We don't really have to fight this guy, but I do want to just get energy. So since I didn't get hit before, and this guy you can kind of like play some games with if you want, like try to get them to go that way and then just outrun them. So these are kind of plays on some enemies you meet in Mega Man 1, the guys in Guts Man stage that throw their axes at you. Now they're piloting these these devices. Grab an E-Tank here. And here you're going to deal with these that spread out of the ground and also the bees, which you can scroll off just make things a little easier for you. Here we'll fight Proto Man again, like we did Magnet Man stage. He's known, I'm actually spoiling it for you, he's known as Break Man at this point in the game because you don't know that he's spoiler alert, 5-year-old spoiler alert, he's Mega Man's",

You'll find that he turns on Mega Man, or does he? All right, so we're at Hard Man stage. We'll go to the Magnet Missile. Now if you're speedrunning Mega Man 3, there's actually tricks you use on Hard Man and you get actually get hit by him intentionally to make the fight go quicker. But I'm not going to play like that cause I try to play a little more elegantly. So there you would actually get hit intentionally because it'll allow you to move and then otherwise you just stand in the air and then you just kill him like that. Hard Man's dead. So from that we get the Hard Knuckle, which is a somewhat useful weapon, uh, especially in Wily's Castle when you need to break some barriers. It'll be useful on Top Man, who we're going to go to next, um, although you",

And that used to be when I was a kid, I used to actually start with Top Man and then go Top, Shadow, Spark, et cetera. All right, so we'll go to Top Man next. Bizarre robot. I have no idea what, I don't know what he was like, what he was doing. His stage is a greenhouse, which I think is kind of cool, but they probably could have done more with this particular character. Definitely one of my least favorite robots in any of games. Rockin' music on the stage though. Rockin' just soundtrack is so underrated in Mega Man 3. It's so much better than Mega Man 2's and people are like just on Mega Man 2's dick. And I'm sorry if the, I'm playing on PlayStation 4, by the way. I'm playing on Legacy Collection, if you haven't figured that out yet. I'm playing on",

I'm playing on Legacy Collection, if you haven't figured that out yet. I'm playing on PlayStation 4. I know the buttons are a little loud. There's nothing I can really do about it. Unfortunately, some a lot of slowdown here. If you play your cards right, depending on if that's what you want, you see there you can get the extra life. We don't really need it. Jeez, F here man, I f***ed that whole screen up as I was talking about how I don't need the extra life. This cat will create incredible slowdown. Use it to your advantage. Another one of these cats. This time the yarn goes off the screen because there's no barrier there. So the slowdown is not as severe here. You just got to be careful with your jumps up. Now this is cool. I can't always nail this, but this part you can actually play this part really elegantly because it seems like you can't get through this part without getting hit. You",

I almost want to go back and show you guys, but I just want to keep cruising. So you can time your jumps there to dodge it. But every time I've tried on the Legacy Collection, I think it's just the PS4 controller and the way I play on this as opposed to like the NES controller, the Wii controller is I just don't have the, uh, the nimbleness of finger here. All right, so Top Man is, uh, totally predictable. He has a pattern. He doesn't break it. And then you can just hammer in here and that's it. He just goes back and forth, shoots his tops in the air. You can slide onto them. He'll come across, jump over him, hit him. And you can just nail him with the arm cannon if you want to be a g or there cause his weapon. So Top Man's weapon is the first really unusual weapon in the game. Um,",

So Top Man's weapon is the first really unusual weapon in the game, um, because it's not a projectile. It's actually your body. Um, the Top Spin, it's called. And, uh, you press, you jump and press, uh, the B button with it equipped and you spin, um, and use your body as the as the, uh, the weapon basically. So we'll use that on Shadow Man. Shadow Man otherwise is the hardest, one of the hardest Robot Masters in any Mega Man game to fight. But with the with the Top Spin, he's much more manageable. But you have to sacrifice your own body in order to hit him. So here will be Proto Man again. So those devices up on the ceiling will, uh, make it dark. You can destroy them if you want. If you have the right weapons, you can actually use like Magnet Missiles on them, I think. Um, but there's really no need not here anyway. And those little grenade guys will come at you and explode.

And here you want to just get down here quickly so you can deal with that guy before he's all over you. Those guys are a pain in the ass. All right, so here you're going to want to play it kind of patient. You need to draw these like parachute guys out. You can do that by jumping at them and then back. It's similar to how you deal with the crabs at the end of Bubble Man stage on Mega Man 2. Definitely the same, um, design philosophy between this again. Right here you want to fire immediately and try to get under that guy if you can. Don't forget you can slide. These dragonflies will come in behind you and flank you. You can get through the wall. So then I'll show you guys Top Spin for the first time. We're only going to see it one other time in the game. Um, you can",

We're only going to see it one other time in the game. Um, you can use another enemies additionally. No need. So Shadow Man's a b****ard. Um, so you want to get up close to him and and press and you see you're just damaging him by pressing the B and spinning into him. And then he's dead. Fighting Shadow Man mano a mano with the arm cannon is very difficult. Um, you'll need an E-Tank for it, maybe two. All right, so we have the Shadow Blade, which lets us go, uh, next to Spark Man stage, um, and fight Spark Man, who's really one of the more unique Robot Masters, I think, in the game. He doesn't even have like real arms or hands. He has like these these conductors, which I think his design is fantastic. We also have Rush Marine, which is useless. We'll use maybe in Gemini Man's stage if we're feeling like it. Let's go to Spark Man. It's a fantastic design. I love that design so much. Very",

I kind of brute force my way through these things at times and just deal with the damage that you make. But here I'm like, what's the point? We'll need it for later. You would expect these big enemies to take more than one hit, but they don't get rid of them or they'll attack another Hammer Joe. And you can see his his eye appears and that's when he's vulnerable. So it's not actually when he throws it, it's actually right before. So these platforms you got to be kind of careful on. And these this this part here is is where I usually brute force my way through if I have to, but I won't have to. Actually, I will here. And then just kind of let run its course. Probably get hit again. Man, I'm",

So we'll get use the Rush Coil to get up here, um, and get the energy since we'll need that for later when we actually do with Spark Man and keep cruising. All right, I love this drop here. It's super dramatic. Reminds me of the end of Mega Man 2. Here there's a lot of like incredible amounts of slowdown. Speedrunners kind of use like try to deal with these blocks to make it not slow down so much, uh, because there's just so much. You could tell that the game was rushed too because there's just a lot of moments like that. They didn't weren't able to optimize. You can get like a really long slide going here. Here you're going to want to",

Here you're going to want to draw enemies out, um, and you can actually use, um, the Magnet Missile on those guys. So here I'll show you to get rid of these guys. And you kind of want to just draw them out cause they're going to knock you out. They're all strategically placed, of course, in the most obnoxious places. And then you can draw that last one out and then you can just ignore that last one. Switch over to the Shadow Blade, which is a pretty cool looking weapon, as you can see there. And, uh, we'll f*** Spark Man out with it. And that's the end of Spark Man. So now here's where we have a decision to make because the Spark Shot, the Spark Shock is useful against Magnet Man. We already killed him. So now we're going to have to fight another enemy with a with our arm cannon. And that enemy is going to be Snake Man, which as I said,",

Another great design. Who knows? No one understands what Wily's actually doing except for Wily. With your bullets and his bullets, you can actually cause a lot of slowdown here too. Not that it's necessarily beneficial. Now this particular area is the only part of any of the Mega Man games I can think of that has two major or like big Health pellets right right next to each other. I never understood why that was. Like you don't need them. Okay, here there's a lot of slowdown here as well. You just like there's incredible amount of slowdown. There's just so much going on on this stage on the screen. Okay, another Hammer Joe. I love the slide and the",

I always like to think about what these what these places actually are that they're in. Like what this would look like in a 3D like space. So weird. That's why I want them to remake some of these games in 3D at some point. They wouldn't necessarily be good, but they would certainly be an interesting vision. So here's a pretty crazy jump. You can make it. It's not that bad. It's like Metal Man's jump at the end of the stage again. And that if you remember watch that Let's Play or familiar with that game. And then we're going to climb up into the sky and deal with Snake Man up here. We just got to get through this final area, which is a little",

We just got to get through this final area, which is a little tricky. Little bit of an Air Man vibe in this part of the stage. So these bullets are basically shrouded in clouds. And when you shoot them, they'll come at you. So you got to like shoot them in strategic places or just jump over them and ignore them. Yep, now we're in the, uh, the air here. All right, and we're the Snake Man. So now we're going to just fight Snake Man straight up. Depending on his pattern at this point, you know, we should be fine. Might use an E-Tank. I don't think we really need to. There we go. It's perfect. It's exactly what we want him to do. He hasn't launched any of his snakes yet. There we go. His own snakes cause crazy slowdown. That's it. Snake Man's dead. No idea what his whole thing was. Kevin Nick would make a really good Snake Man in the movie. He would, but I like",

And I think that's like one of the most clever enemies. It's two robots. Um, it's really one robot, but you'll see it makes a projection of itself. And I think that's a really just a clever idea for, uh, for a robot. Certainly one of the cool designs. So an interesting stage here. We'll meet Proto Man again in just a minute, but we won't fight him this time, which is interesting. And it doesn't matter that we fought him all those other times. He'll never fight him on Gemini Man stage. You'll just run into him. And this is when he'll kind of reveal himself that maybe he's trying to help you there. Awesome music again. Just an amazing soundtrack in this game. So here's Proto Man, but he's going to help you out. So here are these like",

I'm not going to really mess with it. We don't have to bother. So the idea, you can sit there like when I was a kid and I didn't really care about, you know, just like shoot them all cause I thought it was fun. But there's really no reason to. And you can even use them to your advantage. If you want to use, uh, the Rush Coil here, for instance, you can just jump up there and not have to deal with the whole, uh, issue of having to get them all and all that stuff. Extra life. And I think the sprites that that penguin is shooting, I'm not positive. I think those are the penguin sprites from the original Mega Man that you see on like, uh, I think Ice Man stage.

So we'll use the Rush Coil here to just jump up and grab this. And then we can we have options down here. We can use the Rush Marine. Um, actually, I'll just go back to the Rush Coil cause we'll need it again. But I'm going to try to stay on the blocks at top cause we can actually get some things up here. The problem are these fish that appear and they shoot these missiles up. And the missiles have these explosion radius plus the, oh damn, plus the fireflies that come back and forth. So we'll jump down here and get the E-Tank. And then we'll use, uh, Rush Coil to get back up. Okay. And then we'll let this firefly come and go like that. Let him fly over us. Quite precarious here.

Let's go over that. And so we're pretty much a Gemini Man stage trick here with this enemy. Obviously, it's a shooter through the wall. So have to deal with him in person. And then we'll switch to, uh, Search Snake to fight Gemini Man. You'll see what I mean. Gemini Man is true to his name. Gemini, obviously, two twins. So he appears as one and then he'll split in the two. And it's pretty cool. But we can get one of them to disappear like that by attacking him. And then he's dead. And that is Gemini Man. He gives us a Gemini Laser. Not a very practical weapon. You're only going to use against Needle Man in one other time in one of the stages. All right, all we have left to deal with is Needle Man and his needle dick. So let's go at him. Bizarre, uh, totally bizarre. I don't know what the hell he is. He's a thing. Cool enemies though here.

This probably happened to this guy. Yep, see so much slowdown. I like the stage. The music's cool. It's it's wide open, but you can also see like a cityscape in the background, which I think is pretty cool. Gives you a little like it gives you a feeling that you're fighting somewhere. It's like not just like a fantasy game, but that there's like a place that you're like trying to attack. They're taking part, you know, in dealing with in some respect. Jeez, Jesus Christ. Jeez, I'm not playing this very well, Kevin. All right, uh, Mets, Mets. Yeah, Hard Hats is what is like their, you know, the kind of vernacular. Yep, in this game. So we can use there we go.

There's only four to be carried in Mega Man 2. None in Mega Man 1. So you can see the games are getting a little easier, although I think this game's way harder than Mega Man 2 personally. And so we are here. All right, so now you got to be careful when you're using Gemini Laser. I'm going to show you why right now. It bounces off walls, as you can see here. So if you don't hit your enemy, it's just going to bounce and you can't shoot another one. Um, so you got to be very careful. Needle Man will always jump in the beginning. You can shoot and it'll bounce off the back wall and you definitely are guaranteed that hit. And otherwise, you kind of want to play it safe like I didn't just, I just",

We'll use that E-Tank if we need to. Yeah, we'll use it. It's unfortunate. You just want to basically stand on top of him to make sure the laser doesn't miss, as I just showed you. That wasn't very an elegant way to shoot it, but kill him. But nonetheless, here we are. Needle Man. Needle Man's done. Now, Mega Man 3's closest kept secret at the time, although everyone knows this now, I think, is that all of Mega Man 2's bosses are also in the game. And, and now we're going to fight them all. Um, and I loved this one. I remember, I, I'll never forget when this happened. We didn't know this was going to happen and it's so cool.

Um, so you're going to go to the four of the stages you've already been to. They're different now. They're harder to deal with. Um, and you're going to fight them and you don't know who you're going to fight here. I told you, use the Gemini Laser one more time in the game. There it was. These wheels spin, so you got to be kind of careful on them here and get a little hairy. So you just got to keep moving. All right, so to our first boss here, and as you're going to see as it comes down, it's going to be Metal Man. So Metal, I mean, so the thing about all these bosses is that they're all susceptible to multiple weapons, but, uh, Magnet Missiles works best on Metal Man.

This drop is going to be a little precarious, a little bit reminiscent of the Wily dropping Mega Man 2. And in case you're curious why I'm stopping to kill the magnets, is because you can't, you can't hit them until they come together. So they're just impervious, as you can see there. A little bit slow down again. And then so this time we're going to fight a Quick Man. Uh, and of, of course, the weapon that is, use a Gemini Laser on him if you want. He's, he's susceptible to other, uh, weapons as well, but, um, it does the most damage. I'm just going to use it here again. You're going to want to kind of really stay close to him, make sure it doesn't bounce. And that's it. So Quick Man's done. And then we move on. You can do these in any order. Um,",

It's now night time and I think it's, it's cool. Again, you can see the city in the background. It's pretty, pretty cool just for, you know, some storytelling. The needle puzzles get a little crazier though. Here you can actually stand really close to them, so it's useful sometimes. I'm messing this one up. So here we'll just use Rush. Actually, maybe I can show you how close if I can just land this jump. You can stand that close to. Now here, should you have the patience, you can get like an extra life and some other things.

Again, we're going to fight him with a, a barrage of, of peashooter and another weapon, just like we do in Mega Man 2. And you can actually slide under his, his, some of his tornadoes, which is not possible in the other game. Uh, but this time we'll use, uh, Spark Shock on him. When he gets a little closer, he's actually in pretty good shape to kill me. So I'm actually using E-Tank. I'm playing super well today, Kevin, but it's the nature of the beast. I am. So that does him in. The reason I don't use Spark Shock when he's shooting tornadoes generally to me is because they, it's just, it's bigger. Um, so it's easier to, uh, deflect.

Now, if you feel like you're going to die at some point, you might not want to grab all of those because they will not replenish. Man, oh man, having a good day here on Needle Man Stage. It's 'cause I called a Needle Man, I think. I don't know. You like that? Jeez, crazy slow down right now, man. I'm really like **** **** in the bed right now, Kevin. I'll tell you what. All right, I'm going to have to use another E-Tank. Maybe we'll see. Maybe one of these guys will give up the ghost here for me. Otherwise, I have to go back and do it again.

Yeah, I mean, this was, this started the trend of Mega Man games being twice as long as these are. But then Mega Man 9 and 10, Kevin's asking by the way, off screen, if this like, if I thought I was getting twice a game. And the answer was yes. I mean, this was a really long game, uh, for Mega Man. Um, I still think this is probably the longest one when you really think about it. Maybe not. They're all pretty. So after this, they add a second castle like, and you'll, you know, usually just go right to Wily's Castle. But like now there's in four, five, and six, there's like, I guess a castle before that.

I actually find these stages like, question, like actually harder than Wily's Castle. All right, finally, Heat Man, which, which is, uh, who is weak to, uh, the Shadow Blade.

Now we can use, uh, we could use Spark Shock on him and we will, but we don't necessarily have to. It does way more damage, as you can see. I just hit him once. One more hit and he'll be done.

            "text": "let you enjoy the ending. We'll cut me out of this so you can enjoy. But, uh, note that the ending gives you context for Mega Man 1 for the very first time, which I really love. Uh, the ending is just, is pretty cool. This is Break Man appearing, or Proto Man saves Mega Man, leaves Wily to die. That's it. So I hope you enjoyed Mega Man 3. We'll let you watch the ending in peace. And, uh, we'll see you for Mega Man 4. Remember, we're doing Let's Plays for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So you can find them all here on Kinda Funny Games. youtube.com/kindafunnygames. Thank you for joining me. Till next time.",
