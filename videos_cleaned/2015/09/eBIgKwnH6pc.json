Arena, the multiplayer mode, Slayer, new map called Coliseum. I'm ready for this. You ready? Blue team versus red team. Straight for the blue. The sniper seems to be your N de Plume, as they say. I'm backing off it. I'm feeling good. Party time is about to engage. Oh, or not. Let me just get to a safe spot. I don't. So you've never played this map before? Your first, the baby steps into spawn flopped. Spawn flopped. I love all these first-person shooter terms. He's just making up random stuff. Oh no, he was right behind me. The sniper rifle. I know it's on blue side. GG. It's still early in the game, tied up. All that man has my... I'm there. You got to get that sniper. Oh, you charged when you shouldn't. Where'd he go? He ran. Where's that dude that? Oh, okay, my teammate needed me out. Happens to the best of us. Where is the guy with the sniper rifle? Okay, good to know that. Oh.",

Oh, you got stuck. Thought I could save him. Thought I could be a hero. Oh, there you are. There you go. I take this. Oh, hello. That was a nice little elevator action, rising up. Oh, we're trying to no-scope him. Trying to do things I shouldn't try. You did it. Oh my goodness. This is definitely really fast-paced with with Sprint and uh, the dashing. Mhm. Does it still feel like... Oh, the rocket. What? Does it still feel Halo? It does. At its core, it's Halo, but it's it's it's fast-paced. It's very fast-paced. I love the animation. Oh, sniper out. Oh no. Damn it, damn. So I'm just want to let you know those power weapons, man, we're losing. Are we down by... losing game, down by five. All right, I'm to...",

D a seven, just saying. I prefer it. S up. I don't like Sprite. Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me. This dude's probably going to take it. Oh no, Alfredo. Oh no, doing the splits. The crisp Joe Johnson in that gymn movie, that gymnast movie. I don't remember what it was called. Want to know what movie that is? No, it wasn't that good. It was a Lifetime movie. Oh, all right, let's see here. I want my mic for Kevin. Thank you for watching things, Kevin. I appreciate that. Oh, that guy coming at you with the snip-skis. Where? Dropped it right there. You got it. Run. I think they're behind me. Oh, they might. That yeah, rocket on the... That was good. Get ambushed. Try to go for that power weapon. Feel like I'm going to get...",

Yeah, I mean, you're coming back. Oh, okay, okay. Is that rocket launcher still up? Oh no, we grabbed it. Thank God. Where are them reds at though? Oh snap. Oh, that guy. Oh, you're really cat... You were just chilling. We're going to this... This is the turn of the tide. Oh Lord. Oh, I should have just shot at him. You need pick up the sniper rifle though, 'cause he doesn't know what he's doing. Interesting. Bold move, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off. Team out. Is it still there though? Is it still there? Yes, it is. Yes, good ****. Oh, be careful. People are going to be flocking to you. You, they be flocking. They be flocking. You like a sitting duck up there, Alfredo. Oh, I got...

Does he have sniper ammo? I like how he just chased him down. I want, I want to know. Uh-oh, got something. Oh, I want to dash out of there. There's a sniper. That's the guy I was looking for. Down again by four. GG. Let's see if we can do this ****. Oh, I think I still have a couple shots right here unless I got... grab it. Oh yeah, go. Where they at? I wonder where their sniper's at though. Oh no, there. He's across. You got, got. I got, got. This is a very interesting map. It's still very close. Is it? Yeah, 30 to 34. Oh, uh-oh.

Keep it secret. Keep it safe. One. There's no more guy dead. I think they got him. I think we're good. I'm feeling good about this. Tied it up. Tied. Yeah, yes. Okay. Oh God. Uh, no, by two. See, now I'm getting stuck. Now I like... Let it be known, ladies and gentlemen, I play D. Nope, nope, definitely not. He's back. I need a long-range weapon. Oh, sniper's coming back up though. Oh my goodness, it's getting close. It's close. I like it though. Oh no, perfect. Okay. Oh, careful. Ooh, ooh, mama. Oh no, behind you. I'm feeling scared. Oh, oh, the trade.
