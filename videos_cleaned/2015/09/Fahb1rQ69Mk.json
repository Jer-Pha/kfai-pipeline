I'm your host Greg Miller alongside the coolest couple in video games, touch each other sexy like, yeah, one and only Nick Scarpino from Kinda Funny Games. Hi. And then of course, Christine S. Daniel to **** off from SteimerSays.com. Tell Daniel to **** off, Danielle. Oh, you're, yeah, tell your wife to **** up. I'll, I, I'm your boyfriend and I'm right here. I know, but you already know I established that's what's happening. Um, we're here without Tim and without Colin because they are sick with the Pax plague. They call it this was actually my doing. I was like, they're never going to invite me on any of their podcasts. So what I have to do is while they're at PAX, I have to just make sure that they eat something with this strain, this virus. If I can infect them, so three-fifths Kevin's sick too. If three of the Kinda Funny crew goes down, they'll have to use me desperate enough to ask it.",

One less person, one fewer person, which I should say, we'd have been screwed. We couldn't have set it up at all. So you, you, you, you calculated the perfect amount of people to knock out. Yeah, good move on her part. And it's great. Yeah. And then, but I honestly believe they would have had you rather than me on this. I'll be honest with you right there, because I am when, when you hit me, you're at below the bottom of the barrel as far. No, Nikki, we love you. I get a lot of nice comments online, people supporting. I should play games more. I should talk about games more. But my, my knowledge of games compared to you guys is so thin.

But I'm in such a glass house on that one, because I'm the guy who says roof and I just can't. And I don't even know what wrong. Fun at some point. Roof, roof. I think Colin calls dogs 'woofs'. Colin, that's funny. I think actually enjoys saying it differently. Yeah, because he emphasizes it. You know what I mean? Guess he'll put the extra emphasis on it for no reason. So he'll go, I read that book thoroughly, which I guess is actually sounds nor. What are you talking about? S, th, Thor, thorough. You don't say thoroughfare. It's like Cool Whip.

And I knew that we were going to lose Nick immediately because if there's one thing Nick loves watching on TV, it's himself. That's true. Uh, but the, the other reason why I'm watching the monitor is to check the audio levels and to make sure they look pretty recording. Well, I realized that the ISO is completely set to a ridiculously high level. There's all sorts of things I'm looking at right now. It's just the camera's gain is, is set to a level that is, is that why Christine looks so much tanner than me? Or she just really that much tanner than me in real life? No, you're just really pale.

But now Nick, you kind of stumbled a little bit upon where I want to start this episode. Um, because I think we have some interesting things. What I want to talk about and it's going to be a big question that I'll start giving you examples from so you can all get your little bite-size mandibles around it here. I want to talk about how the video game industry has changed while we've been inside it. Oh, wow. And now I asked this because we just did PAX outside of the PAX Rumble being awesome and you know, evacuating outside of everybody getting sick, all this different stuff. For me, it was this very telling system of like, man, this is like my, I mean, in the industry as far as like, you know, it would have been, this would have been eight years at IGN, right? So I.",

Um, being there and seeing how much it has changed and just in, you know, the microcosm of my own video game career, right? And the fact of like, you know, it was our, it's two years of doing the PAX Rumble now or whatever, right? And the fact that it's when we first started, it was, it was, I remember it was Tim Schafer and it was a couple other guys from Double Fine and it was me and it was Mitch from IGN and there was all the, it was developers and press and this was the one where there was so many indie developers, people I had never met before. And then Smosh Games was part of it too. And it was just like the way this is block, not that event, but PAX itself into being.",

It got me getting real nostalgic for what's happened in the timeline we've been here. And so like my career is well journaled here on Kinda Funny, right? Like, you know, I've been, I started here to write reviews and then ended up now being this video game host, right? Christine, you worked at Edelman. That was your first everywhere. Literally worked at like every single, almost every job you can have in this ind. Well, you were Edelman PR. Yep. When that, that was the PR arm for Microsoft at the time. Are they still? I think so. I think I get a lot of emails from people who Joe works there. Joe was my boss once upon a time. Um, so yeah, they still do work for Microsoft Game Studios.

Oh my God. Send all your comments here. Casey Hudson's been taking it on the chin for a long time for her. No big deal. No, no. And the meanwhile, Nick, you started in this. You fell ass backwards into it, knowing nothing about games. Well, you thought you were going to get a free pack of cigarettes if you came to this interview. Yeah, no, I, I honestly assumed I would be at IGN for just a couple years and just uh, get my resume padded a little bit and learn some stuff about production, then move on. Um, and I stayed there nine years. Were you thinking it would go more Hollywood? Yeah, I mean, I wanted to work in TV and film. Um, but I just didn't have any ends to that.

It gets a little bit easier as you get older because you make the connections and then you're always kind of working and then you're, you're turning down jobs, which is what you want. And that's kind of how people grow in the industry, right? Is you kind of, when you first start off doing anything, you kind of have to take whatever you want. The same with, right? You write for whoever you can write for. You build your resume. You get your foot in the door and you start, you start, you know, learning the skills that you need to actually start, um, to, to be successful. And so I did that with IGN.

Was playing video games. Yeah, exactly. And for me, it started because, you know, video games, I, I didn't even know to be honest, it didn't occur to me that there was video production jobs in the video game industry, right? Right. That just to me, it didn't occur to me that there were even jobs in the video game industry. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like that's one of those things where you're like, oh, people like people make these. They disappear at the sort. Yeah, it's, it's the same to make. Yeah, exactly. Um, it's very much the same if you're not really into film, right?

They still do spy like the server. No, that's done too. Yeah. So I mean, at the time, IGN, um, which I had never heard of. Isn't that crazy? I'd never heard of IGN before I took the interview. Uh, my friend worked at GameSpy, which was down in Costa Mesa. And they, uh, he worked on their backend tech. And if you'll remember, GameSpy also had an editorial side. Um, I believe Will Tuttle wrote for them. Um, Ryan Scott wrote a bunch of people. We're not doing history. Get to your point.

What I didn't realize was that that position wasn't in Costa Mesa. It was supposed to be up in San Francisco. So that's when I took the job there. I was like, ah, there are worst places to live in San Francisco. I thought I'd do it for a couple years and network a little bit and see if I could get move my way back to LA. And, and now you'll never leave. Um, I that was happened a couple times too. There was, there were some folks down in LA that used to run a reputable show down there on TV that uh, no longer exists unfortunately. That I talked to a couple times. I'm sure everyone did.

And of course you talk, you'd have fun and people wouldn't recognize your work and you'd recognize their work and you talk a little bit. Well, see now twice now you've stumbled upon what I'm driving at here in, in the beginning before I introduced the topic. You talked about the fact that you went home last night or that you don't play video games all that often. Told you to play more video games last night. You went home and played Limbo. I did. Which I think is an awesome, awesome game obviously, but an awesome step for you. Was it you who were talking to me about Limbo or is that Tim? That's probably Tim, because I actually Tim was also playing Limbo for some reason. And I think he was like, I think I ran into a game-breaking bug or something. I was like.",

He's like, well, sometimes we walk along, a little worm falls on my head and makes me go the opposite direction. I was like, that's not a bug. That's a feature of the game. That is like one of the puzzles you need to solve. I was like, no, there's, there's ways. I'm like, I can't remember what those, how to solve it right now. Uncharted. But there's, um, the light changes the direction. Yeah, yeah. So if you, if you hit a light spot, it's actually pretty, it was beautifully done because the first time you see it, you're like, oh ****, I don't know what to do. So you, you're forced to go, to go one direction, right? Not the band. You have to go in a direction, left or right.

No, Nick, every now and then I get, he's finally on a point. Christine, you can't do that to him. Yeah. Uh, anyway, so that, that mechanic is awesome. Yeah. So I mean, I came home last night and I was just like, I kind of just, which is such a huge change for you. Usually you go home and you watch Netflix and eat a burrito. I, okay, so to be fair, Portillo's here. Go get Portillo. And you taking a break? Are we stopping this? Am I just, I don't know. Christine, you decide what we do. You played it.

Yeah, PlayStation Plus. He was like, you know, you get a free game download there. Like free games to download every month. And I was like, oh, cool. I didn't know that. Same with Xbox too. Now they, they just did that this, this year, last year. I, they've done it recently. They started doing. So I went on to look for them. Couldn't find them.

We're all, we all are around each other more than anyone else. Um, and so it's, look at him. He's so cute. Did you miss us? He missed me specifically. He doesn't care about you guys.

And two is that more and more as I turn to traditional media, there's nothing there anymore for me except for a lot of they good experiences. And don't get me wrong, there's like, for instance, Fear the Walking Dead. I actually particularly like. I like episode one. Having said that though, that is still a variation on a very common theme if you look at it, right? To me specifically, because I've been so immersed in television and film for my entire life. So I watched Fear the Walking Dead. I'm like, oh, this is good because it's more of the same, but it's more of the same, right? Great cast. I could be wrong.

I was like, no, I kind of want to just sit here and like just interact with something in a different way. So I realized that I had Limbo.

And you get that. And there's, there's a power to it because there is some imagery and there, there's some juxtaposition of, of, of different elements. I don't want to spoil anything for people.

I think absolutely yes, they will, because as they're watching Let's Plays on Minecraft or they're watching their friends do that, and it's natural if their friends start progressing that they're going to start watching those kinds of videos as well. Um, what's what's crazy to me and what's what what I have to rectify in my brain is I love the passive experience. I love the experience of a film or TV show, someone choosing what to show me, um, rather than me having to interact with a game and and figure that out for myself. And again, it's shifting a little bit, but that's why I think the power of the Let's Play is so awesome because it is that passive experience and that active experience at the same time. You're sharing it, but you don't really have the burden or the stress level of having to go through the process. Yeah, um, and I think it's super powerful.

Because that's my thing. Yeah, when I come home and I'm exhausted, I I don't feel like I have it in me to play a game. I I would say I want something inactive.

I feel like I'm still kind of being productive and still indulging in that passion while at the same time I don't have to necessarily put in 90% of the effort that I normally would. And this is the same thing when I first did my first first first Twitch stream when I was still just GameOverGreggy, right?

Obviously, we are knee deep in this. This is our business now. We have to understand all aspects of or at least be up on. And I don't know if you saw this, Jimmy Kimmel put up a thing basically being like, \"I have no idea why YouTube, why would any YouTube Gaming?\" It's his first time hearing about Let's Plays. Oh, really? In live streams. And he's just like, \"I don't know why anybody...\" There's a quote out from him to the line, \"I don't know. I don't know.\" He broke up with Sarah Silverman not too long ago. Was married before that though, I think so. I don't know if he has kids. Did the kids break up the marriage?

No. And it's just like, man, like it's weird that people still don't get it to that degree that like YouTube Gaming for so many people now is going to be their first time hearing about Let's Plays and understanding what's happening. Weird. Not to mention that, you know, like I remember when I, you know, years ago when Scott Lowe was like, \"Hey, do you the Epic Meal Time guys are coming to San Francisco. Do you want to hang out with them? They they're fans.\" And I was like, \"Sure, who Epic Meal Time?\" And then like Harley's now walking around PAX and, you know, Kevin Smith movie, taking photos with Cliff Bleszinski at you talking about",

And Andre Segers from IGN at the time, who's now of uh crap, what's the Nintendo Channel? He does GameXplain, I think. Yep, GameXplain. Thank you. He was going to PAX to play Mario Kart in the Mario Kart tournament. And I was like, \"What is PAX?\" You know what I mean? Like, yeah, but that's the thing.

That that's where real gamers went, right? You didn't you like people watched G4, but that was an antiquated traditional experience at the time because you had to wait for a programming block, whereas IGN was where you went when you wanted that experience, right?

He doesn't want to talk to anybody about games. Um, so I think that to me is the most single most important factor of what's happened in the last few years is that, you know, as a as a content creator, you go out there and you build your audience and you can do that. And it's really powerful because whereas an IGN or a GameSpot might have a 50/50, you know, like to dislike ratio on what people are saying comments or there're just those people that want to come out. You have the ability to have a much smaller, focused, awesomer audience that will just support what you want to do.

And now you get to just play the things you love and just show people why you love them. Um, and of course there's always going to be one or two people that are like, \"You can't **** play Metal Gear. You're so stupid.\" But uh, whatever. That's P.O.V. between between something like an IGN or a GameSpot or anything versus what you guys are doing is that IGN and GameSpot, they're big. So like it's a little bit disjointed. They don't really have an a solid opinion on anything. So like there'll be an article that goes up that's, \"I love Metal Gear,\" and it's by Greg. And then there's another article like the next week that's, \"I hate Metal Gear,\" and it's by so and so. However, to a viewer who is not looking at bylines or anything like that, sure,",

Like, you don't have a standard opinion on anything.\" And um, so I think it's easier. Yeah, yeah, but so now people can be like, \"Well, I like Greg because he likes Metal Gear and I like Metal Gear. Therefore, I kind of know what I'm getting with you.\" Whereas the IGN is kind of a mixed bag. You're not sure who's reviewing the game, whether they liked it, what they're you. He wasn't even a real fan of GameXplain. Yeah, yeah. So there, I mean, I just think that that's probably why people are starting to break out and look at more individual contributors versus the bigger sites.

I can listen to the people I care about and get there. I can go listen to the Jimquisition and see what he's saying about this and feel like I understand. I'm my money's being put where I want.\" And it's and it's true. And that's that's very powerful too.

I wonder what they think of it.\" They're just watching us play games and go, \"Oh, I think I'm going to play that game. Looks fun in action.\" The reviews exactly as it goes.
