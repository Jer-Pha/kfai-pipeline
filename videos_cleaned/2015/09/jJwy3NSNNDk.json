I'm Greg, this is Kristine from Steimer says, and this of course is Metal Gear Solid V. Kristine, we did a let's play yesterday, it was your first time getting to see my obsession here. Yes, so like now we're back in the helicopter. We, I know, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I just serious the franchise. I don't know if that's true yet. Really? Yeah, I mean, you mean you obsessed about Metal Gear? I don't feel like I see you get this way. Infamous is another contender. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. You said this was my favorite, uh, my favorite game in the franchise is what I thought. I the franch totally fine. I apologize. I apologize. Yes, Metal Gear Solid, probably overall my favorite franchise, definitely the one that's changed my life a few times. So we ran around, we captured some guys, we killed a bunch more guys, because you wanted to see that. Now I promise you to go to Mother Base and show you my Zoo, so that's",

Now this is an animal conversation, con, conver, now you're got me, conservation platform on Mother Base. Are you familiar with Mother Base? No. I have to your live and you build it out and your mother lives there and you're doing all these things. Mother's not living there. Why not? Because we're, we're Diamond Dogs. We have no time for love or family or anything. That's what, what dogs all about family. Yeah, well, we are a pack of dogs now that roam doing what we got to do. Okay, taking care of bad guys. Now funny story, I haven't been to my conservation platform in my game yet, because I'd done it during the preview event when I originally got it. So this will be interesting. When I capture the animals out there in the wild, they get dropped here. Oh, you have a T-Rex? No T-Rex yet, no.",

I don't know, because I don't know. Oh, look, I guess I can't hop in there. Can, but is there anything in there? I don't know.

Yeah, they can fly out if they figure it out, but they're not that smart, so I don't think they will. Aren't you, wait, look around, just look around for a second, just all the way around. So this is on in the ocean. Yeah, that's where Mother Base is out there, so that's why they don't fly. Oh, there you go. Oh, hi Bears. Now that there is a po, it'd be a polar bear. That's a legendary bear I captured. Granted, I captured all these things, but that's, but the brown bear can suck it, because the white bear is way better. Idiot. Yeah, that's weird.

Well, it had some Pok\u00e9mon behind it, but I think they're definitely, definitely had the go. So this is the animal sanctuary where, okay, so we got more dogs. Yeah, worse than the other cage. Hyenas. What does it say they are? Oh, still dogs. All right, well, fair enough. I was wondering if they would be consistent on that. I mean, technically that's what they are, right? Yeah, they're, they're, they're a form of dog, dog family, K-9 family. Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, yes, bear growls. Play it. Everybody look away. You don't want spoilers. Try find it.

Oh, because it's under quired. Interesting. Okay, that's weird. There you go. Hope you enjoyed it. That's the thing I haven't done with Mother Base, Kristine, is run around and explored it.

Nope, that wasn't a ladder. I thought it was a ladder. I lied. I apologize for the lie. It's okay. It looked like a ladder. Maybe you're just in here with the bears now. This is where you live now. We got bears and a Snake. It's the world's greatest Zoo. Can you breed them? None of them to be multiply. I've only taken out two bears. There's a bear, but I know for a fact that, yeah, I've taken out a bunch of the jackals over there. So like that's why I have a whole bunch of jackals in there. You know what I mean? I need to add mating into this game. Like you a pi\u00f1ata sty. Yeah, or just straight Big Boss **** both. Now here's what I want to talk about, and this is a spoiler, spoiler.

I'm sure I'm to list or is it just somebody that you as a player love and Snake doesn't really give a ****? No, well, I mean, it could go either way, but no, like what'll be, oh, Colin's here.

She doesn't like bananas anymore, that's for sure. Why does she like bananas? Because what the inter sugar. That's every fruit.

You need to cut it off right now. Okay, wait, so you're doing endgame spoilers? Yeah. Okay, so, okay, bye bye everyone. When you, we're going to try to progress to one of the final cut scenes I haven't seen in this game, because what happens is you beat, you beat the Skullface main storyline, right? Sure.

She truly believes she's nothing more than a student living in 1974. Peace Day was a lot of fun. I hope we can do it again. She doesn't respond to anything that conflicts with her internal timeline. Doctor's pretty sure she's not faking it. If she had her memory, just think what you can tell us about Cipher. The photo was from that guy you brought back the other day from the old crew. I thought it might jog her memory, but no luck. Like a Snake's dumb eye. Anything else you can show her? Do you have something to show me, Snake? I got thousands of ****.

How would she remember you if she thinks it's 1974? So like now you've right there. You just stepped on a landmine of Metal Gear stuff. Okay, we, we met her in Peace Walker when she came in. What year is it? It would have been, I guess, 74 or whatever. Oh, okay. She came in with the professor that book she's reading when she asked her where the guy is. But she was a double agent.
