The Star Wars on PS1, Jedi Power Battles, right? Where I lent it, I lent it to Po, and he's like, I think I erased all this. And I was like, this game kind of sucks, so don't worry.

And we bought it in Sausalito, which is right across the Golden Gate Bridge. And we're playing with it. There's this, this picture of me, little four-year-old Timmy, holding my Optimus Prime. And I've never been happier. We walked back across the Golden Gate Bridge. You walked across the bridge with it? Yeah. Now, I made a mistake, guys. I made a bad mistake. Day I bought Optimus Prime, riding along the thing. This is, this is before all the suicide prevention stuff. So to be fair, even if he had gone over with the suicide prevention stuff, you still weren't getting him back. No, I know. It's not like they, someone's going to climb out.

And I remember looking down through the hole and I saw him. And I swear to God, it was the longest drop I've ever seen anything fall. And I just heard music playing in my head. Just this like sad, somber, quiet, like choir music. And just like, it honestly, Titanic hadn't happened yet, but I'm pretty sure \"My Heart Will Go On\" was playing in my head. And I just saw that Optimus, everything turned black and white. And I just saw him just fall. And it was horrifying. You start crying immediately. Immediately. It was just the worst.

And then the other thing that comes to mind, and this is just such a, it's a video thing that people that know editing video, anyone that does, it's just like, it's a school project. And it was like my biggest project I've ever done. It's days and days of editing. No nights, like sleep, just ****, just I'm doing this thing. And this is back in the days where you didn't have editing programs. You had Windows Movie Maker. And like, you had a Windows XP. If that thing even exported, you're **** lucky. And I hit export.

So every, this is when they like introduced like people are coming out and they're hot, so they're going to be hot going into the playoffs. And I'm like, **** yeah.

That reminds me of, I, I can't believe I didn't bring this up. This is actually a really traumatic, not trivial thing that like where I really lost my mind was I with that kid in your room. Oh no, no, that, that was when I was younger. When I was in tenth grade, I had, you know, I had a computer in my room and I just left it on all the time.

That's another story where I accidentally started calling Deer Park on Long Island instead of the place closer to us. And I ran up a $700 phone bill. And my dad and I went, I went up to, I was in, I was in Boston. And and my dad, my mom's, my dad called me. He's like, what did you do? And I'm like, what are you talking about? What?

I went to a place called 11 Video that used to exist to go rent like a PlayStation One game or something. And, uh, it was a thunderstorm. And I left my computer on. And I got back and the power didn't go out, but it hit phone lines and and surged my modem. Oh no, my, my internal modem. And I had to, uh, all we had was like laying around still was like an external 144 modem or something. And that was like my cousin's like 10 years ago.

Same thing, thunderstorms running through, go unplug the internet from the computer. You know what I mean? 'Cause like we didn't protectors that had, because eventually made surge protectors you could plug the internet into or the phone line into.
