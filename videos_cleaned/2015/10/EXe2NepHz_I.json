      "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome to Kinda Funny Games. My name is Colin Moriarty. Today, as promised, I'm going to play Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree's Woe and the Blight Below. This, of course, is published by Square Enix, but created by Omega Force and it's a Musou, um, much like, uh, Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors or whatever else. Um, so I'm going to venture forth here and I'm going to select my, I'm a level 1 Lucius. I played, as you can play as a male character or a female character, she will still be in your party or vice versa if you choose the other. Uh, only about 3 hours in, so I have, you know, um, something to say about the game. I'm not an expert at these games by any stretch of the imagination, so do forgive me if I'm not playing them as fluidly as you might. Um, but I did want to give you a look at this because I'm actually a huge Dragon Quest game, uh, fan rather, and one of, um, the things that I really want to do with this particular game is not write off these Omega Force type Techmo Koei seemingly very",

Um, so as you can see, first of all, I think the game's pretty and you're going to see, I mean, it's not like, you know, out of this world pretty by any stretch of the imagination, but, um, I think it is a pretty game. Um, and I just thought I would show you, uh, well, you know, let's go out to the world map and, uh, we'll just go do some battles and I'll show you what the game looks like. So here you can see some of the things like, uh, you know, these exclamation points indicate things out are left to be done. Um, so we can have skirmishes",

Um, so we can have skirmishes and all these kinds of things even though we've already been to these places. So let's do, you know what, let's go back to Arba, which is a really early part of the game and this will probably be really easy, but we can at least have a skirmish here. We're going to find Hammerhoods, slimes, maguses, skeletons, and Drackys, so very familiar Dragon Quest enemies. My phone is ringing, so I'm just going to throw that on the ground. Okay, understood. Take on this challenge? Yes, let's go. We'll show you exactly what the game's like. So we'll do a couple of these and then maybe we'll continue the story and do like a story mission and you can see they're pretty much all the same. Lots of enemies, hundreds and hundreds of enemies, just maybe thousands of enemies depending on the map you're on, just hacking and",

So I have my party with me here and, uh, I can look at the map if I want. You can see the red dots here are represent enemies and you can see it kind of in the upper corner. So let's, let's just, you know, beat the living **** out of these guys. So you can see I think the enemies look really, really cool. Um, these are obviously all very familiar classic sorts of enemies, um, in Dragon Quest, slimes especially, but obviously the skeletons and Drackys, these are all very familiar enemies too. So the, the one thing I'll say about this game having not played nearly enough of it to have any sort of comprehensive critical opinion on it is that I can't imagine that this game is going to appeal much to you if you are not a Dragon fan. None of this means anything to you. These",

Um, maybe even some of these locations or characters, uh, you know, obviously the art style might not, uh, resonate with you if you're not a Dragon Quest fan. But me being a very much a Dragon Quest fan, super annoying, um, in terms of the aesthetic. Um, so these party members I have with me, um, can be switched in and out and also these tokens mean something. I'll show you what those mean in a minute. Um, but if I press L, I can switch around to characters and use them in their skills. So she uses like a boomerang for instance. Um, if I switch to her, she kind of uses a sword and shield attack and the King here, this King character uses like a staff has all sorts of special attacks as well, but I actually prefer just to use the main",

You can make it more complicated for yourself by using some tactics, um, and some more complicated button combinations, but I just don't really feel like that adds to the, to my enjoyment of the game personally. I might add to yours, that doesn't really do anything to me. It's not the complication or lack th the game that's really the problem, it's more the repetitiveness. So you can see here a new horde of enemies, um, has appeared and I have to deal with them and they're kind of congregating here in the center, so we can head back and I'll show you one of these tokens. So the tokens on the bottom, you can see the slimes and the skeletons there. I use the D-pad to kind of go between them left or right and then to, um, summon them I",

I use the D-pad to kind of go between them left or right and then to, um, summon them I press up and to dismiss them I press down. So they'll attack for me. So I can just put a slime right here. I'll just put a slime right here that will fight on my behalf and he'll just kind of hold his ground and stay there and you can only carry at least right now six tokens. Some of the characters are so strong our monsters that they take two or three slots up, so that doesn't necessarily mean you can carry six enemies at once although you probably can. You can carry up to six slots at once if that makes any sense. So let's grab a skeleton here, we can throw him down and he can fight on your behalf. So here's our friend the skeleton and he'll kind of just, his name is Vagabond, which is quite cool. Here we have a Dracky token we can grab, actually I can't grab it cuz I'm out of room, so we'll drop another",

Here we have a Dracky token we can grab, actually I can't grab it cuz I'm out of room, so we'll drop another skeleton, actually a slime. Oh, I see, okay, there we go. Serve me well because one of them needs to be dismissed, so we get rid of him, pick up this Dracky here and we can, actually I'll need to dismiss one more, get rid of him there. So the Dracky you see here takes up two slots. It seems like the enemies are congregating more in the center here, so we probably should get back to the center. You can jump using A, of course, get a little crazy with it if you want. So here let's use the, uh, summon the Dracky on our behalf. One cool thing you can do and I'll show you, um, the purple meter here next to my guy to the left of his icon on the bottom left corner of the screen, um, I want a Magus actually, so let's get rid of some of these guys get, um, that will fill up and allow me to do some special attacks",

So let's get rid of these spell casters as you can hear, I hope if you're a Dragon Quest fan, lots of familiar noises and sounds. I, I really like that. I mean this in terms of the way it treats Dragon Quest fans, I think this game is really, really neat. Can I, there's any, it says there's enemies over here, I guess they're up there though. Oh, the stairs, okay. So here we're getting pretty close to being able to fill up this purple metering searing and everyone's kind of just dropping stuff for me to use if I want. I the things in the little pouches unless there's like a herb coming out of it, um, which would indicate it's like a healing herb, these pouches are items that you can use to synthesize new items, um, which is not something gotten too",

So let's go up the stairs here and see if we can get rid of, uh, these guys since they're just lingering. Yeah, these maguses are just waiting to cast some spells and you can interrupt their spell casting although not all enemies can be interrupted. A new horde has appeared as you can see here as I just flash on the screen. There's one more enemy up here, I think there he is. That jar, uh, would be MP. I can use magic by holding down the R1 button and then using, um, an attack in that fashion. So I only have one spell right now because I'm not really been investing in that. It's called Infernal Flash, uh, Slash rather, pretty powerful. You can see here INF get rid of a bunch of enemies at once. So new hordes are appearing and I have to deal with them quickly. I'm pretty thorough",

I'm pretty thorough. You can actually let some of these enemies linger if there's like one or two enemies left. I just hate looking at my HUD. I think you guys can, your OCD Gamers out there, you can kind of relate. Um, don't want to leave anyone just kind of hanging around INF. So lots of hordes are appearing. I got to kind of deal with these guys. These guys are being aggressive here. They're coming at me quick. All right, so let's use, I'm going to use my circle attack. This will bring me to a special mode where I don't take any, um, death damage and I don't think I use any MP and stuff like that and then I can execute at the end of it, um, like a super special attack if I want, um, that will kind of engulf everyone on the screen.

This attack here which I'm like not in any range of any enemies unfortunately to use and then I basically just refill, um, the gauge and go again. Now the interesting thing about that of course is, um, that you can execute that once you hit the circle button by hitting Circle again, um, otherwise it'll be used automatically which is what happened to me there and you better be careful that you know you're in a good spot otherwise it's kind of going to be uselessly used which is unfortunate. So let's kill some of these slimes. Look like we're thinning the h a little bit, but I don't know how long it'll last. Let's kill the Dracky there. We head out this way. My friend Oald is still hanging tough. I appreciate kill those guys there seems like the biggest amount of enemies is probably over here.

Inferno Slash. You can also see in the corner I'm building up, you know, hit combo and all those kinds of things that will help you build meter quicker. You got this item and because these enemies because this is such an early part of a of uh level, um, the enemies are not giving me much experience and I'm not, um, quickly vanquishing them either. I frankly probably should have used that meter a little more wisely, maybe what I really should be doing is using some of my friends here a little more wisely as well.

So lots of new enemies appearing although fighting these enemies doesn't really hurt because it's you know it's helping me build meter and doing all these things so and my experience although not you know very slowly the yellow bar underneath my MP meter is um Inferno my experience meter. Oh my God, there's like so many enemies Inferno Slash. So we're starting to call him a little bit my friend Magi Magi Yoso I guess his name is or something of this is doing his damndest. It's unclear to me whether like you have to be quick and I'm sure you know people watching this probably like shaking their heads maybe knowing the answer to this but I just don't um if it's like about speed the hordes come if you can like if there's you know if there's like a finite am out",

All right, so my meter's all filled up where I can use my special attack again, but I'm not going to do that quite yet cuz I want to make sure I'm in a good spot this time to do that. Inferno Flash searing slash. So let's use a spell here to kind get rid of some of these guys and then I'm going to go down here and challenge these dudes got more wh so many of them little ridiculous steing slash. So let's go back and see what we can do hit Circle maybe H little too early and see if we can just use our special attack here to get rid of some of these guys on mass a little bit of clipping there considering where I'm using",

I don't know if this is going to end any anytime soon. I'll give it another minute or two if not I'll exit out is the game told me I can leave at any time and keep my experience and my gold and stuff like that which is nice so you don't feel like you're wasting your time even if you die. I think you um I haven't died yet but I think if you die you keep everything you've earned as well which is you know nice oall doing his damndest hold his ground Inferno Slash searing slash.

You, a lot of you out there probably know more about this game than I do. Excuse me, and then I have seven left, so let's see what I can do with seven points.

So HP, MP, and strength and then we'll also go ahead and raise his resilience to attacks. And then Ell with Five Points, let's see what we can do here. Is there anything that's worth five?

I don't know if that's something that's appeared since then. I couldn't really tell you. Um, these Mo keepers are actually an interesting thing though. So these portals that these Mo Keepers create will allow monsters to continually come out, so you have to destroy them as quickly as you can.
