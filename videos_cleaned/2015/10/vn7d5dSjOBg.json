Before moving in, she knew I was a big gamer and I would love spend hours playing video games. Since we've been living together, I've been noticing her getting more annoyed with the amount of time I play games. What's the best way to manage playing time and spending time with your significant other? I love her and want to make her happy, but I also want to spend time doing something I'm passionate about. You do have to allow time for yourself in a relationship. I think that's very, very important. I think it's very important that you not compromise who you are just to make someone else happy. Um, having said that, are you playing video games for 10 hours every night? Cause at that point you might want to just back it off a little bit. Balance is the key word here. You got to make sure that you're having you time, you also need the us time, and you also need the her time if you want",

You got to make sure that you're having you time, you also need the us time, and you also need the her time if you want the relationship to work. You have got to give up a little something to get something bigger. That's how relationships go. So if you want to play Metal Gear for 10 hours over the weekend and she needs to run some errands, well, you have to ask yourself, do I want to be in a relationship and do I want this to work? And if that's the case, then maybe you have to find that what they, I hate this word and everyone hates this word, you have to find a happy compromise because that's what relationship is about. And you're not compromising your integrity, you're not compromising who you are. You are giving up just a little bit of that selfishness for the betterment of your relationship. And I think the biggest thing is there isn't any rules to this and none of it is ever going to make sense. It's not like, oh, if I",

It's not like, oh, if I spend this much time with her, I get this much game playing time. It's just more of a, you have case-by-case basis. You got to feel it out. You got to know where she's at at all times and kind of just go off of that. Right, right. And having said that, also, you know, it's important that you open, you open up that dialogue and have that conversation with her because if this is something that's important to you, she probably has something that's important to her too. And there's nothing wrong with doing things separately. And this is a big problem I think a lot of young people have is that they always think they have to be glued to each other's sides, but in reality, you need your own life. You have to go off and you have to live. You have to have these experiences to bring back to the relationship even when",

You have to have these experiences to bring back to the relationship even when you're married, even if you've been married for years. I think another key thing that a lot of people try to do is make the you time us time. So it's like, oh, well, I'll just get her to like video games and then we'll enjoy it together. Don't do that. Like, let her like what she likes and if she does end up liking it, leave that up to her. You can't force that upon her. You can't ask that of her. You just got of kind of let things happen and enjoy what you enjoy and let her enjoy what she enjoys. Right. Absolutely.
