I guess it has almost been a year. Hold on, I almost got it, got it. What is this? What was that? I was playing Super Meat Boy. Super Meat Boy. The coolest dudes in video games, Greg Miller and Colin Moriarty. I usually go the other way. It's good to be here with you today. You know, decided to give Greg a little little extra shot Greg needs. I noticed his ego is getting smaller, which I didn't think was possible. Um, so we have to definitely inflate it some more. You didn't think it was possible for it to get smaller? No, or bigger? Just it's expanding at the speed of light. Nothing can possibly expand any quicker than that. You know, Greg's red-shifting. I I was telling you this earlier, Greg, I like your shirt more now than I used to. Yeah, you know, you pointed out today that the the shimmery parts have worn off on this PlayStation shirt.

I think that uh, yeah, that's what turned me off to the shirt originally. Yeah, 'cause I like the shirt a lot. I would have loved it if it was like black and then white, just white. Oh, just I would even love it with just the Japanese text and not the PlayStation logo. That's just to make it really obscure. Wow, yeah, that'd be crazy. Like when they sent out, it says PlayStation. Remember when they had the rewards program? They sent out the rewards shirt that was in Japanese that was like, thank you for supporting PlayStation, or it said PlayStation, I forget. But you don't read Japanese, so you I read Japanese. I'm telling you it has PlayStation. You don't read Japanese, definitely. You barely read English, definitely not. Remember uh, years ago",

And I'm like, no, but that would be pretty cool if I did. And I like, and then I was like, I should learn Japanese so I can tell women that I infect. You could have just lied to her. You're a good dude, you didn't lie to her. You could have straight up lied to her. 'Cause why did she ever going to say, what does it say? Well, I could have been like, everybody, it says Everybody's Golf. Yeah, and then this says start, and this says options. And you you hit start and it just reformat the entire card.

Pretty good. No idea what it is or where it is. You hit me up and said, do I need anything from Sprouts? And I assumed it was a grocery store, but I wasn't sure. There's two different ones. There's one up in like San Rafael or whatever that is. I go to with Cheryl sometimes. And then there's one in Daly City by The Habit, which is a great burger place that is just it it is obnoxious whenever there's a new place that opens up that's been everywhere else. Everyone like rushes it. The Habit still, I have never been there when there's not a line that's just like, it's good, it's good. It's not that good though.

So what I'm saying is that for seven or eight bucks, you can get a burger and fries and a drink at The Habit that is at the level of I would say $15 Burger. Ooh, ooh, that's a little high, but I get that. They're curly fries. They they have curly fries. They have they have chicken and s- the the thing is that it's it's friendly to to people that don't want to eat beef. Those are fucking weirdos. They are. I don't get them. I'm not friendly to those.

There's just so many and it's just like I feel like between us we've been kind of dividing and conquering. We haven't talked about it. It's just kind of happened.

Let's start with the the Battlefront beta. Colin, you played it half an hour. I call it a return to form for you in Let's Plays where you were funny. Nick was there. You guys were popping off each other. You're having a great time. Am I usually miserable and shitty on Let's Plays? No, you're very very very Collegiate Professor level.

Those things were funny, but with Battlefront, I'm like, I'm not going in with any expectations of being confident. I was way more competent than I thought I was going to be. That's 'cause that's 'cause we were all starting on the same level right now. And I'm also better at games than I give myself credit for in terms of the online sphere. No, it's not even that. I just think it's the fact that, yeah, I agree. I said it was crazy. I don't mean 'cause you're bad at it. I just mean usually 'cause first-person shooter kids are crazy like good. This is Early Access. I think I'm actually good at shooters, but I'm used to playing against AI, kind of predictable things like Uncharted, even though it's a third-person shooter where like, yeah, like they well, like you shoot him and then they like like shift over so you like shoot like, Jesus Christ, stop moving.",

I just shot you right in the gut. Yeah, like go down, you're dead. Um, so all right, so Battlefront. So yeah, we played uh, the the the Hoth map, that kind of famous Hoth map during Battle of Hoth in Empire Strikes Back. And actually the thing that I liked about it the most, and I I know this is kind of their thing obviously, when they're showing Vader running around, you know, and we saw that with our own eyes that Vader was was It was kind of cool was that it's it's just very fanservicey. And I think that it's part of it's a little weird and part of it's kind of cool. Like uh, what's a good example? Like I flew in a TIE fighter. I just found a TIE fighter power up and I flew in a TIE fighter and I was fighting an A-wing. A-wings were not at the Battle of Hoth, but like it's it's but it's but it's cool",

And uh, I was like, okay, this is kind of neat. Like there's just a lot of like weird things you can do in the game. I didn't see like any B-wings or Y-wings or anything like that. But but like they're throwing things in there that don't make really a lot of sense. Like I'm a Snowtrooper, then suddenly I'm flying a TIE fighter. And no wonder I'm not flying it very confidently because I'm a fucking Snowtrooper. Um, but I think it's fun. There's like it's just it's beautiful. It ran well. I mean, from what I was seeing, it ran perfectly fine. Connection issues? Uh, no, I had no connection issues. The load times were fine. Um, frame rate was steady.

The one thing that uh, not that it would be uncommon in a Star Wars game is that there's no ammo, which is like something I have to get used to. Like you're you you're pulse, you're pounding. I mean, from what I could tell, you're you're using your gun. If you just hold it down, then your gun overheats. But otherwise, like you let the meter go back down, you can just kind of use it. But that makes sense since they don't have ammunition in that universe. They I guess have power packs or whatever. But um, question, I like I like it. Based on what you played, are you still concerned? Leading into this one, you were you were telling everybody, you know, it's DICE, they've had problems before. Are you concerned about this one?

So it's like the the um, and I'm not saying that's going to happen. I'm saying that has happened in the past. Yeah, uh, no, this game's going to get the server crush on this and load is going to be fucking monumental. Um, and I'm I'm interested to see how they can handle it. It's not it's going to be like Call of Duty levels. Activision is used to that though. I'm not sure that, you know, I don't know that the exact sales numbers, but my assumption is that this will sell more than any Battlefield game. Uh, Battlefield is a very popular game.

It's very smooth. It's very slick. That's interesting to me 'cause it's like, you know, a lot of people seeing the reaction to you playing this game.

So there's a little there's something a little off. But okay, but like, let's like Snowspeeders can't go into space. Yeah, you know what I mean?
