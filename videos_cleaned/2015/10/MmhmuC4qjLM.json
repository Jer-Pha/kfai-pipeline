Now Nick, yes, you're here for a Monumental moment. This is my first, this lovely blonde here on the screen is Taylor Swift. She is my hunter, she is level 5, we have 115 in the light stuff here. How long did it take you to just cuz you nailed it? Yeah, she looks exactly like Taylor. Thank you, thank you. Um how long did that take you? Not long.
