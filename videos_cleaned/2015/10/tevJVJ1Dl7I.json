We'll read it on the show. These are all geared towards Mr. Adam right here. I saw a few of these. Yes. Okay. So you can prep for it. Yes. This starts with our boy Sean Pitts. He wants to know \"What are you playing right now and what are you looking forward to this year?\" Um I'm playing Metal Gear Solid now. Um I'm slowly making my way through it. Uh I'm really looking forward to Fallout 4. That's a big surprise. I'm actually I'm really looking forward to Halo 5. Um I I I like Halo and this looks like this is being done with a lot of care and attention. So I can't wait for Halo 5. Ratchet 3 wants to know \"What's your most anticipated 2016 game?\" Uh Mass Effect Andromeda. Yeah I hope it hits. if it doesn't come out. I mean that that really is a gaping hole in my heart.

I think that's a good that's gonna be a good fall 2016 game. Yeah. Marzel Marzel wants to say wants to know predict how PSVR and Oculus Oculus Rift and VR in general will impact gaming in 2016 and beyond. Um I'm very excited about VR. You know I've been working with this company. I know people who are working on VR games. Um I think there's a ridiculous amount of potential. I still don't know if games are going to be the biggest significant thing out of the gate or if it's going to be like live entertainment. I to be honest I'm so excited to be able to maybe pluck out $500 and get a front row seat for a prize fight because I will never afford that seat in real life. And this is there's something I think that's there's so much potential there. I think that we're gonna see some really neat games but it's",

I think that we're gonna see some really neat games but it's gonna take a while because it is a different medium. And both from an economic point of view unless it's Oculus or Valve making the game everybody else is going to need to do two SKUs. And I think a game for a console is not going to work as a game for VR that it's it's it's a much different experience. You almost don't need the same level of challenge. I have a buddy of mine who's working on Narcosis that has a VR version. Oh yeah. Yeah. We've done that. David Chen. And one of the thoughts I had when I was in it is I wasn't looking for combat or the scary. I've never been in a submarine underwater. The sheer novelty of that is so strong that you can you have to I think you can rethink what's going to be happening that I don't think I need as much gameiness in my VR experience or at least",

Maybe we'll become so jaded to it as the years go on. We need to have something that's more deeply interactive and challenging to make it happen. I think Sony's is the biggest bet because it is tied to the console. If they can pull it off all power to them. I I see a little bit more risk there. Obviously the Valve and the um and the initiative from from Oculus they are backed by some very very large companies that are that that are doing pretty well. And so the price point for Sony and you know the fact that their install base will have to be people with the PlayStation 4 there's some really interesting pros and cons there. Mhm.

Ben Benicrock says \"If Adam could adapt any novel to be a video game what would it be?\" Like I saw this one. I've been thinking about it. I I think the novel I would want to be play is something by Joseph Conrad. I probably Lord Jim you know especially because it does get really exciting at the end because the evil Captain Brown he's coming with his bad people and they're going to try to take over and here's Jim. He's finally made something good in his life you know after being a horrible coward earlier on. Um yeah.

Or maybe like a Joseph Conrad open world game where just you know you just travel from one bad decision to the next. Conrad wrote Heart of Darkness right? And so Spec Ops the line is basically Heart of Darkness. So there's a there's another Conrad game. You're right. I I think the thing is he he did Heart of Darkness. He actually does other versions of Heart of Darkness better like The Secret Share and stuff like that but Lord Jim which is less he did there's two books he wrote that I just love. There's um there's Lord Jim which is less about you know how evil you can be but like kind of the dangers of male pride. He did an oven called The Secret Agent which is the most viciously funny. It's about an anarchist in London and he's not very good at being an anarchist and just these horrible chain of events that that he sets in motion. So cool.

Oh that was Oh that was Heavy Rain. Cutting off the finger. I was like I don't know. I got to go I go outside to think about this. My wife's like \"What's up?\" I was like I don't know if I should cut off my finger or not. Um well it wasn't Witcher because they don't they mean some of those are timed but this did happen recently. What What What was another recent choice game? Anything from Telltale game? I haven't played Telltale lately. Okay. What are choice based? Dragon Age. Yeah I think it was Dragon Age. Mhm.

Joey Ferris says \"What was it like doing the Bethesda E3 press show with your former Xplay co-host Morgan Red?\" That was so awesome. Um there there's one other element to it that there's no reason for anyone other than people who worked at G4 to know. Not only was I doing that with Morgan but the floor director was the floor director for Xplay. And so it just it was weird. All of a sudden it felt so normal and familiar. Yeah. You know the one thing that was most important is Morgan and I still had to stand in the same positions because one time they tried to actually m mix us up on Xplay and I",

So I mean it was so wonderful and comfortable but then especially with the floor director um Andy I had gone out to the back to have a smoke break which I would do all the time on Xplay and he came out goes \"Adam when you're done they need you back there.\" And it was exactly what had happened three years earlier for all these years. And it really was it was so much fun to And also it was really fun to do it for Bethesda. They're they're dear friends. I obviously love their games. Like the whole thing felt right.

The part I miss the most is what I'm doing right now is I got to go into a place of work whether other people is like absurdly fascinated by the same thing and we could just talk about it all the time. Um because yeah my wife does not want to hear it. She's she's the only other person that's inside. Sorry the Riddler trophies are so annoying. Ben Parish wants to know what your favorite sketch or character on Xplay was. Um God there's so many I liked. I know someone brought this up. I I had nothing to do with it other than laugh at it but was Roger the Stanley Experience. Um Mr. Goodman Mike Leler who played a stand-up comic version of Stan Lee.

Um but yeah I think I think for me personally that I think it's when we did the um the Vegas we we went out into the desert and we were looking for that because that was the first time we took a gamble on doing one of these crazy ass episodes where we spent a lot of money we blew stuff up and it really seemed to hit with the audience and it became a definition for the show. It's great. Desane too wants to know \"Would you ever write a book about the video game industry? You seem to know a lot and are very well spoken.\" Yeah but I don't think it'd be very interesting.

Sure. There actually is a project I've been knocking around. I've been showing to some people so I'll just leave it at that. Yeah I like that a lot. M Clemens Jr. says \"How is enjoying the quiet semi-retired life?\" I imagine him being a gaming by fireplace with a pipe in his mouth type of guy. Yeah. No. Yeah. There there's nothing semi-retired about I like daddy needs to still be bringing home some bacon. I just didn't want to do it from the way I've been doing it before. Um it's fun. It's terrifying.

So you like let them all sort of like spin out and you don't get them the right attention. I'm still struggling to find that perfect balance but there's some things coming up in the future that might make people happy. Final thing is not a question just a statement. Confucious 90 says \"If it's possible just tell him from me that I love him.\" A a Oh Confucious. So not friendly.
