Yes, yes, I did great. Well, we can start whenever you're ready. So what exactly are we doing? We're going to do a scan of your brain then we build a computer model of it and bombard it with stimuli. The program will help us to quickly iterate your treatment plan until it's fully optimized in short develop the perfect treatment for your condition. So it's not just a study this will actually help me I should hope so otherwise this would be a huge waste of time. You know what this light's making me uncomfortable.
