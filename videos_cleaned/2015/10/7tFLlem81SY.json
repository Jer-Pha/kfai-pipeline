Uh, I wasn't on the last episode or maybe last two episodes, uh, because I was gone for a while. I had to go home. My best childhood friend, Mike Pop, had gotten married and, and, uh, so I went to. We across street from each other and about. That is Mike Pop aware of how many times he name checked on the show? Watch it or? He has no idea. Actually, does watch this stu- he do? Um, actually think r listens to it. I w camera and said he but, uh, so Mike and I grew up across street from each other and, and I I had so to give some context, like I had grown up on the island. I was born and raised there and then I was in th grade. I moved to New England for five years and I would only spend summers on the island and then I moved back and my dad sold our old house and bought a new house and I moved across street from Mike, who was this guy I knew and we became very close friend.

He married this really nice girl, um, Cassandra and, uh, so I had to go to Connecticut and where her her family, um, her like her step family is very wealthy. They have this beautiful estate in like the middle of nowhere, just woods and, um, it was awesome and, uh, no service, but I was with a bunch of my old friends, um, and one of them is a professor now in college and he brought up this. We were we I was basically just drinking the entire time I was there, like one would do when you have no service and we're staying in this house from 1730 and we would just sit in this around this fire pit outside of it and chairs and just like chat about things until, you know, all hours in the morning and he brought up this thing that I thought",

I want to explain you what it is and then I I want to ask you what you think of it. It's called the Omphalos hypothesis and it has another name and get to that in a minute. And the hypothesis is the argument. This is according to Wikipedia, this will be the best way to boil it down is the argument that God created the world recently in the last 10,000 years in keeping with flood geology, which you would know about went to Catholic school, but complete but complete with signs of great age. Okay. So you guys understand that in other words, the argument that God created the recently but complete with signs of great age.

So put in the fake exactly disy really good brush it says the idea saw some revival in the 0th century by some creationist who extends the argument to light that appeared to originate in far off stars and galaxies. Many creationist believe that Adam and Eve had no navies and that the trees in the Garden of Eden had no growth rings. So this is like a creationist kind of idea held by some people that believe in in the young Earth that it's so young, but that they acknowledge that there are signs that make it seem like it's old, but it's not. So if you were to cut down a tree in the Garden of Eden, there would be no rings in it or Adam and Eve weren't born from anyone. Eve was from Adam's rib and Adam was created by God. So they have no navy since there was no and so that kind of stuff. Okay, I'm trying to find.

So, um, it says, when did false history begin? This is what Wikipedia says and this is what we were talking about. It says they're talking about an arth Nam Ghost and they say, although Ghost's original hypothesis specifies a popular creation story, others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as 5 minutes ago, including including memories of times before created in situ. The idea is sometimes called last Thursday as in by its opponents as in the world might as well have been created last Thursday.

Sorry, noad finish before we start and this is one of my big things. They have on Wikipedia says a fake creator says from a religious viewpoint, it can be interpreted as God having created a fake such as illusions of light in space or stellar explosions that never really happened or volcanic mountains that were never really volcanes in the first place and never actually experienced erosion. The conception therefore drawn reb from some theologians, um, and then it says to make I say the show never happened false meme of this show.

It's like, well, you don't know that the earth wasn't created 5 minutes ago actually based on the same exact principle and I'm curious what you guys think about. Hold on, that that doesn't make sense. Although because it's a hypothesis, right? That it wasn't then we do know it was 5 minutes ago, you know, the memory can be implanted in your brain.

This is the only real thing yoube.com of funny and figure it out that could be the same thing like God could have just put that there just like you put the dinosaur bones, just like you put the volcan that never actually erupted and the tree that has no rings in it. So he still put signs no the idea. So he's making up as he goes. The idea is I guess the principle curious think about this is that the 10,000 year old thing is completely arbitrary. It could have been any time because like because the argument is like did Adam and Eve have Adam specifically has false memories? Did he know that he was created? Did he know that he didn't have a navy and that was weird, you know, like me, I don't think he was thinking about that. I've never once thought about my belly button.

The idea to me was that I mean, I think people can interpret it in different but to me I was curious about what you guys thought about it was it says to me that faith is probably arbitrary because there's there's another quote in here that I think is really interesting. Um, let me find it here. Yeah, so this is from I don't know some writer says God created God essentially created two conflicting accounts of creation, one in nature and one in the Torah.

One could equally claim that it is nature which presents the real story and that the t tested us with a previous history. My is why what's the point of that isct what this is of what I drew out of our conversation yeah when I was you know 7000 be deep this this was the question I wasing which wasn't just indicating to us that this is all nonsense like why would God trick us at all? I don't know because like it's kind of fun, you know, they red shift, which is a which is how we know that everything's moving away from us in right space like things shift, you know, the um spectrum shifts red when things are moving",

I like people there's religion i it's right or wrong to believe in organized religion at all or in anything. I mean, I'm not going to sit here and be like your belief structure is incorrect or wrong.

Because what they're doing is you're taking the idea of \u200b\u200blogic and just basically throw it out the window for allens purposes. If I'm not mistaken, you cannot thing that is canot be proven me logic or anything therefore we're always right, but inverse talking about is the inverse argument is or you're always wrong. Yeah, you sound like we're like God's boyfriend or girlfriend so just like no matter what we defin God's boyfriend because no matter what God says he's always right and we're always wrong.

It's you know what that reminds me of is a conversation we had a week or two ago talking about Elon Musk where you were talking about the two questions that he asks people interested ideas to put him in a room with a creationist and be like because of the his we're in a freaking simulation and no one knows how long the uh the world's been around, right? Like are we in the simulation? Does that matter? Can we ever prove that or just prove that?

It's the same it's the same exact thing. We have no idea that last Thursday actually happened, right? IDE right people do Earth. I'm not judging we relig lot of Christians for instance I speak for that maybe I know best do believe the Earth is 5 billion years old and like believe that the universe is 13. or 13.5 billion years old and do believe that you know there were dinosaurs and that humans are only 100,000 years old or so and st like that.

Oh, I'm sry Kevin's not m with picture. Kevin is the most by far distracting element on just do your job and he'll do his swear to J and do his J swear to earlier.

I mean there's things in it that are ridiculous but the old the Old Testament is just completely ridiculous everything about and BS the story itself is just totally out of sequence anyway like they're creating things out of order compared to like the way the natural order like the way like the way a planet sun would be creating and then the planets around it and all that kind of stuff and then people are like well it's just it's just a story it's just you know I'm like",

Right now, but with the Bible, especially with the Old Testament, these things were copied like this was 15 500 3000 years before Gutenberg, right? So this was like there was no printing press. Nothing you had to copy them, copy them, copy them, copy them, copy them over and over and over and over and over over again. And then you get to this point to a point where you can really believe that the",

And then you get to this point to a point where you can really believe that the copies are the right. So like maybe like after the church was founded, but so like early AD or whatever, but like it's the only thing that gets away with like no provenance. We have no idea who the the we have no idea where it came from. And even like in the New Testament as we talk the gospels even contradict each other, you know, like in certain places it's like it's remarkable that like we look for provenance and and and and logic and everything, but we don't look for it here. And that's why I thought this thing was interesting because it's saying like if you believe the literal version of this, then there's no reason to believe that this shouldn't happen literally 5 minutes ago. There's no reason to believe that the universe wasn't created last Thursday and I thought that that was an",

We talked in the past it's clear the Roman histor talk about definitely did exist but maybe we can learn from these different things and live a better life but let's not be let's not talk as if we know that these things really happened because we don't.

We believe it and that and that is that is you know that's where this came from so I want to bring it up. Yeah, it's a slippery slow it's a dangerous slow because th the argument I would take on the oppos side of the devil's advocate was well you don't know that that's just and that's last Thursday ths crazy and that's why it's and that's the beauty of the thing is that it's so frustrating because you cannot disprove it but you cannot that's the whole point that's the idea that was what was frustrating heart that's the point I can't disprove the Old Testament either because if I look at a star that's",

I think we look at religion and religious text too literally and I think that even if you don't look at them literally we should just try to learn good things from them and and kind of understand that they have no provenance.",
