I am one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer, seducer, Nick Scarpino. Top of the morning to you, Greg. Top of the muffin to you. It's the afternoon. You just ate an apple. I did. I made a little bet with myself to see how far I could get into the apple before we actually started the show, because there's a lot of shenanigans that happened before this, right?

You look like Hugh Jackman from Swordfish. Yeah, great movie. And Kevin's like, \"Hey, Greg.\" And you just know when he, when he starts off with, \"Hey,\" it's over.

From the earliest periods of Egyptian history, all Egyptians were buried with at least some goods that they thought were necessary after death. At a minimum, these consisted of everyday objects such as bowls, combs, and other trinkets along with food. Wealthier Egyptians could afford to be buried with jewelry, furniture, and other valuables, which made them targets of tomb robbers. In the early Dynastic Period, tombs were filled with daily life objects such as furniture, jewelry, and other valuables. They also contain many pottery and stone vessels.

I mean, there's a lot of good Tears for Fears stuff. Um, Missing Persons Real Life. These are good bands to listen to if you like New Wave. Uh, Stone Temple Pilots Purple and Core, two great records, really seminal records. Green Day Kerplunk, Dookie, Nimrod. Um, if you really, really want to listen to 311, I would start with Grassroots to a Sound System. Can't go wrong with either of those albums as are very true albums to their sound.

Focus your attention on the victims and their families in helping them recover, end quote. Federal law enforcement officials nevertheless identify the shooter as whatever his name is.

So like my gut reaction is it's just like, I mean, immediately I'm like, yeah, just name him because that's the news. Yeah, but then the moment I see someone gets upset about it, it's like, why are you naming? We should focus on the victims. I'm like, oh, I totally agree with that. We should focus on the victims. Why are you giving this guy any attention? You know what I mean? I guess it's one of those things where it's like things kind of trigger. You see, you see each one, each side of the argument.

A lot of the conversation turns toward why did he do it? What was, you know, was he suffering from a mental disability? Was it an upbringing thing? We're, we're looking to try to figure out reasons why these things happen so that we can potentially avoid them in the future.

What were the circumstances that led up to this that we could potentially glean some insight from that might, may or may not help prevent the next one?

Like it's true that, yeah, but how do you fix that? Like to my point is like, if you're out there and you're, you're depressed or you're, you're having these thoughts of like potentially wanting to go out and commit a crime or or hurt yourself and you see this person that's done it and you understand what led him to it. If someone were to go on and say this person was suffering from bipolar disorder or severe depression, it was on the wrong pill or needed, you know, needed this treatment that he could have gotten but didn't get.

And this is what was driving me **** crazy on the day is that this wasn't what you're talking about is a bigger feature, you know what I mean, of what's going on, how these people get their guns, you know what I mean? The guy who shot the, the reporter and the interview subject and the cameraman from where he used to work, right? That wasn't even a gun he stole, he had his own gun. This is a different thing. This, when you're talking about features down the road, that's when I, I feel like, okay, maybe we don't need to bring up the name, we don't need to do this. This is spot news. I think it's, I think it, it made me angry, not D, not Destin, not just the fact that",

What you're taught in J-school is that when a dog is run over on Main Street, what's the name of the dog? Like you need to get all these facts out there. You're standing in for people to explain the situation. So if the Douglas County Sheriff says he's not going to name the shooter, that's super weird and short-sighted. And I get it, I get it. What's the point of not naming him? He's small, he's a small community reeling from this and he has friends and family members who have been directly affected and he doesn't give a flying **** about journalism and what the real story is.
