Um, cuz I was kind of playing it just cuz I was like, I, I want to get through this and whatever. We did the let's play of it, but the let's play was kind of just the early on tutorial stage. After that, the game opens up a lot more. Um, um, it's, it's definitely not open world, but it's like you can kind of explore the city a little bit and like you can go back to the arc and switch characters whenever you want. So you can play through the game as whatever character you want, whereas the tutorial bit we did was to introduce you to each of the the different characters.

Yeah, and then throughout the game you get weapons and like there's a loot system that wasn't that great, but when you get it all you can kind of make all the characters a little too similar, I think. So it's like they start out very different, but then once you you give certain characters different weapons, they do start to do the same animations the other ones do and I was like that's kind of, I don't know, weak. Yeah, it reminds me of like Final Fantasy 10 where after you play for a while, it's like if you fill out the sphere grid there, everyone's just the **** same, right?

Like this is in a Tony Hawk situation where I'm like I'm excited for this thing, know it's licensed, whatever. It's definitely not the best Transformers game. Like I I think that War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron are both better than this. Oh wow, okay. Um, but I think that was Spark Unlimited that did though. No, it was the it the High Moon, the guys who did born those games. Those are good. Those are solid. think like yeah, those were revered. The first one, the second one was I think a shakier, wasn't it reception or was it the third one there was one that they fell off. The third was horrible fell off.

The third wasn't High Moon, I don't think and uh it was maybe I don't know the third was a movie tie-in. Gotcha, gotta got. They mixed the movie Universe with that Universe. It was like it was bad, but one and two were great. I think two people like two better than one. I I just remember they fell off at one point. Yeah, um, but this it's different. This to me is what everyone remembers, carto G1. This is G1 completely and it's they really kind of went out of their way to um give the the fans what they would want from all the original voices of the living cast. Um, and it's set up like an episode of the old cartoon where when there's scene transitions it does the little like Autobot to Decepticon that like that whole thing. I'm like that's **** awesome. Yeah, and the story is horrible in the best way. Yeah, it's like what's the story? Oh, Megatron's going to turn Earth into another Cybertron. It's",

It's like all right, this is a classic three-part story line of the episodes, you know, and you go and you kind of uh it starts off with just a bunch of like drone villains that you just beat and the Drone villains just keep coming back slightly stronger as different variants, but it always felt like it made sense within the world. Like once you start you fight Devastator and then you fight the Constructor cons and stuff and eventually the Star Scream and Sound Wave whatever. It does have a really nice sense of getting through it and you always know what's coming next. If you know Transformers, it's like pretty predictable, but it's like that's fun, you know, like the not spoiling anything the final boss fight is **** awesome and it's like this is the whole fighting system is what I remember Transformers",

It's super like the stories are horrible, the writing is horrible, the animation is like God awful, the colors of the characters just randomly shift and change for no reason. Um, and the the fight scenes aren't even fight scenes kind of like blast blast blast we missed every shot and like you know explosion you're done you're done son. This reminds me more of like taking the two toys and ramming them together and coming up with crazy stories in your head and like all this stuff.
