Now to celebrate the week of Halloween, we decided we're going to play a bunch of scary games, most of which we've never played for the first time. Play Slender. I've never played Slender, but I love all Hol Eve good good good good. So I'm excited about this, my favorite holiday. I played the original Slender, which was like more of like a tech demo type thing on the PC back in the day. Then they released this a couple years ago, which was more full fully featured game. Let's get right into it. Okay, now I and I imagine this is it is currently on easy difficulty. Yeah, all right, just going straight in. I like things that are easy. I imagine this is like kind of a biography for my life, just always trying to get skinnier and skinnier. Is that accurate, you think? Um, it's kind of like that, okay, except it's not um, it's just there's this Slender Man that like abducts children, nothing like my life up until this point, maybe unless you count Kevin kind of abducted him",

He's like a little child. Kevin is a child. He's a 5-year-old child. No, we're often Guided by our devotion devotion and our affection B that pulls us down paths not bargained bargained I guess bargained. We're getting cut off a little bit, Kev. We're getting cut off on the sides here. That's fine. I think we'll be okay. Is it zoomed in? There we go. Go L to run. So you got your handy dandy camcorder. Oh, I was like, I thought Kevin put that on by accident. I was going to yell at him, but can I jump over this thing? Maybe an X. You don't have a flashlight. Well, I don't need a flashlight right now. It's broad daylight. Let's go this way. SL. Well, I clearly can't get around this barrier, so the first have to go this way.

There was like eight notes put around on different trees and you had to find them. Okay, but there's the Slender Man out there and if he sees you, you're screwed. Oh man, I don't want any part of that guy. Can I stop recording or do I is it just record did I hit something that made it record? I think that it's it's the camcorder is allowing you to to do stuff without it you can't run. I don't have it keeps telling me I don't have a flashlight. Let's go up to this not at all imposing brick structure okay and see if there's someone that can help me find my away. I wonder who lives there? Probably the Slender Man. I don't know about that.

I want everyone to I'm trying to run, but this is the Run classic. Uhoh, uhoh, the short bus. No, that's a Jeep. Why is he getting all dark? I think I'm in shade. Things are looking real shady. This music's pretty imposing. It's definitely setting an atmospheric mood. I don't know. Let's just pretend it's not a scary game. You're just chilling. It's a walk in the park, man. Walk in the park. So am I doing what I'm supposed to be doing right now? Yeah, I think you're supposed to just keep walking down this path cuz I really wasn't given any sort of Direction.

Could it really just coincidence? I have to go to my doctor day for some routine stuff, so I'm going to try and casually bring this up and see what he says. Let you know how it goes. Yeah, doctors love it when you just casually bring up deep psychological issues that you're having get some paid.
