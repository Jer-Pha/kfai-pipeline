Tim, today we're going to play Super Meat Boy on uh Playstation 4, also available on Playstation Vita recently. It was on Xbox 360 and PC long ago years ago, but since this has come out since we started Kinda Funny, we thought we would play it here on the PS4. Yeah, last night I went in with the PS+ got it on my Vita. It's so I played on I've been playing it on Vita too. I think it's a little small. Meat Boy's a little small for I play it. I downloaded it. I didn't get into it yet cuz I knew we were doing this let's playday. I wanted my Meat Boy virginity sure to to be got to have me boy virginity.

Wait a minute, all right so so it's basically telling you to use the analog stick or you should use the d-pad to move. Square will let you go quicker just like in Mario. Oh got it okay and then you can use triangle to replay the level or you can press square to circle the map whatever and then R1 is the same as Square then yes okay cool so this is basically just teaching you the mechanics wall jumps going on very ninja guide like wall jumps why do I keep doing that cuz you're pressing after you beat the next stage don't press anything else I beat the stage when I",
