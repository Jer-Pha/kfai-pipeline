How did you do that? How did you manage? Because I knew we were going to I knew we were going to do this conversation. I knew we were going to do our reacts and I wanted it to be fresh. And oh my God, I didn't think it was possible for me to like something this much. It's not cool at this point. Stop. Okay, just stop. Now here's what I like about this. It starts off normal. It starts off actually like normal movies. Star Wars movie at this point, we're just getting introduced to this brand new character. And then we get a touch the Lucasfilm Limited logo. Um, still still doesn't feel because of the music going into this. I mean, we're seeing the TIE Interceptor and this is what I love. Um, you get that the TIE Fighter, excuse me, Interceptor. Um, you were seeing touches of Star Wars, but this looks like a normal sci-fi film. Uh, nothing will stand. This is where",

He's got that the we'll go back in a second and look at the stuff, but I just want to I want to talk briefly about this music cue. Mhm, right there. It's beautiful. It's fun. Are you this is now the second time you've ever even seen this, so you're still on the high of of how amazing this trailer is. I've seen this trailer maybe 100 times, probably literally. We're going to go through and I'm going to tell you all the things that you missed in this this wondrous trailer, all the homages, stuff. So so here we we start off with with Rey.

Um, so what she's in right now is that crashed the crashed Star Destroyer. Star Destroyer that we've seen. See that that looks like one of the areas. Yeah, Hangar Bay. So this is not to realized BB-8 was that big big. He is. I thought it was like a little dude. No, he's a big ass Droid. So it's the planet Jakku, which is not Tatooine like everyone thought in the the first couple trailers. Get off your ass. Um, you can see she's just kind of like a normal looking scavenger girl. Mhm, nothing special, kind of reminiscent of a little farm boy you might know. No, we're seeing it. We're seeing a lot. So we're seeing a lot of like, let's go back here, Nazis stuff going on.

You have to assume that guy is he looks yeah, he looks a little reminiscent of Grand Moff Tarkin. He not General Tarkin. Yes, and I think that's who he's going to be. He's going to be the new Tarkin of the the First Order, all that stuff. Look at this guy. Look at the guy right in front though. Love that he's got that cool story like he's the he's the elite Trooper or like the Snowtrooper right there. He's a Pyro. Oh, he's a Pyro. There's a couple guys here. You can actually see. Hold on, where is it? Like, look at that guy's got some sort of strap right there. Oh, that's dope. It's like flamethrower stuff. That's so we see that also in in some of the clips that",

That's so we see that also in in some of the clips that there's a couple guys. Yeah, there's a guy over to his right that has a flamethrower. That's pretty cool. We've been hearing a voiceover and it's like, who are you? It's like, I'm no one. And that's uh Lupita Nyong'o's character, who's this little Alien named Maz Kanata. Okay, we don't know too much about that, but she's a little space pirate got going around doing some stuff. Love space pirates. Yes, I was raised to do. Um, so here here this is really interesting. We start to see John Boyega's character kind of like question things and it goes from Daisy Ridley's character. It's like, who are you? I'm no one. And then he's just like essentially saying, I don't know like what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea who I'm fighting for anymore.

I've lost the sort of the cause, the general direction of what we were doing. I don't know what's going on with that. So while the other other trailers have been very kind of just like given us little bits and things that we couldn't really piece together story, going off the poster and this trailer, I have like a pretty good idea of what I think the plot of this movie is and where everything kind of falls into it. And um, I I definitely think that like this is a perfect example right here. There's blood on the Stormtrooper's helmet. It looks like fingers were yeah, scraping across his helmet. Look like a hand. I'm assuming that like he just dealt with death firsthand and it's just like, oh yeah, no, he's been he's definitely been through some **** right here. Like that's that's not the look of a man who just got off a vacation Boca Raton. That guy just had a he had a",

That guy just had a he had a firefight with someone and we're seeing that directly sort of juxtaposed with this uh TIE Fighter that has if you go back, it looks like see it looks like a different shape TIE Fighter slightly. Like the actual cockpit looks a little different, but they've got that sort of red stripe of the the First Order. And so we're we're definitely and so this is what I love about Star Wars. They've done such a great job, especially with this one of like saying, let's take the tack of before and kind of bring it up a little bit, throw a little modernized flare on it and go this is the crazy one of the crazy things. I want to point this out that even the the wardrobes have changed a little bit, right? Before we used to have, you know, we'd see Luke, but he had boots on and he had very much sort of a futuristic garb. Now we're",

Now we're getting a slightly more modern costume, which is a little reminiscent of another space series that we know that J.J. Abrams directed as well. Definitely what I think is interesting about this though, we're seeing his touches kind him him here right now in the all black garb. I think that's just his Stormtrooper outfit underneath the what they were under. And I think that that jacket is something that he just found. Oh, he probably found or stole it. Clearly he's clearly crashed or he's clearly we have the remember from the first trailer where he kind of wakes up and he's like in the middle. So I think that he's in that TIE Fighter as it crashes down. Oh, that's a possibility. That's interesting. Um, and I don't know if maybe that shot. I don't know if he would have been in that though, because he used a",

I don't know if he would have been in that though, because he used a traditional Stormtrooper gear. The TIE Fighter, the TIE Pilots wore different gear. Here's my thoughts, Nick. Here he is. He's realizing he messed up. He gets in one, steal, jacks it. Oh, you think he jacks it? I think he jacks the TIE Fighter and then gets blasted. That's bold. That's a bold that's a bold statement. Yeah, and crashes down. And then you can't just learn how to fly, John. What do you do? You can't just hop in a TIE Fighter and go toward Jakku. Okay, so you can see him overlooking this area. We assume that's a town that where the the main characters, what is her what is that character Rey? That that's where we think Rey is probably living. Now this, come on. All right, so going off of the idea, I mean, obviously this is this we're assuming this is Kylo Ren from behind, right? Well, because we're about to see",

Well, because we're about to see this is Kylo Ren for sure. Well, we're assuming we haven't seen him and from the front without the hood specifically, right? So we know the shape of this helmet is very very Darth Vader. We see him. We hear that voiceover of him uh uh basically praying to the Cult of Vader saying, I'm going to finish what you started. But I don't know. I mean, it's crazy because we we're seeing those even him. We're going to see a later shot with him and his homies where he's got that little crew of people together that all have the oddly like the dark black armor. See, you'll see. So so what's happening here, Nick, as you can see in the poster of this movie, there's a new Death Star like um oh, you think he's on the going on? I think that this is uh like the control deck of that. And this blast right there, that's the modern green",

So we do see that. So now we're seeing the sort of the curvature of his helmet there. And we can see that he is he has adopted the look of of his his savior Vader. That's such a cool thing. Obviously the helmet from so here we go. This is a beautiful homage to A New Hope. Yeah, so he's torturing him. And then we see a planet hitting. So this character right here is Poe Dameron. Is that Oscar Isaac? Yes, Oscar Isaac. He is essentially the cool pilot guy. Like I'm assuming his personality will be. Yeah, okay. Yeah, we've seen other clips of him being uh captured. Okay, cool. Um, so and he doesn't have his jacket. So I'm assuming that the the other dude has took his jacket. That's a",

I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but I think what we do so this planet being blown up, I'm going to guess that it's his home world maybe. And I'm going to guess I'm sequence. I'm going to guess it's the just it up potentially. But I mean, we see shots of that world later. We think I don't I don't I think it's a different place maybe. Let's let's play it because it looks like when they trade off when they have the sort of bro moment underneath the wings, we were about to see uh For the First Time Princess Leia. Um, it looks like it's a woodland like planet, like an Endor planet. Yes, I mean, it might be this. Maybe they're defending that. We're going to see a battle there or maybe they just lose.

So I either way, I think that it's his home planet blowing up because that's exactly what happened in A New Hope when Vader was torturing Leia and then blows up Alderaan. That's that's that's hardcore. You're going deep down that that. All right, there are stories about. What do you hear that that music that you love? So that beautiful. It's the Love Theme between Han and uh Leia, which is awesome because it really kind of gives a lot of evidence to my theory that this girl is Han and Leia. Well, she's someone. She's definitely related. It's one of and I'm I'm almost positive she's not going to be Luke. She's Luke was basically a Jedi priest, so he wasn't allowed to put his pee anywhere.

And then he he goes on. He says, the Dark Side, the Jedi. It's all all real. And as he but as he says the Jedi, this is what's cool about it. Go ahead and press play. Yeah, but wait, real quick. This is just such another beautiful homage to A New Hope where Han Solo is just like, nah, there's no Force controlling me. Like the the Jedi, the Force is a made up thing. Yeah, not only that, but it's also this image is awesome because it it's reminiscent of of A New Hope where they're sitting there trying to plan, you know, you've got the solar system that has the Death Star on it and they're trying to figure out how to kill it.

Yeah, I'm getting I'm getting my Star Wars character is sitting there and having that that sort of like, yeah, this is what it is. So we're seeing this. What's that? She's in Jedi. I don't know if she's in A New Hope. Is she in Jedi? Whatever the rabbit hole. Anyway, long long story short is I love that look. I love that they're sitting there playing strategically over that that solar system. Is Star Wars. That's amazing. BB-8 going too. Is what in it? What what's not in this trailer? Not yet at least. Um, so we see the first time space and then the Force theme kicks in, AKA Luke's theme. So look at these. These are the guys you do not want to meet on a dark and stormy night. So the these are the Knights of Ren. So he's Kylo Ren. We don't know too much about this, but we know that",

Now what's cool here, Nick, you were saying that they all have Darth Vader-esque helmet. That's kind of true. They all do kind of look like that except this **** over here. Who does he look like? Cause that's some **** Mandalorian armor if I've ever seen it. Oh, that's pretty fascinating. Now go back to the shot before the wider shot. Keep going, keep going. There it is. That's interesting. Yeah, this is probably the best shot we got uh with brightness and stuff. But like that **** looks like Boba Fett straight up. I'll give you a little bit of Boba Fett. I mean, it's it's a lot.

There's now a couple books, comic books, The Clone Wars show, Rebels show, and then the movies. And that's it. There's a book that came out called Aftermath. It's the first official Canon book in this in the new the new Canon. Okay. And in it, there's a reference to Boba Fett's armor. And it's not directly called Boba Fett's armor, but uh a bunch of Jawas have some armor. Some dude looks at he's like, man, Mandalorian armor. Like they sure made that **** resilient. And they describe it as if it's looks like it's been through hell and it's just had a battle with acid. Interesting. AKA Sarlacc acid. Yeah. Okay. So the idea is that's probably not Boba Fett, but it probably is some badass in Boba Fett's armor. That's potential. I mean, thing too is you have to me throwing some of",

We love Boba Fett and obviously we want to see him come back to life as soon as possible. So that'd be **** cool. This is also the most badass version of this theme. Oh my God, are you kidding me? So this is that plan that it looks this looks similar to that. It might be a different plan actually. Those look like different trees. Yeah, there's trees and stuff. I'm I'm not really sure. This is obviously big ass battle they're having. This is the this shot, quick shot of them. This shot is amazing because it's another homage to when Luke's getting ready for the Battle of Yavin.

And as he says Jedi, we see Dark Side, the dark and the Jedi, right? And so he does say Dark Side on Poe as well. I don't think that they're going to go that route, but just saying, I think that'd be amazing if he got turned to the Dark Side. But my whole theory is that this this guy is the fake Jedi. He's not really a Jedi. I think he's a Jedi. He's not no Jedi. And you I I'm almost I'm essentially positive he ain't no Jedi. The girl's a Jedi and they're both Jedi. You don't know. I hope not.

I'm assuming this is like two the movie. And we got a of flags up there kind of representing like I was talking to Kevin about this and he pointed out some really cool things. We think that this is like originally Kevin thought that this was the The Throne Room from the end of uh A New Hope, like the the ceremony. Oh, it's not though. We looked it up and it's interesting though. Could be in the same. It's not, but it could be. The architecture looks very similar, which leads me to believe that this is Yavin.

So maybe it was something some sort of blast cut it. I'm going to assume that if you know the Death Star, that ain't no moon. I think that the new Death Star's thing is actually being disguised in the planet. Interesting. I think they built it into the planet. That's pretty fascinating. And so that's why that like that shot of him shooting the big red thing. I think that's from this planet. Oh, interesting. That'd be cool. Oh yeah, look at that. Let's pause. I mean, I don't know. This could just be a base that's built in that looks like spe. This is wild speculation. But look, see, we're seeing that up in the upper right hand corner. That's that's that might be there. He was in some sort uh yeah, there's oh man, there's going to be a lot. I'll tell you one thing right now. The X-Wing squadrons get a lot of action this movie. This is going to be **** awesome.

She looks she looks pissed here. She has some sort happy. See, that's why I think that's why I think she's going to be more of the Han Solo character because we're we're seeing her with with like the heavy blasters, the shooting from the hip, sort of the more like you pull yourself yourself up by your bootstraps kind of character. And Boyega looks a little bit a little bit more like the the Luke Skywalker character. We'll see. I'm telling you that's because she's his daughter. She might be his daughter. So she has the Blaster things. But then no, like the whole the the all the voiceover that you listening to. I'm telling you. Well, clearly she has something. I mean, even if she was his",
