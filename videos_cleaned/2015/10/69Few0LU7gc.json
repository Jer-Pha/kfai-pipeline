I do think people give you I see it all the time people do give you a lot of **** on Twitter for various things and I think it's good and I think you should be out there but part of the reason why you are so popular is because you do represent a very pointed um perspective much more so than myself.

Yeah, I think that I I respect and appreciate that fear. I had to let it go and I did. I let it go a long time ago and I I used to be much more of a flamethrower than I am now but there is there is something to to be balanced and look at things both sides and I just try to approach things not from a party lens.

That's how I came to the gay marriage conclusion. That's how I came to the pro-choice conclusion. I used to be pro- lifee, you know, that was one thing that I was I was pro lifee not too long ago like you know five years ago and I looked at and I was like this isn't consistent with Republican values really because what's consistent with Republican values is to say do what you want to your own body. Now there must be limitations. We've talked about this on conversation with Colin. I don't think there should be abortions probably after 14 weeks or so but I think that you have to give women a way out. It's their body the the baby cannot survive without the women.
