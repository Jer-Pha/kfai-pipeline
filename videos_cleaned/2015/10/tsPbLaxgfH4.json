I'm one of your hosts Greg Miller alongside the producer/seducer with his haircut and his shorts Nick Scarpino. Oh my god Greg. It's so hot outside right now. It is. I I don't like it. This is not why we moved to San Francisco. It's supposed to be fall all the time here. It's ridiculous. We're supposed to have built-in air condition in the way of it's always freezing. And now I've been I've been wearing shorts three consecutive days in a row. That is a record for me. That's no good.

So I'm going to go a little bit more serious than I normally do because usually I have really really stupid topics. But today uh I want to talk about something that it's a little darker. Yesterday was the third anniversary of my dad's death. And I didn't realize that until my mom called me. We're just c catching up talking about stuff. And then like she brought it up. She was talking about how like my little cousin got married and all this other stuff like all this good stuff. And then she like like ended it with like \"Oh yeah it was it was you know it's been 3 years.\" And I was like \"Holy shit.\" And I like you know talked to her for a bit and hung up the phone and I was just like \"Man like I can't believe that",

And it then made me I I went down this really deep rabbit hole of just like \"All right what have the biggest hurdles I've had to kind of jump over in my life?\" And I look back and a lot of them are death based and losing stuff. Then there's you know the the breakups and the the the heartbreaks like that. But it's like it's just interesting to me that like I don't think I've ever had to overcome a challenge that I was in control of that like I felt like I couldn't do anything about you know and I was just wondering if you guys had anything that you feel like there was this challenge put in front of you that you could overcome the",

Like it's the challenge is talking to my mom on the phone and having her bring it up and hearing her tear up and stuff. Or the challenge was like the first time I saw Kevin after that happened and I remember having to be there for him and being like \"Dude like we got each other.\" Like and that is the ongoing challenge of it you know?

And I think that's just because of how close we are and like I don't know just sort of feeling like you like someone else is hurting in your life and you can't really do anything about it. It's that feeling of like helplessness and that's a it's it's hard because that's life right? The challenges that you can easily overcome.
