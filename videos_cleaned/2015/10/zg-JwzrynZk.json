Don't ruin now. We're supposed to see it. Feel free to. Together, we're going this weekend. We've made a mandate. My wife understood this. Having said that, my wife did not care, and she was like, she understood. I woke up at 9:00 on Sunday, which is a little bit later for me. Normally, I get the sort of like, cabinets are rumbling, dishes are starting. She's been up since 7:30, and uh, she was in the shower, which was nice, nice thing to wake up to. And I walk in doing my normal thing, which is the snake. Have I told you about the snake? No. Sometimes I go, I do the snake where it kind of comes in and then just randomly grabs **** off our shower caddy and drops it. She does not like it, but I think it's growing on her. So I got to do that, and she's like, are you like making like the any noises or no? It's a silent, it's just silent snake. Just comes in it",

Really similar to your your Cobra thing. It's a Python. Please, please, you're scaring Greg. Stop scaring. So yeah, my wife basically was like, look, I really want to see this movie today. I'm she's out of town next week with her her mother-in-law. No, no, no, this is after you drop something. This is how the conversation started. Yeah, yeah, this this what I do. Like, where was the segue from the snake? Well, no, I was I I want to see this. I went in to do the snake. She like, I want to see The Martian. I went in to do the snake, and about three like, uh, just like a foot inside the bathroom, I was like, I know you're in here, and I want to see The Martian. We're going at 11:30.

I was like, okay, marriage sounds awesome. Well, she was, you know, it was it was just the thing is with my wife, when she's super fired up to see a movie, I always want to encourage. She actually wants to go to the theater, and I love I still love the experience going to the theater. Um, even though I this that this was a good experience. We we always go to the we either go to the, well, I guess it's the same showing, the kids and old person showing in the morning where it's like before noon.

And you hear just from the back of the theater, what did he say? Yeah, I know. What what's he doing on the screen? I can't I can't see the screen. That's funny. Kids are like that too. The kids and what's what's happening? Hold. Why? Who's that? Who's that? It's like, it's the the main character. They've been here the whole **** time. Yeah, I saw Inside Out with a bunch of kids.

I forget how good he is. He last time I last thing I remember seeing him in was he was uh, well, I don't know if I want to spoil that film, but he he shows up as small character. You're thinking of the same one. I think you're allowed to spoil that one now. I don't think you are. Really? Yeah, all right. I still think that's a little fresh. But recently, um, what movie are you talking about? You would know. Okay, I know what you're talking about. Okay. But he just he's been random side characters and things.

I do jump to all the things where I'm thinking of him being a sidekick or a side character. Is Bourne the only like thing where he's out front? Well, he carrying the picture. Yeah, the first movie I remember seeing him in was School Ties, where that was when Brendan Fraser was huge, and he was the he was like the prick, the **** kid that like ratted out of someone. That's not like front-facing dude. But yeah, I'm sorry. No, but so that that was him as a side character. And then of course, he did Good Will Hunting, which is kind of kind of blew him up, started doing the Bourne movies.

Yeah, but then you see him in The Martian, and you're like, oh, I forgot this guy is a mega star. Yeah, and that that that but it's so fascinating to do that. You I don't think of him like that. Yeah, you know what I mean? Not that I think I think of him as a failure or anything, but yeah, I don't think of him as the I'm in front carrying the picture movie star guy, because I think of Ocean's Eleven. I mean, dialing it way back for me, I think of this is **** weird now, because like he is he is a movie star, and so is Ben Affleck. But growing up, right? And Kevin will be right there with me on this. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were your boys that you **** knew and understood because of Kevin Smith, because Chasing Amy, because of well, no, I mean, I'm",

And then yeah, Chasing Amy, they're both Chasing Amy though, aren't they? Exactly. And Chasing Amy, it's Brian O'Halloran and across the thing being the guy trying to buy the comic book, and next to him is Matt Damon, who's super young and hasn't done anything probably other than School Ties or whatever. I think he did it well. Yeah, I that was like right after then then that's when him and Ben started Good Will Hunting behind the scenes or whatever. As they get they win their Oscar for that, they're filming Dogma. You know what I mean? Like this is like, you know, being part of the Kevin Smith Community back then, the View Askewniverse and",

So to see get I remember when Ben Affleck started dating J.Lo, and I was like, are you **** kidding me? You know what I mean? Ben Affleck is dating J.Lo. Batman. Yeah, I know, right? And it just like the scales were all **** up in terms of like this like you as a kid and probably somebody growing up. I didn't first off, I don't think this is, you know, the dawn of the age of feel like you actually know a celebrity, right? Based on there's commentary tracks and interviews and this behind the scenes stuff. Like, well, no, this I'm talking about when I was in high school talking about that. Okay, with them, right?

But that's impressive, and that speaks I think volumes to to a his just him in general as a human being and to his character is that he has had that long career, and how many people ask him to do that, right? Ben Affleck, I don't think, um, well, I guess he's I guess he's had you would say a better career than Matt Damon in some regard, because I think he's he's done slightly more high-profile films. But like you're talking about a career that spans 30 years almost at this point, right? Like Dazed and Confused for Ben Affleck early '90s coming up on that. So it's just fascinating. I mean, that these are just people that I admire. Like I admire Matt Damon. I admire the fact that he's been able to hold it together. Admire that he's still, you know, I think I looked up his uh, his filmography before he came in here, and I forgot that",

Fantastic movie, fantastic movie. But he's just a random like, he's the random other guy. And you're like, that's **** Matt Damon. Like, it's **** Matt Damon. Which that just reminded me saying that my favorite thing Matt Damon was ever a part of was the Jimmy Kimmel War, where Jimmy Kimmel I don't remember the exact order of this, but Jimmy Kimmel put out a video. No, Jimmy Kimmel was with Sarah Silverman, right? Yeah, they split up. Yeah, but then he had her on his show and doing this whole fake thing, and then she put out this music video called um, I'm **** Matt Damon. Yeah, do you guys remember this?

Yeah, pretty best thing he's ever done. Best thing he's ever done. He's got a sense of humor about himself. Yeah, definitely. Wasn't also and I I'm struggling to remember which movie it was, but wasn't he the guy who was saying Scotty Doesn't Know in the one movie EuroTrip? Like two scenes in EuroTrip. Guy doesn't know. I mean, by far the biggest celebrity in that movie. Oh, sure. No one else in that movie did anything else notably that I can think of. What's that? Yeah, but what what do Michelle Trachtenberg say?

And what and so another example, well, what I was going to say about that, and I don't know how you guys feel about it. Saving Private Ryan to me is very easily one of the great movies of all time. Yeah, so like I'm I'm fascinated with anyone's association with that. The only more fascinating person in that movie's association was is who? Guess. Can you guys guess who's in that movie that I can't believe you're not saying his name right now? Would Vin Diesel. Yeah, yeah, like so awesome. So like Caparzo. I Tom Sizemore. Like myc.

This is the way it should be, because this is the way it was. Um, but I love looking at movies like that, and I'm like, it's just fascinating looking at the roster of people that were in movie.

That's that's what I appreciate about him is that he does these roles that don't always paint him as the the superstar in the superstar life, right? Whereas like a guy like Vin Diesel, and this is not knocking Vin Diesel, um, he always has to be the superhero, right?

And that's just another movie where he's associated happens to be associated with a permutation of people, a more talented cast, I would say, than Saving Private Ryan.

They're actually genetically altering them to be like faster and stronger and smarter. And Jeremy Renner is one of those characters, and he just he plays a really good character. It's cool.
