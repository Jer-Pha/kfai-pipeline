We've been waiting for this one for a long time. It's a PlayStation 4 exclusive. It's called Everybody's Gone to the Rapture by the Chinese Room. It sounds like, I won't lie, it sounds like a cool album. It does sound like a cool Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and then the band is the Chinese Room. Like that's I think it just heads up if you guys want to start making games every that's a great way. Do we finally have it though finally getting to play it now here's a little here's a little rumor for you, Colin. Okay, hit me with it. I've never played ever we've gone to events I've watched over people's shoulders and I've been like I like everything this game's doing I don't want to play it. I've not played it either you're driving today right um and uh driving's fancy game industry term for playing the game I was like I'm not driving a car, Colin.",
