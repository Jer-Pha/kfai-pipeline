            "text": "greetings and salutations welcome back to Kinda Funny Games. My name is Colin, this is Tim. Tim, today we're playing uh an N64 game on Rare Replay uh via Xbox One. Of course, Rare Replay just came out on Xbox One, 30 games, $30, very cool uh collection. We've already done a few videos celebrating some of the earlier games. We went to the N64 era and didn't really know which direction to go in. Uh we could have gone a Jet Force Gemini, we obviously can't do7 or or Donkey Kong or any of those kinds of things, but we did land on Banjo-Kazooie. Now, it's Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, of course, came from Rare during the N64 era. This is the Xbox 360 port of Banjo-Kazooie, so it is a little prettier and it's in widescreen and all that. It's a lot prettier, Colin, tell you that much. So here's the thing, I've never played Banjo-Kazooie. I said this a long time ago on an episode of Gamescast when we were talking about Yooka-Laylee that this is one of the games that I missed out on because my I would have loved it. I loved 3D platformers, I",

I loved 3D platformers, I still do, but uh my parents just didn't buy me buy it for me. So I remember I rented it from Blockbuster once, but that wasn't really enough time for me to get into it and like beat it, but it was enough time for me to to realize that was very much a collectathon and that I did not enjoy that as much as some of the other games out there. And Rare obviously pretty well known during this era for having collectathon kind of games, although that's not unique to them. I mean, I feel like everyone was trying to fill these new 3D worlds they were making with something like these worlds were very vacant and N64 had its moments of collecting, sure. I hold it against it, but no no, but it's just I think it's just a design aesthetic of the time. It's it's the way these games were designed. It's like, you know, did",

Like what, you know, what is this, what does this place exist for if not to get that bolt? Yeah, you know, um so why can't he grab on to things? It's annoying. Yeah, that's weird. Um so yeah, this game came out in 1998 on N64. Obviously, this was this came out about four years before uh Rare was purchased by Microsoft outright. So this is one of their last independent games. Um and uh it's well loved. Uh got a got a, you know, got a sequel in Banjo-Tooie, also that Nuts & Bolts game, although I don't really know anything about that game. Yeah, I don't either.

Can you backflip and then use the glide from from the the apex of the back back? No no. Oh, okay. I'll come back to that later. I'm supposed to go to the top of the mountain so this little dude will help us. The guy looks like Patillo. Yeah, yeah. All right, he's he he really does Patillo, just as dumb. So what's cool, you were saying that it's upsetting that he doesn't grab the the things, which is a more modern game mechanic. What I like a lot about this is that this is the Xbox 360 version, so obviously it's prettier, but also you can use the the right stick to control the camera, be a camera, and it actually like works.

And we took for there you go, we took for granted some of the uh some of the cool things that the N64 controller could do, although I still think it's one of the most unusual and unorthodox and probably annoying controllers ever made. Um water looks pretty good. There's a lot of like interesting design choices in this game. Obviously, the sky is kind of just it is what it is, not not a lot going up there, but they they have both they have both structural depth in terms of the geography of the game as well as um textural that, which I think is pretty cool to make the the world look lived in.

Feel like it probably did. Yeah, cuz I know that uh Donkey Kong 64 did and I think vure did one, didn't I? I honestly feel like with a Rare exception, by the time you got pretty mid and late in the N64 era, oh, with Rare exception, uh unintentional pun, uh I feel like a lot of the most important games did require uh after a while that extra that extra because I feel like there wasn't too many that even supported it, cuz I know Perfect Dark, uh Majora's Mask required it, Donkey Kong required it.

So the one cool thing about I think about this game, not that it was it was on par with some of the other games that were trying to do similar things, was that it wasn't the game had a kitty aesthetic, but I still feel like it was a game kind of for everybody. Um but that was kind of the N64's thing was that was there was a lot of, you know, things for kids that I think were kind of deeper than you you let on than were let on.

Oh, so you're going to enter this this this lair here. Got to fight me some Gruntilda. And I feel like we can learn a lot from older games because they didn't have a lot of space to for exposition and to tell stories, but the games just get out of their own way and just let you play. Yeah, which I think is nice. And then gives you little pieces of story, so it's not just like story story story story story then you get to play.

If it did, she'd be fine. Not enough verticality. Uh oh, I like the voice like the cop out voice acting from this era too, where like I was always found that a little annoying. It was even worse on the SNES. I love that Nintendo still just does it. It's painting here. Is that like a Mario 64 throw? Yeah, I was going to say, all right, what's going on up here?

It is weird playing with the like a modern controller, cuz like the analog feels just a little bit off. Yeah, it's always interesting to go back and play games with with with uh hardware that wasn't really meant to play it in the first place, but for a lot of people this is the first way they ever were introduced to this game. Mhm. 10 of us on each world will help you for so many things to find. Why who's putting all this **** everywhere? Yeah, see, I remember this is where it lost me. Get Jiggy.
