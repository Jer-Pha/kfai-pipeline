It wasn't working for us very well. We just played Battletoads for 30 minutes. You know last couple days we've been playing all these rare games. We did the the pre NES era then we did the NES era except for Battletoads and we're like we got to get on this. So we know Battletoads has the the very infamous speeder bike tunnel challenge whatever the hell it's called. I'm not even really sure. But in Rare Replay this game's here in its full glory but there's a snapshot of it where we just get to play the hard level. Yeah. And this is this snapshot. So we're playing Yeah. We're playing Rare Replay 30 games $30 on Xbox One and each game has their own snapshots which just kind of thrusts you into more notorious or famous parts of each game so you can play them as they are. Obviously Battletoads is",

Obviously Battletoads is known as being one of the hardest if not the single hardest NES game in existence. And one of the really terrible parts of the game is the Turbo Tunnel. Yes. Um so this is Turbo Tunnel Infinite and it's something we tried to do before but the green screen freaked out. So we're going to do it again. So what it is it's a challenge to see if you can get through 45 seconds uh of this ridiculous thing. Right. So we did it. And what we're going to do is I'll do three turns then he'll do three turns. We'll do three rounds of that to see if one of us can do it. And yeah so the last one we got pretty close but not no cigar. So we'll see if we can do it this time. Uh we both got around 39 seconds but then Colin at one point got 43 seconds. Yeah it was very We died because the end of it",

Yeah it was very We died because the end of it is pretty challenging. There's this big jump. Something I want to let people know out there is that the uh the reason we have to redo this video cuz the first one was a classic. It was they'll never see it. They'll never see it. But we had to redo it because uh the green screen that we're using to get rid of this stuff also green screened out the game which as you can imagine is a problem. Problem Battletoads. Yeah. Yeah. So everyone like everything that was like hues of green was all hues of like gray and black basically. There's a lot of green in this game. All right. So this is pretty early on in Battletoads and is like a really difficult part. Like a lot of people just got straight up stuck at this part and rightfully so.

You should have seen this when we first started playing cuz we weren't we weren't getting I still get scared by that thing. Yeah it's it is scary. I mean there's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with being scared. Oh god. And if someone does it should we call it? Should we call it? See? Yeah. This is This is tough. That was **** What am I supposed to do there? I I don't know. I don't have an answer for you unfortunately.

As you can see the top of it has the uh you know the circumcised Oh damn it. I'm you know talking about dicks so much. It's hard to focus. It's distracting. It's all about dicks. Um and there's the veins going up too. At least they're detailed. I like that. I don't like it when people draw dicks and like have dicks and they're just like you know not really emotional. No emotional dick. Yeah I want I want to see the emotion in the dick. I don't blame you. I love seeing emotions in dicks as as well. So let's see. All right. So so far so good.

That's the reason I'm I'm going to take one more just because uh I **** up talking about the dicks. Oh jeez you're cheating already. Okay. Yeah I'm take one more cuz I **** up talking about the dicks. It happens you know. Well I'm not Yeah I mean it is what it is. There's nothing I can do about it. Mhm. It's time to focus.

I don't remember what game that was but it was probably colorful. Too many colors in these games. All right Microsoft Studios. I know. All right we're going back in. Someone on Twitter uh was getting on me about the fact he was like Tim like you need to understand the importance of history and like you're when you say all these things and you were talking **** about all the old Rare games being too colorful like you're you need to understand what you're doing to kids these days. And I was like what? First off I love retro games. Second off just because something's old doesn't make it good. Yeah. And then I I responded with",

I'm like \"There's no difference between black and white and green and white. If it's just one bright color it's not like this is great.\" All right. Have you been using the uh the D-pad or the analog? Yeah me too. The Xbox One's D-pad is really quite superior to the Xbox 360 I got to say. Yeah they kind of nailed it. Not still not as good as like what what's going on on Wii. Oh I keep I keep forgetting A is not jump. See this will be your mistake one. You get three more. It's okay.

It's kind of a blessing and a curse to have something this annoying this early in the game. Oh is it early? This is early in the game really. And but at the same time it's like very discouraging to like try to like get anywhere. Yeah I said this in the last one but it's really not that difficult. It's frustrating and stuff but once you get it down it's kind of like I don't know. It's not that bad. It reminds me of the Minecraft or not Minecraft. Wow. The minecart levels in uh Donkey Kong Country which makes sense seeing as this is rare. Jesus. 40. That's exactly the high I high score from the last one was 4301. God.

These penises are all coming at me. God it's like my nightmares. Nick's dreams. This is Nick's dream. This is my dream too. Just being bombarded with penises. Yeah it's big pink sticks of thunder. Sticks of thunder indeed. All right juking left and right. I like that. Look at that face. Only mother could love that. Oh got too zealous there. Yeah I do feel like there's there's some shoddy. Is that my last one? That's my last one. All right. Uh some shoddy hit detection here. So this is the second round of three that we're going to try here.

It's got to be I mean it is the shadow but like I feel like I'm still making like the trajectory of the jump should still get me to where I need to be. So I'm a little confused by that. So we were talking about in the last video that no one will ever see. Certainly Battletoads has to be a reflection of the Ninja Turtles right? Like a way to do the turtles but not paying for that license. Portillo was barking so I think he agrees. Oh too much velocity there again. Too much velocity. For every time I heard that.

All right. One more. This is This is turn number six for you. Um technically seven. Well whatever. It really doesn't matter. Um yeah. I don't know. So Battletoads. Mhm. NES game 91. one of Rare's last NES games. Uh well remembered although I think I think overrated and I think that frankly just well remembered because of how **** ridiculously hard it is. Rare made hard games. I mean they've always made hard games until really the N64 when I think they're a little more manageable. But um certainly an interesting game and a dynamic game.

So this is go number four for me. What was that? I don't know. This is becoming frustrating. I feel like this is going to ruin everyone's lives. They're trying to do it. It It doesn't It doesn't look as hard as as it is. I'll give you that. I had my hand on the A button again. Like I don't I don't quite understand. I got to get I got to the Jeez. **** Battletoads.

I mean it's actually pretty easy. All right. Jesus **** Christ. All right my last three. Ah Battletoads. Turbo Tunnel Infinite. It's breaking my balls.
