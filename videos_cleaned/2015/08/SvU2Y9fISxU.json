It's just a competition. I don't know. I don't know what the **** it is, but I think you're right in that these are just words. But it's the same like with gymnastics, right? If you look at that versus boxing, you I would say boxing is a sport. I would think, right? And both, they're both judged by three people and they're both at the end of the day, you get a score unless you knock the other person out. And with gymnastics, you can get knocked out.

Like and this and that's what I'm saying, it's like that's why we can't. I'd rather have a narrow view of what it is than a really wide view and then figure out a way to respectfully categorize everything else as as being equal and interesting because I think all this stuff is very interesting, but finding a name or a way to categorize it that treat it with respect. In other words, I'm sorry, in other words, I think this the word sport is put up on this pedestal and if it's not, if so, it's like, oh, darts aren't a sport, **** you, like, right?

You know, I'm really good at darts. Sport is the pinnacle of what any activity can be. It's an inferior activity unless you call it a sport and then it warrants me putting copious amounts of time into it. Exactly, just exactly. And to me, it's like, no, no, no, like sport isn't up here. Sport's down here next to right next to and parallel to pro gaming and parallel to these these these skill games like like billiards and all these kinds of things. Just that this particular vertical is where like you put your body on the line in some way. And I guess that's kind of like where I st I stand on that.

Sports are the the whatever's competitive. Like that's what makes it a sport. So it's like, yeah, darts is, so is games, so is this, so is **** dancing, so is **** uh cooking or whatever. It's like, who cares? Like why is sports a special word? Like, well, because the reason, and this is my argument, because this is the things people being like, why do you care?

We don't even have we have a word for that anymore, you know? It's like, and so if if anything can be a sport and it doesn't matter, then why have a category for it at all? And why even have the word sport, you know? Like that's kind of where I'm coming from. It's the same thing with exclusives where it's like, this is an exclusive on this console except for it's also on PC, except for you can also play on your not exclusive then, is it?

Well, that's the but but remember, ESPN is entertainment and sports. So it's it's not that channel is not just made for for sports. That's why they've had the the Spelling Bee forever. That's why they show poker, you know, and all these kinds of things. So you have to understand that it's not ESPN is not just sports program. It's supposed to be something that's entertaining. That's why they show Esports too, because they're smart enough to know that this is going to make them a lot of money in the future.

It's one of those things where the I think the last year was the first time it really dawned on me that a, there is a National Spelling Bee. It's not just something that people use as a trope in movies to make you laugh and to make fun of nerds. B, you can't spell dawn. I I can't spell anything. You've seen my motion graphics up. And B, Colin watches the Spelling Bee every year and knows the people that are in it. Yeah, knows that like profiles them.

Uh, well, I'm a school teacher, but my claim to fame is that I read the words on the National Spelling Bee on ESPN. Like awesome. Spelling Bee is fun. Spelling Bee is good drama. And that's the other thing that people have kind of I think mixed up sports and drama in terms of like, well, the the the line on the graph is is sports and drama go up. This is why the NFL is so successful because the NFL there's few games. There only 16 games a year plus playoffs and every game matters and there's a week's worth of drama in between every games.

Uh, the point is is that the NFL has mastered the fusion of entertainment and sports and drama and sports in such a way that when someone sees like, well, I I was reading with Dota, like there's some shakeups post the $6 million winning where these Dota teams are getting broken up and this is the first time these that they're really dealt with this kind of thing where it's like people are getting dropped and released into the wild basically like happens in football every day.

I mean, an NFL is just awesome, but it doesn't necessarily mean that just because you have drama with an activity means that it's a sport either. So I guess that's what I'm saying, it's like these words just need to mean something. That's all. That's all I want is just words that otherwise, why the **** do we talk? That's true, isn't it?

Um, but it's got It's a little weird and a little telling that we we don't glorify more activities like the Spelling Bee kind of sucks. I wish there were more Spelling Bees. I wish there was stuff like I think there are, but nobody watches them. Nobody watches them. They just don't they don't get the ratings. They're on ESPN5. There's a five? I would not be surprised. I don't know. I don't watch ESPN. There's a lot. I mean, there's a lot of ESPN, ESPN Classic, ESPN News, ESPN One and Two. Classic's my favorite.
