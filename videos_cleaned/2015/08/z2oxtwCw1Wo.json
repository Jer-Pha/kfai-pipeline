Now Tim, clear it up, did you cry or did you not cry at the end of The Fast 7? To be completely honest, I did not cry. Tim, you, I was sitting next to you, you teared up. You did not sit. Did I watch that movie with you? Sure as hell did. We saw, remember Tyrese was there and he gave us, he gave us the like Fu right, the whole like what's up. Tyrese was there, he came out and we were like dope. And then actually that was kind of the highlight of the whole experience for me, truth be told. But the movie was good, movie was great. But come on, went to if I have Tyrese intro every movie that I watch like, yo what up dog, it's Tyrese, you watching Hunt for Red October Sean Connery. I in this one, it's cool, have fun. Yeah, that's Tyrese for you. You know Tyrese is trying to be Green Lantern. Yeah, do it. I don't know that. Why would, why wouldn't you be out with that? I because like Green Lantern has no place in the",

I because like Green Lantern has no place in the Fast and Furious universe. That's how I don't thinks. No, they're not trying to put the Green Lantern into the Fast and Furious. He can make his own car with his ring and just drive around. That's a really good point. That is a good point. Maybe he took all that money he had, you know, he spent on cars for a while. Now he's spending on getting technology to find aliens and then he finds the Guardians of Oa and they're like, what's this character's name in the in the in the F Roman Reigns of Earth? Not true. You've been shown to it's not Roman Reign. Roman Reigns is a professional wrestler. Roman, it's Roman Reigns is a professional wrestler. Roman Pierce. It's Roman, Roman Pierce of Roman Reigns. Roman Reigns, I'm WWE. You've shown great willpower. Yeah, but he can't, he can't see, here's the flaw in your logic.",

Yeah, but he can't, he can't see, here's the flaw in your logic there. The ring picks, yep, the person. He doesn't pick it. No, I know that. So even if he goes all the way out to Oa and like talks to little bald guys, yeah, he's going to be like, hey, I want a ring. They like, no dog. But you point like I was giving the voice of the ring. Is it found him? Oh, that was the ring. I thought it was the one of the, you know, the little uh Guardians. Guardians. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How do you know about Green Lantern? I saw the movie. Oh god. Well actually no, I've seen the movie which was okay. No, it was not okay, Nick. I'm being nice to it. But I really liked the animated show, the CG show they did. It was amazing. And of course, every single time I fall in love with a television show that's animated, it's immediately canceled. I love the X-Men, canceled. Young Justice, canceled. They only did what?

Young Justice, canceled. They only did what? Spectacular Spider-Man, canceled. Well, I mean, that's fine. That is they have to make some concessions because the show was terrible. I pointed this out in another thank you videos. You keep getting passed. You need to get over. Just commit to I'm driving 80 miles an hour. I know that. But I'm saying technically you're breaking. You could get a ticket for me here. Yeah, if people are passing you in the in the wrong lane. That's not true at all. That's not that is 100% how that works. I've been pulled over for that. They're going to get going against over. Not if I'm going 80 miles over the speed limit already. The only you're only supposed to use the left lane for passing and you're clearly just chilling in it **** talking a pizza. You think I'm looking at eight cars right now that are not passing anyone? Yeah, you think they're going",

Yeah, you think they're going to go, I got one and eight chance, I'm fine, bro. But also you're at the back of the pack. You keep getting passed over. Yeah, all right, I'll go. And then when you want to pass this car, you pass it, you go back in. All right, this is how the rules of the road are. So and I'm just going to clarify for everyone out there watching. Greg Miller has driven a car probably once in the last 10 years. Just want everyone to know that. And it was a Mini Cooper. It was his girlfriend's Mini. It must be so disturbing to you that you're just getting outclassed. You know, this be like, this would be like if I went and I beat you at climbing. I was better at climbing than you are. You would be because you're out there **** every day trying to be good at climbing. But your little **** fingers can't grab the rocks good enough, huh? But",

Once a day. Once a day I do that. No, you do it more than once a day. Well, because we've been eating in large more than once a day in house. I pee all the time at your house. I know. I only why you take so long to pee than it sometimes? Because I like to, I got my phone out. I'm on the forums. I'm hanging out. I'm reading stuff. I'm on the super official. I'm on TubeFilter.

Kevin, would you like some cookies? Yeah, you do. Kevin, would you like some cookies? Kevin, would you like some cookies? So easy to sue you guys. Yeah, but what you do?
