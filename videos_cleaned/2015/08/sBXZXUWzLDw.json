I'm not wearing shoes and I don't often wear shoes on the show but then I I finally just realized that none of us are wearing shoes right now. Yeah, we moved to we we we Colin paid for the people to come by and clean the carpets not too long a long and that's when we moved to being in a shoes off household. I respect that. Here's my thing that that rule does not apply on the shows. You always wear shoes on the shows. Really? Are you You're not wearing shoes. This is the first time ever I'm not wearing shoes. But I'm only not wearing shoes cuz they don't know that. Now they do. **** you guys. But don't you feel liberated? You'll cross your legs at some point in that shot and people will know. Don't you feel liberated by the fact that you're not wearing shoes? If you want to wear shoes for the show",
