This is going to be an interesting topic because I feel like Nick's gonna have a lot of opinions on it, but the reason I bring it up is this weekend or last couple days, uh, I've been staying with with my girlfriend and at her her parents' house and her little sister is addicted and her, I'm going to call her out, are addicted to the freaking The Bachelorette. Oh Jesus, that show is like totally fake. I mean, that's the thing. I'm watching it and it's like, holy ****, how could anyone like this? This doesn't make sense. It's all the super contrived romance speeches that the the entire show is two, it's a two-camera thing of just them going back having a **** conversation. I guess I can't really hate that too much. No, but there's a but but there's a difference and that and and you can look at the way they're actually marketing these as far as the award ceremonies are concerned, right? There's reality.

Now there's a bunch of different categories in reality. I'm going to get these totally wrong, but there's something where it's like documentary reality and then there's also scripted reality, which is a hilarious contradictory term, scripted reality. And that's what you're talking about, right? Is that The Bachelor is a show that if you look has writers and people telling them exactly what's supposed to happen and who's supposed to be bad and they're casting people specifically to like play up the dramatic aspects of these. So I think they're fine. I think it's fine to watch as long as you realize that it is a fake show. Yeah, it is a pure entertainment. So there's a couple things that that came from it 'cause I I I did not watch that much of it, but I was in a room like four hours later. He's like, I hope this chick wins. She's so",

I'd write it off as being like, why are you watching this? But every it's like a pop culture thing thing that isn't our group, but it's a **** thing. Oh yeah, the episodes are hours. Are they really? Yes, it's a hour weekly show. Are you sure it wasn't just like special? It's not just the final thing. It's hour show. I'm like, this makes no **** sense. So what happens is there's the originally there was The Bachelor. Are you familiar with The Bachelor, Colin? Yes. Okay, okay. So they I don't know. See, I don't know where your pop culture begins and ends. I'm you on this topic, but okay. All right, all right, then.

Then they started doing this stuff where they'd bring back people that like fan favorites from the prior seasons to be the Bachelor/Bachelorette. Actually, I think that's how The Bachelorette started. It was like a girl that didn't make it from The Bachelor that was a fan favorite. She got her own thing. Then now to the point, they're they like 10th, literally 10th season. So there's this whole group of ****. Now they made a new show called Bachelor in Paradise. And this this is where things get **** cool. They just take all the people that didn't make it, all the fan favorites and the ones that are hated and the **** weird Spacey Cadet ones and put them on a goddamn island.

Okay, so that's what happens. Put them on an island. But what's **** awesome about it is the Bachelor/Bachelorette have all these rules of like when you're like you're supposed to go on these dates, you're supposed to do this and whatever and people get but the Bachelor in Paradise, all that is is you get eliminated if you don't have a date. Like it's all based on hooking up. Like it's strategic hooking up with everybody. So it's like it totally goes away from the premise of the other ****. It's just like **** everybody.

Yeah, but then this Bachelor in Paradise thing happens and I'm sitting here like, I'm actually kind of into. Oh, wow. She's she has a sister. She brought her sister to the island. There's two of them. It's like, oh, one of them's a virgin, but one of them is the opposite of a virgin. One of a virgin. She she calls herself the opposite of a virgin. What is that?

It's just it's it's kind of disconcerting because and I think and I could be wrong, but I I think the reality television like genre has suffered a little bit because it suffers like everything else suffers where it's like someone figures it out that there's this amazing formula to shoot the show. It's basically like, you know, you don't have to worry about a lot of lighting. It's very low production value. Just shoot a ton of footage and bring it together in the edit. And then of course, there's a saturation point where everyone's like, oh, let's all do it. Then every network has a reality show. You got the bash, Survivor. Remember Joe Millionaire? I thought The Bachelor was Joe Millionaire. I was like, Joe Millionaire was the bomb, dude. So for those that don't know, The Bachelor is a show where there's one guy who's",

Joe Millionaire, same exact show except the entire premise is that he's a millionaire until the final episode where it's revealed that he's not a millionaire. Yeah, Joe Millionaire was the funniest thing ever. I watched that with my mom actually when I was in college. I would like go to her house on Sun. I think it was on like Sundays or Wednesday or something. I'd like sleep over that that house. So we we could just watch Joe Millionaire together. All right, so here's the thing. I think Nick hit on a salient point.

I think that's a natural place. It's it's the Wolfenstein of in terms of shooters of of reality shows. Um, it's a good analog. Thank you. And what's so funny about that show, not to say that other people weren't trying similar things, but the reality space was so quaint at that time that Real World was uncontested for a very long time. And it was really only MTV that was, you know, doing Road Rules, which I wasn't really into. Uh, Rock 'n' Jock ****, which was like, so remember Rock 'n' Jock? That that that stuff was awesome. Jesus. And so like, do you remember that? Like it was a thing where like they would take like rock, it would be like Rock 'n' Jock Baseball, whatever his MTV show.

So it's like it was so I really look at um, I don't T I don't think Tia Carrere was ever part of Rock 'n' Jock. Why Tia popped? Survivor issues. Now they Rockstar. There was a turning point. I think it I think Survivor was clearly the turning point on CBS that where this kind of formula started to work for network television. And that was when things got really **** up because there were actually still at that time novel ideas.

That's the most crazy thing is I remember him being The Mole and then now what was the keep seeing him? He's on CNN. The Mole guy. So The Mole is like a is like a a show where it's about uh, it's like people doing team activities and like trying to like compete and all these kinds of things on for various things, but one of them works for the show and is like sabotaging and the idea is to try to figure out who The Mole is.

That's when Joe Millionaire, which I think was 2003 when that came out. Uh, The Mole was like 2001 or something. Survivor was around. Yeah, Survivor was the one that really started and still going to the and then Big Brother came out and Amazing Race came out. It's really CBS actually because these are almost all CBS shows that really started to figure it out. And actually, they probably deserve a lot of credit and people probably made a lot of money there. The problem was when it started to proliferate around everything else.

But but to me, the winner, the two winners of what I feel like were actually really fun quality oriented post boom, uh, reality television was Bravo, who was still doing awesome work. And then uh, and then VH1. And VH1 doesn't really do that **** anymore. Like that was all V. VH1 had literally 10 shows that the guys that they would take like all the has-been celebrities.

It started from a documentary uh standpoint where someone's like, let's just put a bunch of kids in a house. Like a bunch of people from ethnically diverse backgrounds. Put them in a house someplace and just see what happens, right? And I'm sure there was a fair amount of editing happening. No matter what, you're still need to tell. You're still SC fo not a show. Yeah, so you're still trying to find a narrative somewhere in there because even documentary have narratives. You're still telling a story.

Like remember they had a thing they were like bunch of hot teens together on a bus doing cool stuff. Road Rules, right? Whatever, right? They're going from place to place. They have to do competitions to cool. That gives me some sort of like wrapper structure, right? Uh, Real World, they'll have to live in a house together. And then eventually on Real World, they're like, let's just get really hot people that'll have sex together. And then there was Real World: Las Vegas. And that I think is the apex of Real World.

And then eventually they're like, just put him in a hotel in Las Vegas and let him ****. Um, but then somewhere along the lines, uh, reality just became about following people's lives that are better than you. And that's where I feel like it kind of took a turn for the worst. Whereas like, you bring up Bravo. Well, uh, Bravo has The Real Housewives, right? And they're just they're fascinating human beings from a standpoint from from one standpoint is that most of them are very smart. A lot of them are self-made.

Maybe not in their own right, but to each other when put in the room, they are just terrible. And I have watched five episodes straight of this. And I don't know why I like it so much.
