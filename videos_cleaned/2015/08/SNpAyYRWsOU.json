I'm Greg, that's Nick, Kevin's in the back, that's Tim. We're driving home from VidCon. Tim, yes, you've been a **** all day. What's that about? I have been a ****. Are you hung over? I don't understand what's going on with you. What do you mean? You didn't put on your nice shirts, you didn't do your hair, you've been laying back there like you're all I've been hot 'cause we're in the **** Sunland and everything's really hot out here and I can't deal with it. So this morning I woke up and I was like, I'm about to be in a car, I want to be comfortable. I'm just going to wear a V-neck and not give a crap about anything or anyone. I'm just letting you know that it's just it's so un Tim, that's all. I mean, it's pretty un Tim. I get that, I get that. I just want to make sure you're okay. I I'm great. So last night I'm really good 'cause I have my Apple Watch got",

So last night I'm really good 'cause I have my Apple Watch got Mickey on it and I like a lot, lot of people like it, a lot of people, lot of people talking to you about it. So it was a conversation starter, that's why I got it. Yeah, I've started a lot of conversations. But last night I was they announced a while back that the OS is going to come out. Yeah, and I'm excited. I was like, oh, what features are going to be added? Maybe we'll finally make this something that's actually useful. Yeah, and then I was going through the list of things. One of the bullet points was like, oh, the Digital Crown is going to add uh more widgets for supports for this and this. I'm like, all right, cool. Then it's like, oh, the um you can change your your the picture to whatever picture you want. It's like, all right, cool. Press in the Digital Crown to initiate time travel and it's like, okay,",

Press in the Digital Crown to initiate time travel and it's like, okay, that's a pretty sizable upgrade. It said it in such a way that it was just like, oh, okay. And then like two bullet points down, then it describes what time travel is. But apparently Apple decided to call a feature time travel that lets you just look back at the past 7 hours of like events you've done or something like that. H, does that mean I whatever? I I honestly don't know. Okay, but last night at about 3:00 a.m. it was just me and Kevin and we were like rolling, laughing for a while. Like it's just like leave it to Apple to to redefine time travel. Apple Watch first version, I know no one likes it that much. We're adding time travel. Second version, time travel. I want to make a video about us describing how the Apple Watch is now going to change people's lives. When does that come out? Uh, fall. Oh, the",

When does that come out? Uh, fall. Oh, the next. That's a long time. Yeah, not really. Uh, it's July. We should really make that video. Yeah, we should. A good idea. Just you sending reading the terms, whatever. How the **** Apple Watch is going to change people and start **** with it. When is the when are they announcing this iPad SE? I'm going to assume September. It's getting close. Wait, wait, wait. Actually, I'm going to bet October 11th. Damn it. Pulling that out of my ass. Is that when they usually do the iPad anoun? No, they I feel like they merged their September and October things and I feel like they changed every once in a while. This year feels like an October to me. All right. Yeah, I want a suit than that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you feel me? I know what you're saying. You feel me, Daniel? I'm really feeling it. I'm feeling it. Hey, do you think",

I'm feeling it. Hey, do you think that at any point in the future they'll call the watchOS? I don't know. Let me let me check my my watch. Let me initiate time travel. Yeah, can you go forward with it too? You see what you're going to do tomorrow? That's OS 3. Uh, he's going to make videos in my house. I just wanted to be called, did you get one too, Greg? Tim, I want it to be called the WoS. Whoo. The watch. The watch O Watch. WoS. That's pretty good. It'll catch on. I like that. Thank you, Daniel Wilhoit, for all your support over on Patreon. We love you very much. Thanks for letting us do this. Be a bunch of goons. We love you.",
