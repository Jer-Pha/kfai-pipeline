But when did you decide you were ready for marriage? I've been dating my long-term girlfriend for 4 years now. We met in college in Kentucky and we both moved to New York City. I came to the city about 6 months before her and got an apartment. When she moved up to, she moved into my apartment. We lived together for 6 months. Now we've talked about marriage or at least a timeline a few times. We've got a very open and honest relationship and things are definitely moving that direction. So long story short, what are your thoughts on marriage timing discussions, etc? You know, I used to be actually kind of against marriage when I was in my 20s cuz I thought I just kind of looked at it as sort of like something people do uh when they're ready to stop living their life which is actually not the right way to look at it when you find the",

Um the issue is is I I don't think that in this day and age and this is just my personal opinion is I don't think you should get you should get married until you're in your late 20s and this is what I always tell people is that when you're in your early 20s you're still trying to discover who you are and sort of what you're going to bring to the table in a relationship. You don't really a lot of people it's been my experience you don't really have that understanding of who you are until mid 20s and then you can start developing that relationship with someone and really like I didn't get married till I was 30 and that was actually a great great thing for me",

Um but to answer the base question was when is it right when do you know it's right you never really know it's right you never know 100% that it's right anyone that's out there that tells you this is this is fate this is destiny like this is my soulmate this is the one for me I'm glad you feel that way but for the rest of us out there there's always going to be a fair modicum of doubt. Um but there's a fair modicum of doubt there there's doubt in everything you do right um so at that point you just have to go am I secure enough in myself and in this relationship and with this person to commit myself",
