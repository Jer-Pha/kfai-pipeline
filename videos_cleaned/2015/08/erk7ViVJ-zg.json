  "description": "It's Mission 1 (not the hospital) in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Let's save Miller!\n\nABOUT SPOILERS: Hey! It's me, Greg. I've played 60 hours of MGSV. (60 hours as of now. These Let's Plays are the first time I've touched it.) Nothing in these early let's plays will spoil the story. Yes, you will now know how missions begin and story elements, but the fun in MGSV is tackling these situations how you want to. Plus, the story elements you'll see here have been in trailers. I love the Metal gear franchise, and I wouldn't ruin it for you. Also, I know you're better than I am at MGS, so don't bother saying it in the comments. ;)\n\nSubscribe! https://www.youtube.com/user/kindafunnygames?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCome discuss MGS V on our forum: http://kindafunnyforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=3799\n\nThis video was edited on an ORIGIN PC EVO15-S Laptop. Get your PC here: http://www.ORIGINPC.com\n\nEach and every day, Tim Gettys, Greg Miller, and Colin Moriarty get together to talk videogames. \n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nColin - http://www.twitter.com/NoTaxation\n\nMusic by Rakohus!: http://www.youtube.com/user/rakohus",

I'm more than I'm excited that players are finally getting their hands on it and trying it out and learning for all the things we've been talking about for mon, all the things you've been hiding. We all the secrets we did they're revealed. We did the prologue as a Let's Play that'll be up after the fact. We want you to experience that sight unseen on September 1st. But, uh, you didn't even reveal that much there even though you said you would.
