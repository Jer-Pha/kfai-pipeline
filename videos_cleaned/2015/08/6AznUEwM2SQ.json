Go to kindafunny.com/forums, leave your topic in the Gamescast topic suggestions thread, and we'll get to them just like we did to all of these. Like Jose Lewis, when you were kids, what made you pick a certain game on the store and how does that change when we grow up? Box art. Yeah, that's all you had and Nintendo Power. It was dope. Like Contra just had the two dudes that looked exactly like Arnold Schwarzenegger just sitting on there like buffed out and I was like, I got to I got to play this. This is old game. I mean, that's really it and it's funny cuz like I think that's changed so much actually. I wonder if it has. I wonder if kids these days walk into GameStop and like look at the box art and just like I want this, you know, and I'm sure that happens, but I wonder if that is does Mcra have box heart? No, no.
