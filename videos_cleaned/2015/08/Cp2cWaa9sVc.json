He of course wrote Red Dead Redemption he wrote Manhunt and now he's co-written and now directed Air a movie with Norman Reedus. What's it all about? Air is a confined science fiction thriller. It's a post-apocalyptic science fiction movie. It has Norman Reedus and Jaimun Hounsu in it and if you like that sort of stuff you should check it out. Nick do we like that sort of stuff? We like that sort of stuff. We think you're gonna like that sort of stuff too so we wanted to tell you first Christian is on this week's GameOverGreggy show.

Get ready to go to the theater or watch it from the comfort of your home. We've brought you a clip. Christian thank you for all the time you spent with us today. Thank you guys it's a pleasure to be here. Enjoy the clip. You having a nightmare buddy? God damn it Bob. Gotta loosen the arm. This is quite plain and relevant. You can't do that. Gradual transition to a normal air mixture prevents what? Oxygen toxicity. Which can harm which organ? Ice-brained men. And lungs. I think somebody that just left six months would be in a better mood. Why does my text cycle take twice as long as yours? Give it enough time everything this dunk's gonna break. Did you clock in? No. Oh come on. I just don't want the other facilities to think that way again. What dead? Come on you can say it. It's not gonna kill you. There's weather",
