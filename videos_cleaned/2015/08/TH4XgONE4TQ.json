I was like, there's definitely some insertion going down tonight. Oh, whatever. I'm not going to get in your private life on that one, but make sure your heart rate stays under a certain.

Yeah, 30 is usually by the time we. 10 years left, right? Yeah, should get a physical of 30. You start getting the old uh, prostate. Woohoo! Yeah, the old hello, who's your father? How's your mother? And for that, I just I just go to my general practitioner. Yeah, you go to your your general, your GP, um, and uh, be like, hey, I'm 30, uh, let me get a physical and they'll they'll run you through the gamut. You don't get your prostate check until way later in life, though. Really? I thought you suppos. I think like 40 is when they start checking your prostate. Yeah, can you do it earlier if you want to? You can. You can always get your you can schedule a a meeting with your doctor right now, an appointment.",

I like it to be weekly. Yeah, yeah, you you'll have to pay for it, though. Insurance after a certain time, we'll probably figure out what you're doing and they'll be like, we're not going to cover this. Buh, had to gas. Buh, had a gas. It's been a fun drive. It has been a good drive. I'm realizing now, are we too far from going the other way? Yes. Okay. Yeah, we shot past that a while back. Okay. Why'd you want to go the other way? Why? I just feel like that would have made more. It would have been way faster, saved us 30 minutes easy. Whatever. Yeah, how can you not talk about family when family is all that you got?

You guys being **** about it wouldn't make fun of me now. I'm not making fun of you. We're critiquing Lunchables right now. I don't know if we ever agreed to that. To what? Stop.
