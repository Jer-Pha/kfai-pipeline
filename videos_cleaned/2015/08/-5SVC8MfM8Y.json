Fallout 4 is probably my most anticipated Triple A game really really stoked to play Fallout 4. I'm not excited about so here's what here's why I'm sad for you is because we'll lose you another one follow for comes out you're done pretty much you're done pretty much yeah I can't write in web chief I can't wait now it's fun I can't wait to uh to uh get down portal thank you goodbye uh I can't wait aside too high kaput uh so for him excited about I'm excited I mean games further up on tronic lecture will be cool this this uh oh my god and there's yet banter but there's also Uncharted 4",
