Still has that Gears speed. I forgot how fun it was to play MP. Yeah of course. Yeah. Going in cover to cover you know what I mean? Things like Torque. It was really fun when they broke us up and Alfredo just beat me to death over and over again. Before that we were like the duo. And that's the thing.

Obviously we already knew 40 bucks. We already knew August 6th. Yep.

Playing co-op. And of course if you get the Ultimate Edition you get into the beta for Gears 4. So here we go. It's Act One. They've gone through they said all the cut scenes are redone. All the levels and maps are redone. You know what I mean? Keeping that original vibe but going through and making it Xbox One awesomeness. And it's coming to Windows 10 but it was playing on PC.

But uh I remember the first time I got to actually play a lot of Gears and see a lot of Gears was I I was still living in Columbia working at the Tribune and I did a story on a Marine who was shot by a sniper in Iraq right?
