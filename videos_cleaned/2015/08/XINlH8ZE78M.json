Yeah, okay, here's my thing. I didn't like high school all that much. I like my, I didn't like school part of it, right? Like a teacher, like kind of I had with my friends or whatever, but I don't look back on it with like, I really like high school and like I'm always, you know, like when the high school wants money, I never give it to him. When Mizzou wants money, I'm like, here's some money. You know what I mean? Like I, I love Mizzou, didn't like my high school or whatever. Yeah, I didn't like any school that much. Here's my, well, one day you will. I don't know. All right, well, just give me your money and I'll give it to Mizzou. Okay, we can get you a Tim Gettys' brick at Tiger Walk or something you want.

Now here's my, here's where this comes down to is that I feel like there's a ton of movies that are set in high school that always make me go, oh man, I'm nostalgic for, wait, I don't like high school. I, I find American Pie, yeah, American Pie, DUFF recently, that Almanac movie, like it's all these things of like, you're hanging out with your friends and you're do, like I hang out with you idiots every day and it's great, but it's not like that and it's, and I don't know if it ever like, even when we sit there and I'll tell you my Smash Brothers, when we had the Smash Brothers championship and we all played at a Michael Bryan's house and we lived there every weekend or whatever, like those were great.",

You know what I mean? Like I had a great, I had a great core of high school friends, don't get me wrong. I just really hated high school. Like I got to the end of like, you know, sophomore year, middle of sophomore year, I was like, you know, I'm not taking a backpack home anymore.

I think, uh, a good experience, I, that kind of relates to what you're talking about is when I was in, I was graduating high school in 1998 and I realize a lot of you don't remember that time because you were both, you were all zygotes. Um, but in 1998, a movie called Can't Hardly Wait. Oh yes. And that movie was about graduating high school and going to the year end party and like, uh, you know, tying up loose ends, as it were, right? Everyone, everyone had their thing that they, you know, needed to accomplish before they moved on to their, to their young adulthood. Um, and I remember sitting watching that movie going, oh man, this is awesome.

And I got to the movie, I was like, wow, that was great. That really encapsulated sort of my entire high school experience. Wait a minute, no, it didn't. Like I had moments of it, yeah, where I was the Ethan character, right? I was the guy that had a crush on a girl for like three years and would write her letters and my friends would be like, dude, like, shot at this. You're not. Like I had, I always tell the story of I had one good friend, Stu. He's, he's still my good friend in this day. You've met Stu. I met Stu. Um, and Stu, I was in love with this girl in high school all throughout high school and Stu would literally like, he would slap me. He would actually physically assault me.

Um, and so that was my experience, which was I didn't get the girl. Yeah, right? I never got the girl. I got other girls, but I got other girls because I wanted that girl so badly that the other girls are like, this dude is so unavailable right now, that's sexy. I'm going to go after him. And by sexy, I mean, I thought I was sexy. I was like a little pudgy kid in high school. Um, so, so yeah, I see that in that the, the overarching themes of coming of age, which is what all high school movies are about in, in some way, shape or form, I think are universal and that's what we relate to is the nostalgia of remembering when we were discovering the world for the first time, when we were.",

But the girls that I idolized and put up on pedestals, the ones that were the, the, the Jennifer Love Hewitt's, um, or the, I forget who the hot girl was in, uh, I guess it was a foreign exchange student in American Pie. That's Shannon Elizabeth. I didn't get that girl. I didn't get close to getting that girl. I, I saw other guys get that girl. Tara Reid.

Yeah, of course, John Hughes, the John Hughes films, like, you know, Breakfast Club, uh, uh, Sixteen Candles. The thing is like, I don't, what's weird for me is that I feel like I understand why so many movies happen in high school because I remember in high school, you went to the movies in the weekend. It's where you could all go and congregate and not have it be weird that you're all like there, 30 people at somebody's house or whatever, when their parents are trying to get something done. But you go to the movies and you're there. So they make a high school drama to get the high school or whatever, a high school movie to get kids to come see it, to spend their money and da.

Like it's a weird thing. Like I said it and you're like, I'm crazy. It's like, I just have a bad taste in my mouth about the school part of it, not hanging out with my friends, not doing plays, not doing the new, I mean, no one likes school. Like that's specifically like high school, middle school, elementary school, like the school part of it. I don't think anybody has ever in the history have ever been like, man, I **** love homework. That's just not a thing.

And I was thinking The DUFF, like there's that one scene where she's in chemistry and she's like mixing **** and beakers or whatever and it made me think of whatever that high school class was where we were in lab and had to do stupid ass **** like that, right? Well, here's my thing, man. Freaking dissecting frogs. I was promised this ****. You didn't do. I had to do it. No, I did it. They wouldn't let us. It's like, and you went to hippie-dippy San Francisco school, man. All this have they gave us a rock and they said, go out and get the frog. Greg's got a picture of himself with the frog.

So here's the, here's why I think high school, like I, we did a conversation with Kevin about this and I talked about high school is largely meaningless. I hate, I hate when people, I hate when people in, in terms of like this, like marquee time. I always think about Uncle Rico and, and, uh, uh, Napoleon, uh, like when I see these things, like these high school reunion things, you have to be **** kidding me. Not a prayer. You know, yeah. Uh, but I think back on those times, like you guys were saying, in terms of my friends and those experiences that we had together. Um, and I still have some really good friends, not, not, I don't talk to many people from school anymore, but I went to high school with my girlfriend and we're, and we're 30 years old now.

Um, but I, we went, we went, we come from the very same place, which is why I think, you know, we kind of understand each other on a weird level. And like I'm going to my, my best childhood friends, Mike Pope's wedding, uh, as one of his groomsmen, um, just next month and we grow up across street from each other. So there's all these, there's all these seminal memories that I think we tie up into the event. Like when we think, let me put it in another, in another way, when we think about IGN, our time there, we spent between five and nine years at IGN as editors and whatever else we were doing there. We don't think, when we think back on it, we don't think about the work necessarily. We don't think about the day-to-day grind.

We think about our friends and the experiences we had there and I think it's a, it's a very similar kind of thing with high school. I think high school resonates a lot because it is the moment in time coincidentally when your, the thumb of your parents is getting lifted off of you for the first time and you're starting to find yourself for the first time and really discover things and do stupid **** and you know, you discover girls or boys or whatever it is and you, you might, you know, smoke weed for the first time or you might have a drink for the first time. It's like these are seminal moments in your life that like, you know, you just remember and I think it just happens to coincide with school and therefore you kind of tie in the memory of high school with the memory of, of, you know, of, of the time itself.

Like to me it was high school for sure. College was just worthless to me. Like to totally, totally, totally worthless. There's not a single real memory I have from it that I'm, that's heartbreaking. See, that's heartbreaking for me because I just obviously idolized college so much and, you know, loved college so much the same way. I mean, I would, you all got your **** film degrees. That's your problem. Well, no. Um, yeah, but that, that to me was the best part of college, right? It was when I discovered that like, I wanted to pursue film in some way, should perform as a career.

It was like, okay, went to college, that was great. Really wouldn't want to do that again. Didn't feel any need or tie to want to go to grad school. I was like, I'm pretty much done with this. I don't think it gave me a specific leg up in the world. Um, specifically being from, you know, wanting to go into Film Production. I think I probably would have done better if I'd spent the last three years of my college driving back and forth to LA and just holding up a sign that to hire me.

It was just about making YouTube videos and getting noticed by places like IGN, which you could have done without college. Totally. I mean, that's the thing is like, I guess probably could have done better without college, actually. We talked about this a bazillion different times, but like I, I feel like I had all those questions answered in high school, so I kind of was already on that path and if anything, college was just holding me back. Like all the GE classes and like having to do all this stuff that didn't matter. Pretty much college is very important in proving that you can get things done and can be responsible and it's proving to employers and all these people that you are not useless and that you can get **** done timely and all that stuff.

Um, yeah, for me though, you know, high school, going back to the original question, high school was very important for me because it was the first time you were around that age like range of people, right?

So when you were in like, oh, like movies were representing who you were. Well, no, it was when you were, you were, you were 14 when there were 18-year-olds around you, right? Oh, and so like, you know, when you're in grade school, you're, you know, you don't really see the, the age difference too much between like a fourth grader and a sixth grader. There is. You have, I was going to say, well, I remember the fifth graders, they might as well have been 18. Sure. But they weren't buying cigarettes. They weren't drinking. They weren't experiencing with drugs. They weren't doing all these things. Whereas the reason why I think a lot of people hold, uh, high school in that high regard is because for some or for many, actually, it is when you broaden quickly. You go from being a 13-year-old kid to suddenly 14 where you're a freshman in high school and there were 18-year-olds who were boating, driving, smoking.",

And then you realize later on the life that he just sold drugs. Um, I like that makes sense because you can make a lot of money selling weed apparently, but it's still illegal in most states. Um, but yeah, that was, that was when you were like, holy crap, there's so many things that I'm figuring out. Whereas I got to college and I also had an older brother, so I got to college and everyone was like, oh, let's go get drunk and let's do all this stuff. I'm like, me.",

I'm like, me, I've been doing that since I was 13. Like, cuz my brother's always been five years older than me. So I was 13, he was 18. And so he was entering college when I was entering high school. So I would party with all of his friends. So by the time I got to college, I was like, I don't really not the idea of getting really messed up and having a house party and, and going crazy. The, the allure had sort of worn off a little bit for me, uh, because I experienced a lot of that. I a high impact of that right when I got in high school. Plus I went to the same high school as my brother. So all the teachers that love my brother were like, what's up, Scarpino? Like I went to theater and my, my, um, theater teacher, Ms. Gress was awesome and she, uh, she just was like, God, I got another Scarpino. This is going to be again, it's like a.",
