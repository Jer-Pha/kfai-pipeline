      "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome to Kinda Funny games. My name is Colin Moriarty. Today we're going to do some sort of kind of let's play long play of Super Mario Brothers 2. I don't think I'll get through the whole game or anywhere close to it, but we'll play it for a while and and uh figure out where we are. Uh so like I did with Castlevania 3 and other games, we'll just continue to kind of enjoy the game and and work our way through it. And and for you guys that don't know, obviously Mario 2 is not the real Mario. This is something that we all kind of felt shocked by when we learned about in the early 2000s or late 90s. Um but Mario 2 was a special game to us on the NES, came out in 1988. Um and uh was really just a reskinning of a Japanese game as you probably know by now called Doki Doki Panic. Um but it kept with the uh with kind of the style of games of that time which was uh make a game then make a sequel that is very different. So you saw that with Mario, you saw that with Castlevania, you saw",

So you saw that with Mario, you saw that with Castlevania, you saw that with oh jeez, you saw that with uh Zelda, etc. and so on. So it wasn't super uncommon. Saw that Metal Gear, oh jeez. So I haven't played the game in a while and and I've always really enjoyed it. I I kind of loved the game on the NES and then you can play it on SNES on Super Mario All-Stars, but I actually rediscovered my love of this particular game um when it came out on uh Game Boy Advance um as a launch game. It was called Super Mario Advance and uh I was like, you know, this is a really super special game um that I think a lot of people kind of disown because oh it's not a real Mario game, but had you not known that, would you still love it? And that was always the question I kind of asked um and the answer is yes, I think this is a great game. Is it as good as the original Mario? No, is it as good as",

No, is it as good as Mario 3? Hell no, but it's it's it's still a fantastic game in its own right and I and I love it. So we wanted to play it for you a little bit here um and I'm going to try to play straight through. I don't really want to cheat and like take side side cuts and or shortcuts rather and whatnot. So we'll just play and for people that are wondering, I'm playing here as uh as my dude Toad um who I love very much. Um let's see N I already screwed that up and I just said I didn't want to take St Cuts so what am I doing? Let's go with this one. It's like muscle memory. So here if you're you know uninitiated with this game, you pick up the coins that you can then use on a slot machine to get extra lives at the end of each stage and the mushrooms that you pick up uh give you a permanent extra life here for at",

So you can actually stand on top of these guys and use them as platforms if you want or you can use this cloud pick up vegetables. So a lot of people like you know using the different characters. I like Toad, he picks things up quickly which I think is useful. He's got good speed. Um some people like you know using Mario, Luigi's, I think Luigi and Peach I think are the worst characters. I think they're totally unwieldy, especially Peach, but the way Luigi jumps, Luigi has like a high like crazy high jump that I just hate, but it's useful in some places. This is Berto, you got to fight Berto like 7,000 times in this game. He shoots eggs and you just pick them up, you jump on them, pick him up and that should be the end. Then he drops this little thing you pick",

Then he drops this little thing you pick that up and you go into the little bird mouth and this is where this all happens and I've never been good at this. There is like a Cadence to it, but I'm just bad at it. So we'll just kind of work our way through it. You always want to hear that, but I'm just going to keep hearing this over and over again. Jeez Louise, I can't catch a break here. Kevin, jeez Louise. Oh, ah, there we go. Yay, I got a life. All right, so we pick Toad. Toad gets shat on a lot, but Toad's the dude. He's a little slippery though. All right, so we need the magic carpet here. So we jump on it, we throw him off and then we scadaddle and you kind of get to the bottom here to avoid these these bees, although you're going to have to come up here to avoid that and then we can actually oh God, there we go, throw this down here and get",

I you don't have to go back through the door, but you can, it's fun. Get the one up down there and then we'll go here and when you grab the key, these guys freak out, but you can throw it as a weapon, which is cool and then you just use a ton to lock the door later on. That's kind of just a test bed later on. You hold have to hold the key for a really long time and those guys just chase you forever and it's a pain in the ass. These guys are little shit. Oh God, shit off. All right, so we place the bomb, we don't really need to do that, but we will. Oh, get out of the way here, we can go around. This is only going to destroy one of them, but we could do a little thing here where you there you go. So here you can use those to jump up or you can",

I don't know why the hell I remember this, throw that there and then we can just go crazy on a bunch of coins that will end up being useless because I won't get any extra lives out of them. So her will fight Berto again because he just won't go away or she oh jeez, here we go. You think I'll get any Kev? No, I think you'll get one. I wish you could hear the noise because the no, it's like such a disappointing noise that you just hear over and over again. Oh, let's try a different way. There is a way to do it and I don't remember what it is not every time, but like to oh my God, what a waste. I had 10 coins. Jesus Christ, awful, just an awful showing.

You see you don't want to throw these potions just anywhere because it's like a huge waste of resources. So like this is a good place to throw it and I like to carry sometimes, but you don't necessarily have to. There was a fish there that I killed, but he's back. God and Toad is a spry son of a bitch. Which one of these is there one of these is a potion? I don't remember which one it is is the middle one. God damn it. God damn it. I know one of these is it yeah, there it is. Oh well, just one.

I got that that uh dodgeball game and then I got um Castlevania Circle of the Moon which is an awesome game and then I got Mario Advance which I was so excited on it really did give me like a new appreciation for the game because that around that time it's when you were like oh it's not a real Mario game like what does it matter really it's still fun I could use some health I'm probably going to die at some point which is no bueno yeah this is all timed shit up here let's see there we go and then yeah here is where shit gets a little crazy so you just got to kind of like stay away from me oh God get back up",

Kevin, I'm only talking to Kevin because no one else is here to listen to me. All right, so now the face go away, the face goes away if you drop the key. So some people play play the game a little timidly which is you know not a bad way to play it. Oh God, so you go back and you reclaim it. All right, so you kind of got to yeah, just okay oh God, he's going to come back away for me. Oh God, he hasn't shown himself yet, but he's around somewhere. All right, we're good.
