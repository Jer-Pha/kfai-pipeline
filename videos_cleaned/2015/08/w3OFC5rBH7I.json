It's a chew to just both food and chews are sure to be a showstopper. Surely, shoot. He's so excited, but he knows there's other stuff. Emerald Pet Piggy Twizzies, made of USA, made in the USA, and free of grain, gluten, soy, and dairy. These 100% all-natural chews are sure to be a showstopper. He bit right through that. What are you like, super teeth power? I thought you're just tearing this thing up. I thought this would ease on you chew on for a long time. Look at you go to town on it. Alright, over here we got My Doggie Soft Baked Cookies. Though they're cheap, this is the cheesy variety of these. Yeah, there you go. Good boy. Just sit there and chew it. Enjoy your life. It's",

It's your time. Let's see. Let's read about what we got here for My Doggie. My Doggie Cheesy Cookies. What's better than a soft, doughy cookie? One that's cheesy and wheat-free. To lucky pup. Now this is where the trade-off says that Portillo want. Oh my goodness, Portillo. What do you suppose it? Oh yeah, you see there's a new because I knew it. I knew it's a new treat, Portillo. You can't wait. Oh, you get crumbs all up in your bed. That's not good. This bed needs to get washed now, doesn't it? Mm-hmm. Settle down. Okay. No, just, just sit. Just, well, here. If you're looking for more crumbs all up in the bed, there's stuff all over. One, see, we got ants in this house over here. What do we got now?",

What Kyle loves duck. Grain-free but full of roasted duck goodness. These goodies will make your pup go ducking crazy. You see, Nick, it's like autocorrect. You know that one? Yeah, you ever fall for that one? You're trying to, are you talking hate you? Oh, okay. Slow, slow. I didn't get one. I don't get you one yet. Here. Now look at the camera and be cute eaten in your bed. More crumbs in the bed. Tell yourself the animal. Now here's we get into the toys and the goodies that Portillo will one day love. Of course, every month the BarkBox comes. Every month Portillo freaks out. And every month he just eats himself stupid on the stuff that comes out of the BarkBox. He's not hung up on the toys right now.",

He's not hung up on the toys right now. When he will be, when he's done. This is our first one here. This is the BarkMade Bearded Lady. Just like the good old days, this circus wouldn't quite be complete without a Bearded Lady. Now Portillo will love this for a long, long time. But right now he's obsessed with the food, of course. Yeah, I get you like this. This is gonna be your best friend, Portillo. Now use one. Either he doesn't, he doesn't care about the toy right now. But eventually he will. And you'll see this Bearded Lady on all the Kinda Funny things. And finally, this thing with them. This thing, Zig-Zig-Ooh Pets Veg Out BarkBox Tip Stuff. This USA-made toy with peanut butter, baby carrots, or a room to treat and freeze for a long-lasting healthy snack. I see a little home way, a little do-it-yourself project, a little Chinese finger trap.",

Doesn't make noise when I rub it on your head though, either. So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, another BarkBox unboxing here on YouTube.com/KindaFunny. Remember, BarkBox is a subscription service where you sign up. They send your dog treats and goodies and toys and bandanas sometimes each and every month. If you go to BarkBox.com/KindaFunny, you can sign up right now and get an extra month for no charge. Again, as usual, I mean, no surprise, Portillo loved this one. Maybe again, the Bearded Lady will be the one that hangs out with us the rest of his days. But the food is just being decimated right now. He is just ravenous. You think we don't feed the dog? Believe it or not, we feed him quite a bit, Carl. We",
