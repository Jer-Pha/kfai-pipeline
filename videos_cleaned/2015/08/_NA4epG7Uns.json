I think that the commercial imperative is on Naughty Dog to make The Last of Us 2 because The Last of Us sold extraordinarily well. I don't know the exact numbers, but I feel like The Last of Us must have sold better than any Uncharted installment, any one. Yeah, yeah, I see her saying, yeah, probably. Um, so they're going to make another one. I mean, that's just, that's just obvious. I would, I don't feel, I don't feel like it's necessary, but if it was up to me, I would certainly want them to make more than one more. I feel like that world is ripe for the **** picking, man.

Like Joel's brother, who the, yeah, Joel's brother, like, who the **** are these people, you know? Um, like, who really are the Fireflies? And so there's like all sort, and there's interesting places to see and like, what's going on in the rest of the world and doesn't have to be in the United States. So the thing is like, I think with Nathan Drake, right? We're theoretically sick with me, right? We're living in Nathan Drake's world right now. He's **** ganting off right now in Costa Rica and doing cool ****, but you and I are podcasting, whereas in The Last of Us, everyone's in a **** up situation. How are people surviving?

And I don't necessarily disagree with that sentiment because it's, it's very similar. We're talking about True Detective. Uh, the first season True Detective was phenomenal, and I only watched the first episode of the second season True Detective, and I **** hated it, and I never watched any of it. And lo and behold, everyone **** hates it. And it's like, sometimes you need to leave, you know, leave alone, let it have the legacy it deserves, just leave it alone.

And what would be really cool, and this is a The Last of Us spoiler, we'll put our hand down when the spoiler's over. It would be cool if each, each, uh, game started before the event, before the fall. Oh, dialing farther and farther back and then like, gives you context about why things happened the way they happened. That'd be interesting. There's a lot of you, exactly.

I, I talk about The Last of Us and I, I'd love for it to be left alone because I feel like if there's a studio that can get us, and I don't mean, I don't, I hate comparing us to movie video games to movies, you know what I mean? Like, I don't like that, I don't like that whole argument. But like, there is something to be learned there in the fact that Martin Scorsese can make another Martin Scorsese film and they don't, it, it is in Casino 2, you know what I mean?

There's so many different things I want to **** do in that world. But right now, I, I also do want to see video game companies and publishers not be afraid of sequels. And The Last of Us was really the first time in a while, I feel like, where it was like, hey, the guys who brought you Uncharted are making this game and boom, it's a huge success.

Yeah, I think Naughty Dog has an interesting advantage too, which is that a lot of developers don't have. I, I, I feel like you could count on one hand the amount of developers that have this advantage, which is that people will buy anything they put out. Like, they've earned such respect that The Last of Us sold based not only on its great reviews, but sold based on the fact that it was a Naughty Dog game. If that, if that, if The Last of Us was made by Sony Bend or something like that, no disrespect to those guys because we love them too, people have been much more skeptical and then would have sold later, yeah, and longer if, if after the reviews came out.

But I don't, there's something sacred about the new IP, but there's also something sacred about exploring, not being afraid to explore things that need to be explored more. Like Uncharted 4 is probably the last Uncharted game, at least from Naughty Dog. And I think that sucks. Why can't Uncharted exist forever? Like, if, if you feel like, if you feel like you can say something meaningful, it doesn't have to be, it just, in other words, it's not just like **** it out because it's an Uncharted game, but it's saying like, why limit yourself? Like Drake can never have another story after this. Why not? You know, like, it's, it's, it goes both ways.

And I think that that's something uniquely games. And I feel like what gets me excited about The Last of Us 2, which is inevitable, is think about Drake's Fortune and then think about Among Thieves. Like, that's all you need to think about. Yeah, the leap there. Like, there's a massive, **** massive leap between those two games, significant. And they can do the same thing with this game, you know? And I think that they will. I, I, I think just knowing what Naughty Dog's capable of, knowing that we know those guys personally over there, we know a lot of those people at that",

And I think that, I think that, um, The Last of Us 2, like, the people should, unlike a lot of other game sequels where you get a little bit of trepidation, whatever, I think we go into The Last of Us 2 expecting it to be even better than The Last of Us. And I think that not only do we expect that, I think that it's entirely possible and maybe even likely. Oh, yeah, sure, you know? So it's, if that's the case, then why not? I mean, it's the same reason why I'm excited about Uncharted 4 because it, the worlds are different, it's much more ground, it's pulpy and all that kind of stuff.

Or in other words, you have a story that you want to tell and you have a world and a theme. Yeah, but Bond can be many different people, you know, and he's still Bond, right? Exactly. But Drake can still be Drake. Like, why not have a different Drake? Why not have his son? Why not have, you know, like something else or a story that focuses on different characters in that world? All I'm saying is that we shouldn't necessarily be trepidacious just for the sake of being trepidacious. We should be excited that people might be able to explore things that are good over and over again, like they did with Castlevania, for instance, back in the day, or like they did on the NES with Mega Man, or like",

And there's no bad Mario games, you know, unless you kind of like Mario Is Missing! or something like that. But I mean, in terms of core Mario games, Mario Sunshine. Mario Sunshine's fantastic. So I don't know, I just want to throw that out there that I understand the trepidation about new IP and exploring different things, but we have to all understand that we can get good things when we really bury them, like bury ourselves in, in a sequel or, or in a third game because the, the tale is always the same, Greg.

So they might not have had the funds. Now that they're owned by Sega, you would think that they would be able to skip this ****. But you have to understand too that these deals might have been in place for a long time, long, excuse me, long before Sega was, you know, purchased Atlus. In other words, that there just might be a deal saying like, we publish your games in Europe. I mean, that's just the way it is. Does it affect you? No, doesn't affect you at all.

Like, I, I, I think, I mean, clearly Bloodborne was a reflection on that. Sure, make good. Yeah, like, but they really dropped the ball because Dark Souls could have been a PlayStation exclusive for them completely. Can you imagine?

Yeah, I, I mean, and I don't blame him. I mean, like, if I played that game, I remember when Sam Bishop reviewed it first, he gave us like a 9.3 from back on IGN. I remember that. And I remember we were late on the review too. It was a game we were ignoring. Yeah, because we like, who the **** cares about this? Yeah. Um, and we eventually got a review out like several weeks after the game came out and he gave it a high score. And that game had a slow burn.

A bunch of, well, I'm just saying that's, that's some of the most moronic **** I've ever heard in my life. I can't believe that publishers went like, looked at that game and looked at Iga who's working on it. Is it, what game? No, I don't need this. Thanks. Like, what are you crazy?

Yeah, I mean, you know, a good one, and this is, I'm taking a little bit differently. I think the attack, it's more of a mechanic, I guess, but like the torture sequence in Metal Gear Solid.

A great mini-game is Gwent. I was going to say, well, bad mini-games, Gwent, just to **** with you. I thought The Witcher. Like, I feel like that, I feel like it's inevitable that that's going to be a standalone game. Oh, God, probably. Jesus Christ. That's a great example of an iPad game that people actually like. Hearthstone. Yeah, yeah, well, it's on PC too. Yeah, there you go. So it doesn't count. Um, yeah, I don't know.",

Uh, very much, very much, very much. Uh, doubling back because I made this point, popped up in my head and then I never said it because I forgot and we got caught up in something else. You're talking about doing Uncharted with somebody else. Why does it have to be Nathan Drake? I counter with Infamous. Oh, that should, it should always been Cole. Should bothered. I think when you get like, if they do The Last of Us 2 and it's not Joel or Ellie, then we're going to be like, oh, cool, this is the universe that exists. I think Uncharted is too locked in at this point that it's for Nathan Drake. It's got to be Nathan Drake. Yeah, it's more about hypothetical. I don't know if I necessarily really in",
