But if you listen to the GameOverGreggy Show, you heard Colin G given Kevin over there the old, he's the opposite of a ballerina, rigoll. Yes, but Kevin does these things to stay out of frame sometimes where he's like, he was pressed up against the wall a second ago, like s s yeah, exactly. It's just like he he tries like a broke down Solid. Yeah. Can you imagine that just a short of Kevin as Solid? I can see it. I can see the eyach and the Not So Solid B.

I feel like Kevin for you know, Kevin doesn't move quickly, but he moves at a normal speed, but I feel like the in the directions in which he falls and stumbles indicates that he has incredible inertia. Like like Kevin's a body that's always in movement, you know what I mean? And he don't forget he did beat Shawn Finnegan in a foot race at IGN before we left. So yeah, something about that's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then without fail, he'll trip on it and it'll pull the headphones, it'll pull everything and I don't know if you guys noticed this, but he always takes his headphones and like puts him on the side of the table and it's just like Kevin, don't do that because you **** knock him over.

I'm quick like that , but I don't have the technical skills that Kevin has see so there's a little bit of a difference there a little bit. Kevin can use a soundboard, he can use a camera, but he falls a lot. I can catch things in the air using my go tending prowess, but you wouldn't find me editing a video. True.

Had a little uh Kickstarter go up and it's breaking all types of records and stuff. Fastest um funded game ever. It got a million in six hours. That a Tim Shaver was a million pounds or a million dollars? Was it million dollars? Million. Yeah, so like 750,000, 700,000. Yeah, and so it's a it's a pretty big pretty big deal and it's you know, it's kind of made up by former Rare employees and stuff.

Is this a unique thing and is this just a nice little like is this the future of retro revivals? Like we've seen a lot of the 8 bit, we've seen a lot of the 16 bit.

No might I down the road maybe I I we did we talked about the Kickstarter and Colin and Greg live. We went and did the thing. It didn't I think they're cute characters or whatever, but I was never a Banjo fan. Like Banjo Kazooie never spoke to me. So I'm really not like, oh this is what I've been craving, but I'm trying not to hold my just never caring, you know, my un bash uncaring of Banjo Kazooie against this game cuz if they were to say not Naughty Dog or whatever, but if somebody was to make another Jack and Daxter right, like I'd be oh, I'd be interested in playing that if it was more like Precursor Legacy or whatever I'm talking about , you know, third person Adventure, you know what I mean?

Like it's not doing anything for me when when uh Nuts and Bolts came out and everyone at IGN tried to convince himself that was a great game. I was like, I this isn't I don't like this. What are you talking about brv? You know what I mean? Like that wasn't a thing for me and it's just not a franchise that speaks to me. So I don't want to hold it against this, but like is the era of these games over or whatever, like it's been gone a while. I feel like you haven't seen anybody come out and really commit to this in a long time. That's interesting. I'm interested to see what happens in this genre. I mean what was the the last one?

There has I mean the 3D World and but there's still there's still 3D Platformers though. Yeah, that's still like a 2.5D kind of like to me. I mean not literally 2.5D, but that's like kind of a half step. But yeah, you're right. I mean it is still a 3D platformer. Sure, sure.

So it was like I was just in a different space in gaming in that time. So I don't have the love of that era of Rare games that other people do and I appreciate that people you know, and that's not NE I like D7 and stuff, but you know, there's that portion of Rare's history is something that people very fondly remember. I remember more of like the Donkey Kong Country era and stuff like that something a little bit before where like that was their Str they hit their stride. The a few things hit me with this.

This is the what what we did we made cartoony blocky **** Platformers that people like ate up and loved whether it was Mario 64 whether it was Banjo Kazooie or whatever it was and I wonder then what's different because I feel like you and I came of age in that time when I I always talk about the Blockbuster Game Pass when I'd go there and just rent game after game and there were so many of these and I feel like that's why I'm satiated.

I remember when Banjo came out clear's day. I was like in 11th grade. It's like not that old but like but that is the that is the retro that is retro now for a lot of people and a lot of people that kind of look fondly back on that and it is when you think about the Natural Evolution I don't think that we would have seen the pixel-based like kind of sprite based things we've been seeing were the were natural because that shit's awesome but like this **** can be awesome too and so it makes a lot of sense to um to have that",

Sega didn't come up with a solution. Well, they had Nights was one solution and then and then what Nights was kind of you know its own kind of track based more linear but open game and then Mario was like a completely open game that lacked textures because they didn't have the room and then Crash was a textural heavy game that was linear those were their Solutions and that was like what was so fascinating they had no idea no one knew what the other hand was doing and so this won yeah and uh clearly um and so I'm excited about it.

These guys are going to get millions of dollars more than they they got a million in six hours and like that's crazy. I think one of the and I might be wrong about some of this, but I think the the most funed thing was the Veronica Mars movie and and that got a million in 4 hours and that's crazy like that's not that far off yeah like I would have never thought well we how many people have been waiting for this forever you know what I mean?

I know there's a lot, but I didn't know there was that much . Yeah, you know, like it does surprise me that I mean like, you know, something like Mighty Number 9, like Mega Man. Banjo-Kazooie, I wouldn't necessarily say Banjo's the bigger game, you know what I mean? It's the more relevant game though. It's funny how we've seen this evolution in terms of like Mighty is a good example where, you know, Mighty Number 9 got a substantial amount of money and it took time, but they did it and Aon did his thing. But this was funded more by people like my age or Greg's age that grew up with these games and now the people that grew up with Banjo in their formidable years have money.",

And as my own opinions on um crowdfunding have kind of ebbed and flowed over time, I mean this isn't a game that I think couldn't have been published because I think there are probably publishers that are that are interested in this game. Maybe before they release it, maybe they didn't even try to get a publisher. I wonder if this game will get a publisher, which will piss me the **** off if they do. Um, because they don't need it.

I want I want Crash for well they're going to have to get yeah, the permission to use that. I'm sure I'm sure Activision is going to make a Crash game at some point at some point.
