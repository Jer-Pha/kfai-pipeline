Nope, I can't. I hate that. Okay, so we're using the left stick and we're playing on Xbox One of course. So I can get, I have a screwdriver no and I have a sock. I'm just going to put this out there, they don't often let you have screwdrivers in prison. No, no, mostly because people use them to shank other people. Mhm. And right in the neck.

Well man Isaiah, so you know, you really, you know what the hell is the old man going to do? He's not going to shank anyone with it. No, he's a real piece of ****. What I'm really curious about is what he's in for and if I really want him to be escaping at all. Tell you one right now man, that old man murders probably. He's been in there for children or something really brutal like that. You know where he like took out an entire school bus of kids and then do we really want him to escape? Do we really want him to?

So now I can craft, we're going to make him a new cavity. Let's see what we can craft. I can so I'm going to be able to select the sock and I'm going to be able to select the bar of soap.
