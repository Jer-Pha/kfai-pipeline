Not my favorite character in Smash though, I got to say, back when he was in Melee. So we're all playing Mewtwo. We are all playing. Have you played as him yet? I have not. I mean, I played as, I used to play in Melee. I'm going pink Mewtwo. I'm doing the blue. Yeah, maybe no. All right, I'm dark blue. I I don't know what color I am. Let's see. I'll do yellow. Oh, did I go dark? It's just his pubic hair. That's a different color, huh? Oh, it's his tail. It's it's actually it's it's his dick goes back down right now. Are we doing what are we doing here?

Okay, it's good that they're using all the precious room in the roster to make characters out. Don't like other characters. Well, yeah. All right. God forbid they put Ice Climbers in this thing.

Well, he's I thought you were kidding when you said he was was Dragon Ball. Yeah, I know he wasn't Dragon Ball, guys. I thought he was. I thought you were kidding. I was kidding, Nick, everyone. Why weren't you kidding about it, Greg? Get off me, bro. Uh oh. I I wasn't even over there until you knocked me out. Mewtwo had a very troubled path. He's a man-made Pok\u00e9mon. Oh my God.

You could have been on the winning team destruction. Greg, you 161. Yeah, what were you doing? You know who was too? George Washington. But he came back. George Washington was a very skilled Smash.

He not, he's actually really different than Lucario. Floaty. He's more floaty. You just said before other fight that he was like Lucario. So okay, it gets complicated because Mew was in Melee. Then he was not in Brawl. They made Lucario in Brawl and he played kind similarly to Mewtwo. He wasn't a clone, but he was very similar and now he's a little more different than used to be if that makes sense. There different moves. I don't know what the fuck you just said, little kid. Oh, fuck. No, but you reached that, touched him. Talk. Okay, well, him. Yeah, I don't think you can talk and play at the same time, bro. Good. Oh, you know, you had me. Nobody has.

Yeah, Tim, I don't know if you noticed this or not, but you're supposed to win win this shit. Tim can't handle the pressure when I don't like this. Oh, fuck. I'm losing myself here. You got to lose yourself in the music. Oh, fuck. You better never let him go. You only get one, Tim. This is not a chance. Oh, hey, Nick, hate you. Hate you so much. You your stupid little shit. You know, do that again and I'm going to fuck knock you out in real life. Tim, get off me, bro. Tim, Tim, I get Nick. Okay, then, is it bother you that I'm just probably going to win because I'm just over here doing this? I hate this so much. Does it bother you that you're no longer playing?

And uh, I remember this when right before Brawl came out, I imported it from Japan. So I had pretty powerful. And then me and Kieran went to go do a tournament before the game came out in America. And we just fuck wrecked shop 'cause no one had played the game yet. And we just, he played as Meta Knight and played as Ike. And no one knew how to fuck like deal with them. So that was great. But then when we were in lined for that tournament, there was this guy that was pretty good that hadn't played. It was this Asian dude named Simon. No, there this hot girlfriend. And they uh, came over to my house after. I was like, dude, I got the game if you want to come play it. And then he showed us him playing as Mewtwo in Melee. And it was like unreal. Correct. Jesus.",

Now, do you know why he's named? Yes. Did you see we just backward? Why why do you think it is? Correct. I think when the designer or was like developer or the cartoonist, I'm not really sure where Pok\u00e9mon starts, was like, hey, we're going to put this new character in. And somebody's like, what's his name? And he went, Mew, Mew. And so they simplified Mewtwo. Why is it more simple? It seems more complicated. It's kind of like that, but it's different. So remember when um, what what's that guy's name? R. Kelly. Oh, yeah, released the the hit single, \"Ignition (Remix)\". Yeah, but he did that. He did it before came out. And that was weird.

It's like, why would you release the remix first? Sure. It's similar to that. Did he ever release what is that attack? Yeah, he did. It's a drastically different song. Interesting. Um, so Mewtwo is Pok\u00e9mon number 150 and Mew is 151. You didn't come till later. Interesting. So it's kind of weird if you think about it. It's like Mew once get on the do, but he's a Pok\u00e9mon over there. Well, you're beating me so well. That was more through attrition. Now that we actually have to fight each other. I mean, I really want Colin to win. I'm not going to win now that attitude. I'm definitely not going to win. It's like George Washington. 'Cause if Colin wins this, I can mess up one more time.

I don't give him my shot. But I want you guys to know my heart's not in this. So if I win, that's even worse for Tim. 'Cause you know he practiced with Mewtwo like all last night. Of course he did.
