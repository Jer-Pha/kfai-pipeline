And for the record, I was on my phone in the last topic because I was booking Trevor's cab to get him here for the Gamescast. What are you gonna say? What are you going to do? How you, I already said, I already said, I already said it's because you're rude. I said it already. Uh, Greg , what I'm, oh, that's not nice. What I'm really into is, uh, a lot of things, but, uh, etymology is really interesting to me. Not necessarily about words, but about where, that's when you cook marijuana into, into, into food, precisely. That's infology. Oh, okay. Ed, edibles. That's where etymology. Now, one of the things that I was talking about with , uh, Troy Baker at the live show was our, our shared love of etymology, our shared love of where things come from, like words and sayings. And he taught me where the term Green Room comes from, which I didn't know. I didn't know what is. And when we were in the Green Room, he taught it to me. So back in like the,",

So back in like the Middle Ages or even, even in the, maybe or even in the, even in the Renaissance, everyone smelled bad, you know, like every, there was no, there was no deodorant. Yeah, there was just, it was, it was different in terms of, you know, grooming and stuff like that. Every like, so at plays, when actors would be getting dressed and undressed, they'd smell like, and to get rid of the smell or whatever, they'd put like green herbs down on the ground that when you'd step on them, it would like, or leash like Aroma, express it, whatever. And that's where the term Green Room comes from. That's interesting. Um, so I was thinking about that and I'm like, well, there are a bunch of sayings that we use but don't know what they mean, what they really mean, like throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Um, and so I'll start with one that I know and I want, I'll just name, we'll just go as long as we want. I mean, it doesn't really matter. Real quick, I want, I want to give a shout out. Earlier I mentioned Flula is the German dude in Pitch Perfect that I was talking about. His whole thing is his YouTube channel is etymology or is like, it'll be like random phrases like this. Oh, so you're going to be good at this. It's just, well, no, no, but what he does is he like, like a hot mess, but like he'll do like the German version. He's like a heated mess. Why, why?

And that was fun. So yes, I, I didn't get any of them correct. Are you ready? Got it. Yeah, I'm ready. Let's rock. And I watched that video. It's very good by the way. Very good idea. Um, I'm gonna start with one that I know that the world and again, this, this story is by Adam Ellis over at BuzzFeed in case you want to look it up. I know what this one is because Ryan Getz has taught me this and I didn't know this. Do we, does anyone know what don't look a gift horse in a mouse mean mouth means? I heard you guys talking about this so you know it already. So I do know about this. Tim, do you know what? I've never even heard that. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

A gift horse, never look a gift horse in the mouth. When someone gives you something, you're like, what is it? You're like, or like if I were like, I'm going to give this phone, you're like, it's not a, it's not the iPhone 6 Plus. And then you say, don't look good, GI, don't look GI hor in the mouth. You never heard that saying before ? You know what it mean? I've heard it. I don't know. I don't know the, I, I don't have to look at this. The, this one I know thanks to Ryan Gettis who now works at CCP. Troy also talked about it the other night. Yeah, no, you were talking about it's Troy that's, yeah. Um, back in the day, you know, horses would be exchanged or whatever, you'd buy a horse and if someone give gave you a horse typic, if you bought a horse for instance, the first thing you do is look at its mouth and its teeth because as it's, as it got older, its",

But the term don't look at gift horse in the mouth means that if someone just gives you a horse, don't look at it in the mouth. Like they're giving you the horse, it's rude. So that's like where it comes from. Like to do that, you'd be like, you'd basically be insulting someone saying like, you're giv think it's a weird way to say they Gift Horse . Like if I gave you, but the saying's hundreds of years old. That's the point. A lot of these are. This is when horses were still around. Don't exist anymore. Oh, that, that's the point of confusion.

So you ready for this? So let's do a few of these, shall we? Man, Kevin, let the cat out of the bag. Oh, so I think that is because there used to be a world famous cat burglar who would steal cats from people and sell them on the black market and then someone finally found him and was like, Hey, I know who you are, you better let all those cats out of the bag or else I'm telling on you. Is it close? Okay, cats are crazy. That's what you think. That's what you think. Elaborate thing. I was trying to be clever. You bet you get a laugh with cat, you put a cats in the crazy bag. Come on. So, so in, in common etymology or common, uh, you know, usage, letting the cat out of the bag means like letting a secret go, letting the secret or the cat out of the bag, right? Exactly. And in the story it says meaning to reveal a secret, letting the cat out of the bag find",

And in the story it says meaning to reveal a secret, letting the cat out of the bag find its roots in 18th century Street fraud. Suckling pigs were often sold in bags and a popular scheme was to replace the pig with a cat and sell it to an unwitting victim. Interesting, right? Yeah, interesting. All right, here's another one. You're pulling my leg. So of course, pulling my leg today means you're joking, you're joking or you're like, you're with me. Yeah, comes from the Zeppelin days when they laid UNM the Zeppelin to let it go. Sometimes some people would hold on to grab the guy's leg as he went, he'd be like, there were still more and then I was like, wait, it was never tied to my leg just it was just Jones down there, Jonesy taking my leg, pulling my leg.

That's what you think it is. That's a good one. That's a good one too. That's a good one too. Good answer. It's like, it's like we're going to nail one of according to this story it says meaning to tease someone or jokingly lie to them pulling one's leg actually as Sinister Origins rooted in the criminal world of the 18th century Street thieves would literally pull victims down by their leg in order to more easily Rob them.

I just want you guys to realize get sick lot lot of people get sick e go on the Gravitron you get sick that happened to me happened to all of how about can't hold a candle too. So that means like you can't compare or you can't like that one this doesn't compare this doesn't hold this one I would say the realistic answer is that back in the day when they were selling stuff or trading stuff you'd bring a you'd bring a candle to it and it would you'd be like oh well this one isn't authentic so you can't hold a candle to it yeah that would be my good I mean it has to have something to do with candle light as in didn't use to be electricity so you would need candles to illuminate the flaws and something sure before electricity workers needed a",
