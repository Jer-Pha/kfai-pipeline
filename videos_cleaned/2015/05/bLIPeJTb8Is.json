All right, so my topic is is a little bit interesting. I don't think Colin said one thing that's not like it wasn't pertaining to his glasses this entire time so far. Well, was yeah, it was just the glasses that he just said help. All right, my topic. So I had this girlfriend and she does not play video games, period. MH. Never has, never will. Not her thing.

See, you said that when you started dating her that doesn't make a goddamn wick of sense. It doesn't to us. How does a human being in 2015 not know that video games are something people do when you're just in a different group of people that like just doesn't do that? But I mean, you look through the **** ads, right? You see a TV commercial, you see a TV show. It's not like video games are still hidden away some. It's it's the same with us. We're so immersed in it. Like imagine if you like, you know, Kevin and I are very, very, very deep into the climbing community.

That's dis you know about that. You're gross. That's your lifestyle. What does that even mean? I don't know. She likes it. Well, cupcakes are like a treat, super soft and moist and they taste good when you put them in your mouth. You always want another one afterward.

So my question here is like, it really made me think because it's like, you know, I'm not trying to force games on anybody and like I I don't want to force my interest upon people, but I was really kind of thinking philosophically like what games could I show my mom? It's like someone that's never played video games ever. My mom, you know, knows they exist, but like has never played one. MH. If I were to show her a game, what would I show her? Because you know, like we we think, oh, Mario Bros., you think like all these these classic games or whatever, but it's like I don't think that they they'd wrap their head around.

Like should is it an artsy thing like a Journey or is it something that's more of just like a this is a a representation of what a video game is, you know, or something like an Uncharted that's more like you like movies, right? See, I think you go Uncharted. That's the problem is they're going to be confused by it. I'm like, I don't you know, you put a controller in someone's hand for the first time. It's never played uh like a third person perspective shooter like that and they're going to be like, I don't they don't know their muscle memory is just it's not going to be for you know, and I wasn't reading your question as having them play because I think that's an important.

I don't know. What are you guys' thoughts? I mean, so I'm starting with your girlfriend. Okay, me and her are alone in your house. Yes. Are are they wearing pants? Um, she is Daisy Dukes. She is. I'm in Daisy Dukes. He's in Colin in Daisy Dukes. I turned off the lights and I put on The Last of Us. Okay, yeah, because I think that's got the most emotional punch from the J Jump and then you can get into the mechanics of how it works. I don't have her play it.

I think this this always comes back to my argument with like trying to explain to the old people in Congress who I need to die what video games are. Be careful saying that because they always talk. I always bring up the fact that you like the reason they get all bent out of shape about video game violence is because they still their one time with video games was their daughter playing Super Mario Brothers on the NES and then she went on to another interest, never played video games. So now they hear you kill a hooker in Grand Theft Auto and take back the money. They assume it's a seven-year-old sitting you cross-legged in front of the TV playing something like Mario and that blows their mind. So to start",

So to start with them or anybody on that end of the spectrum, I'd show them how far it's come as a medium and a storytelling medium and that's why I pick The Last of Us. Damn, that was quite platform Colin. I think starting with something like Mario makes a lot of sense. I mean, my my whole thing has always been like, I don't want to be in a relationship with a girl that plays video games. It's never been interesting to me. It's like something I want to avoid. Um, and mostly it's because I don't want to date myself. So like this has often been a problem that I've had to overcome in various wily ways. Um, do wily ways. So like if you want to be like, I think The Last of Us is a good a good choice if like, and I don't mean it a negative connotation, if you want to be kind of pretentious in the sense that's it's like this is what a video",

Isn't it so legit? Like, but if that's not really your interest, then like, I think there's nothing wrong with going back to River Raid or Mario or something like that and being like, you know, understanding the fundamental of gameplay, um, as a video game medium because storytelling was not important in games, um, for a very long time. And so, um, the fundamental aspect of playing a video game is still playing a video game. And so I I I don't, you know, I don't necessarily know that, you know, I've showed people The Last of Us in that sense and that pretentious like, look how **** awesome this is. But I would probably go back to something simpler, something without dual sticks and um, um, you know, something on you know, 2D plane and stuff like that. Well,",

Well, so do when you say Mario, like, do you think it would be a 2D one like like Mario Bros. or would it be something more like a Galaxy? I mean, assuming that the the person, the girl in question is has been under a rock forever and has never seen a Mario game, then it makes the most sense to start with a 2D side-scroller. So I think the original Mario was still a master class of gaming as we've talked about gameplay and stuff like that. It's just that, you know, I've never been in a relationship with a girl that's played game. So I've I've never had to not deal with this problem in some sense. So I have like, and it's not to say I would never date, I guess, a girl that plays games. It's just that like, that's not I don't really want that, you know?

Um, someone that can like bring in different things and show me and teach me different things and has different interests, you know? Um, and so you have to kind of you have to look at it from both points of view where it's like you have to kind of synergize like the whole, well, this is what I do and this is what you do. And so let me learn something from you and I'll teach you something about what I do if you're interested. But I I would love to, you know? Um, I just want time time to play my games and and that requires like the other person relationship having lots of interests that or whatever they are.

I don't think The Last of Us shows what like The Last of Us is profoundly fun to play, but I don't think that's immediately obvious to someone that doesn't know anything about video games. I don't think they'd understand the first thing about playing that game. And so I think that you have to start simple and start with like the fundamental aspect of enjoyment. And with that, you go back to like Atari 2600, NES. I pretty easily. Yeah, see, I disagree, but I think it's because we're coming at the problem from two different things. I'm not trying to get somebody to play video games. I'm trying to get them to understand why I play video games. And so I feel like jumping in and showing a Mario doesn't solve the problem of, well, that's simple, that looks like a baby's toy. Like you've seen",

Like you've seen Mario even though your girlfriend didn't understand video games are something adults do. She's seen Mario at some point. And again, that's probably where her education stopped. Simple pixels going through and doing this thing. She doesn't want to sit down and play it. She doesn't want to get invested in and see, you know what I mean? Like that's the hard part. Like I can I'm not going to jump in and show them DC Universe Online, right? And be like, I spent 600 hours in this and I sometimes I just fly around and collect exobytes. What? Let's do that for, you know, I mean, no, that doesn't work. That doesn't make any sense. Like it's a slippery slope. What do you think about a game like Journey where it's a shorter experience and it it's essentially a very simple game? Sure. I but I don't think it plays in either",

If you give them the controller and have them play that, they're frustrated because they don't understand I think how to make him move, what to do. And they don't understand some of the interesting what's some of the fascinating parts of Journey are the limitations of Journey. Like, you know what I mean? Like to us, it's like, oh man, I can only do this. I can only move this way. That's interesting. How do I figure out this jumping system and the floating and everything else? So I think if they play it, they get not frustrated, but they're like, I just don't get what's happening. Why is this interesting? And then if they watch it, I think they get bored because they don't understand the nuance of what you're doing. Journey is also a Gamers game, I think. Yeah, like the to me, I'm",

Yeah, like the to me, I'm sorry to interrupt because I know you to chime. It's just I don't know. I think it's just fundamentally important that we, you know, if people are exposed to games, you have to do it in a way that makes the most sense at the most rudimentary at the most rudimentary level possible. Like, you know, again, like I've had, you know, girlfriends that have not been interested in games at all and then become interested in just learning about them, never interested in really playing them, which is which is ideal because I I hate myself enough that I don't want to date myself, you know? So, um, so that that's, you know, that's a good place to start. So again, I just, you know, you have to The Last of Us is a game I show to people to impress them.

You almost have to start like at almost like a pinball mentality where it's like we're playing the idea of playing a game. The the pastime of playing a game is having a control in your hand and controlling what's on the screen regardless of like what the genre is or how it looks or what console you're playing. So I think you can go in a lot of different directions, but, you know, I would go with what the games that are just the most fun, you know? Um, because that's why we all started playing games. We didn't all start playing games because we thought they told good stories or like that they were pretty to look at. That might be attractive to you when you're flipping through Nintendo Power, your instruction manual, but we didn't start playing games for",

We got addicted to Kid Icarus and Mega Man and Castlevania and all that **** when we were kids because they were **** fun. And then we read more into them and then games expanded and evolved from there. So I always think you should start from the very beginning. It reminds me of how my mom used to tell me that like when before I was born, my brother had an Atari 2600 and we had one when I was growing up, but she used to when Dan would go to to um to school, she would just play um Frogger like all day and and uh she a master at it. Yeah, and she was apparently like nasty Ro is burning everything's in. She had like some sort of exposure to video games and never really wanted to go back either.

I've shown Cheryl like many games and she doesn't she she's interested and she she's engaged, but she doesn't really care. And she loves Super Stacker. But that's kind of part of why we get along. Like it's because like she's not me. So it's like there's that other ancillary aspect of like balancing the relationship. I've always been more interested in learning something new from someone I was dating as opposed to like getting get just it being like me like dating me, you know? So it's almost I almost like that the girls I date personally don't care about games because it frees me up from having to always do that, you know?

So yeah, I'm in the same boat with Colin is that I think that, you know, I struggle with that as well with S where I I am now more and more turning on Netflix or turning on the TV and going, Jesus, there is literally nothing on. And when I say nothing, I mean like everything just seems exactly the same as the thing that came right before, right? All the reality shows that are on are exactly the same. Um, everything that's being told. I know everyone's like, oh, TV is amazing right now.

I do that a lot too. Literally the day I went back and I was like, I I tried to find a movie that had been removed from my list like months ago because that's how long I ago I put it on and then it just ran out the license ran out. But more and more I'm thinking I go, oh, you know, like it's awesome because now I have to do Netflix through my PlayStation 4.

It's like, it's not going to happen. I was playing it till o'clock in the morning last night. Um, but I think for me, the importance is not necessarily the game, but what game is going to get them to your significant other or person who doesn't play video games to realize that it is a great and healthy option too, which most people view television is in in this weird light where when you're watching, think you're actually being like, I don't know if you're being productive, but you're getting something that you feel is of great value or when they look at video games, they think maybe that's just a child's toy or it's not specifically uh I don't know something",

It's a very active experience and it's something that I think is a lot more gratifying in most instances than just watching the 14th iteration of Real Housewives. Um, not to say that that shows bad. God know God knows I watch thousands of hours of that, especially one when they're in Melbourne. But um, my wife is slowly starting to come around to the idea that I play games. Getting her to play games would be a feat that I I just don't think I could do. Although she blew my mind the other day when she was like, hey, that game you're playing looks a lot like a game I used to love. And I think she said Mario Land on on the Game Boy Game Boy Color.

And to me, I think the the games that I've come down to are Mario, whether it's Mario World. I think I'd go with World. Mario Galaxy. I was thinking Journey, but I agree with you just in the sense that it is a condensed experience. And um, The Last of Us. But then the other one is just Pok\u00e9mon.

It just more I was just thinking about like people that because yeah, like it's this topic went a little bit more about like relationship stuff. But it's like, uh, I I really just mean it more just like if you haven't played a video game, like where's a good place to start? Yeah, you know, um, Pok\u00e9mon's I'm sorry. I was just going to say Pok\u00e9mon's interesting because and I don't mean this in a in a pejorative way because I played most of the Pok\u00e9mon games, but it really is it is really baby's first role playing. So it's like, so I mean that really is what it is. I mean, I hate to say it. So it's because it's just it's easy and it can be as deep as you want it to",
