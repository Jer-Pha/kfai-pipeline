      "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome back to Kinda Funny Games. My name is Colin Moriarty, this is Nick Scarpino. Nick, we're here to play one of my favorite games of the last few years. I'm digging it, man. It's a game, oh, you see what I did there? You beat me to it. It's a game called Shovel Knight. Shovel Knight, Shovel Knight came to Wii U, 3DS, and PC last year, that was 2014. Now it's available on PS3, PS4, PS Vita, and Xbox One and you can get in all those places. You should play it as much as you possibly can. I really love this game. I thought we would jump in since you and I have kind of the old school uh uh love here as a war. Uh so we'll create a character. Let's name him uh Galvat ron uh just for old time sake. And then let's see here, is there something you need to say? No, I was going to say I'm I'm excited about this game too. This is one of those games where just like Axiom Verge where you sort of talked about it and I'm like, you know what? I'm going to take Colin's advice, I'm going to play it. So I've",

I'm going to take Colin's advice, I'm going to play it. So I've been playing through Shovel Knight, it's a blast. This game is this game is fun. Now the cool thing about this game, this game is by a studio called Yacht Club. Uh odd name for a game studio. Yeah, it's pretty awesome. Uh this is their first game. They kickstarted it when I was at IGN, I actually exclusively revealed the game to the world and and uh people really took to it. Um some of the guys that are at Yacht Club used to work at Way Forward. Way Forward of course is known very well in the industry for making a lot of old school kind of games. The one of the most recent games they made for instance was Duck Tales remastered, right? Um so there's a lot of good pedigree at that studio. These guys understand 8bit games, they understand um how to make them, how to how to draw them, how to make it sound like an epic",

And so we're watching the intro right now. Um poor Shovel Knight um living a life of solitude right after his beloved Shield Knight disappeared and this is of course uh the Order of No Quarter. So these are basic so the game is heavily inspired by Mega Man but not only Mega Man as we'll see and this is really where it's inspired by Mega Man, eight bosses that are all Knights, so not men but Knights, right? And they all have like a little special ability and stuff like that. And so Sh ovel Knight's about to go out um into the world. This this intro reminds me a great deal Mega Man 4's intro or say uh maybe a little bit of Castlevania 3's intro. Um some cool stuff here.

So I've played a little bit. So I'm I'm not going to rush through it. I'm used to I just got the platinum trophy in the game and so I'm used to just running through the game at this point. I beat it like five times like literally uh so I'm going to actually try to play it a little more organically here. Let me ask you a question, did you repeat this level like over and over and over again to grind uh uh money? No, I never found I I got to be honest with you, I never found the need to grind for money except if you're going to get the 50,000 gold at one time trophy, you have to have 50,000 gold in your in your at one time and to do that you have be kind of dough especially because you lose it if you die.

Yeah, that's the thing that kills me is that it's not just as easy as grabbing the jewels like I'm like oh this is awesome. I already have like you know 500 gold coins or Jewels whatever the currency is um and then you die and you have to go back and get it like it just pops out of your body and you got to go back and get it. It adds an extra little uh little bit of depth to the game. It does and I and I would say that it even adds a little bit of ease to the game. I think that the the one complaint I have with Shovel Knight for as hard as people find the game, I don't think it's really that hard. Um is uh especially by the standards of the games that it is inspired by um is that I think that the game doesn't have quite as much consequence for dying.

So like when you know in the first stage you get the ability to upgrade your life and your and your magic um and then you know the second level you're able to kind of upgrade your armor but they're pretty smart about it and that you can't just it's not for uh for the shovel you have three upgrades but for the armor you can only pick one armor have in a given time so you have to be a little strategic",

So the the attack you know the attack mechanic you get a projectile attack later on if you want it if you have full health it's very much like Zelda for instance um that's the one where you like charge and go I don't find that uh all that usable though. Well this is the one I don't know if we're talking about the same thing. I'm talking about the one where if you have full health and you shoot it shoots a thing across the ground. Oh no I haven't gotten that yet. So that's like very much like the the master sword Zelda, the Pogo stick obviously the Pogo attack as we said is from DuckTales, the mini bosses really could be from any sort of game.
