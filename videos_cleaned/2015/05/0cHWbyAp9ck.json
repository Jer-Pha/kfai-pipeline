I picked everything alphabetical order. You're you're a human computer. Yeah, yeah, well, not really . Well, close enough. Uh, Scott says any games/genres you wish you were better at? What's what a weakness in your gaming repertoire that you wish you were better at? Colin, fighting games. Yeah, that's definitely a weakness for me, too. I don't know that it was necessarily identified for me as a weakness until I moved here. I thought I was pretty good at fighting games. Yeah, um, cuz you cleaned up with your friends back in New York. Yeah, I used to. I was, and I still think I'm a pretty competent like Street Fighter player, for instance, but like I never was introduced to this next level, like not casual or highend casual play until I came to California, California. And I remember playing Mark Ryan and and other people and being like, I'm not good at",

And I remember playing Mark Ryan and and other people and being like, I'm not good at this game at all. The way I play it doesn't make any sense. I don't explore the control. Like I play as Ken in Street Fighter, um, and I use only Fierce punch and fierce kick and and I jump a lot, which exposes me a lot, but I like doing that because you get around the screen faster and stuff. That like I can't play like that with like real people. I get destroyed. Yeah, and I'm and I was so interested in, you know, especially way Mark Ryan and I JM played where, you know, you use like the the Jabs and all these kinds of things. You set up like these combos by like breaking blocks and and you know, analyzing frames and exposing enemies in in different ways or whatever or your opponents in different ways. And it's like, man, I didn't play these games like this. Um, and I played a lot of fighting G. I played a lot",

I played a lot of fighting games, you know, I played a lot of the SNK fighting games and obviously, um, you know, Street Fighter and then a little bit of Mortal Kombat, although I think I never really liked Mortal Kombat. Um, but then, you know, Street Fighter versus X-Men or X-Men versus Street Fighter and sure, I I mean, I loved all these games and I thought I was confident at them, but I'm not, you know, Street Fighter Alpha 3 is probably like my favorite fighting game ever. I love that game. Yeah, um, on PS 1, but excuse me, some of these people just play these games that sure that just and not even competitively. There's some people that aren't competitive scen at all that just play at a much higher level. So right, right. For me, I mean, like the first thing that jumps to mind is first person shooters.

Like I'm competent in first person shooters now , like, and I'm talking about like multiplayer, jumping in and playing something multiplayer, right? Because when Titanfall was coming up, Alfredo put me through a boot camp to get me decent and I was decent and when Titanfall came out, I hung in there in my month and a half of playing. I hung in there and was like usually in the mid to upper part of the rankings, right? I was doing all right for somebody who hadn't really been into it. But like now I'd go back for sure and get killed. It just works on a different level for the kids who have grown up with that, right? Cuz for us it was like in High School playing Golden Eye, right?

So I was never like playing competitive shooters that way. And so it's just a weakness I feel in my thing of like I can't talk to Bobby or another Call of Duty player, Alfredo or even Destiny people really, right? When it gets out of the mechanics of shooting and like aiming on the sights and doing all these different things and knowing how to assess threats and get head shot easier and da da. I play games and I have fun with them, right? And I I like for Titanfall, I invest a lot of time into to get good at it, but I'm not great at it out of the box. I wish I was better just out of the box at, you know, yeah, multiplayer Shooters are interesting. I I I I actually feel like I'm a really competent shooter player, but I don't play online.

I'm like, I'm gonna actually destroy everything in this room right now because this game is impossible. Yeah, I can't believe anyone beat that game on veteran. I I like I it's one of those frustrating moments where like I I accept that I I didn't beat Battletoads. No One Beat Battletoads. I still don't think anyone ever beat Battletoads.
