I feel like Kevin for you know, Kevin doesn't move quickly , but he moves at a normal speed, but I feel like the in the directions in which he falls and stumbles indicates that he has incredible inertia. Like like Kevin's a body that's always in movement, you know what I mean? And he don't forget he did beat Shan finnean in a foot race at IGN before we left. So yeah, something about that's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then without fail, he'll trip on it and it'll pull the headphones, it'll pull everything. And I don't know if you guys notice this, but he always takes his headphones and like puts him on the side of the table and it's just like Kevin, don't do that because you **** knock him over.

Kevin can use a soundboard, he can use a camera, but he falls a lot. I can catch things in the air using my go tending prowess , but you wouldn't find me editing a video. True. You understand Kevin?

Is this a unique thing and is this just a nice little like is this the future of retro revivals? Like we've seen a lot of the 8 bit, we've seen a lot of the 16 bit.

But I'm trying not to hold my just never caring, you know, my un bash uncaring of Banjo Kazooie against this game cuz if they were to say not Naughty Dog or whatever, but if somebody was to make another Jack and Daxter, right?

Like it's not doing anything for me when when uh Nuts and Bolts came out and everyone at IGN tried to convince himself that was a great game. I was like I this isn't I don't like this. What are you talking about brv? You know what I mean? Like that wasn't a thing for me and it's just not a franchise that speaks to me. So I don't want to hold it against this, but like is the era of these games over or whatever? Like it's been gone a while. I feel like you haven't seen anybody come out and really commit to this in a long time. That's interesting. I'm interested to see what happens in this genre. I mean, what was the the last one?

So I don't have the love of that era of Rare games that other people do and I appreciate that people you know, and that's not NE I like D7 and stuff, but you know, there's that portion of Rare's history is something that people very fondly remember.
