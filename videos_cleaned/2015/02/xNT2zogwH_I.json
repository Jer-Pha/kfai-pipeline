      "text": "What's up guys, I'm Tim Gettys. I'm here with World Series Champion, Kinda Funny family, and Mortal Kombat super fan, Hunter Pence. That's me. What's up? So we just got to play some Mortal Kombat X. Does it feel like Mortal Kombat? I mean, what a question. It is Mortal Kombat. It's Mortal Kombat X. It's pretty rad to to jump into all the characters from, you know, my youth that I grew up with. You know, the ones that they've announced. There's there's a lot of them. There's some new ones, which is cool too, to throw a new twist. Mm-hm. But to jump into Scorpion, Sub Zero. You know, to see the daughter of Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade, it's it's just a-Cassie Cage. Yeah, Cassie Cage. Mm-hm. But it's the daughter them two, so it's it's pretty crazy and it definitely feels it's got the blood, it's got the gore that you remember as a kid and kind of on a whole new level. Mm-hm. So, her specifically, she actually has",

So, her specifically, she actually has different fighting styles and all of the characters have. The body style variation. So on the character select screen, you can choose. Yeah. Between three variations. And it's not. They don't all have the standard of things. Where it's not just the the defensive or offensive or whatever. Each character has things that are tailored to them. And Cassie specifically has one. That's a little more Sonya, or one that's a little more Johnny Cage, or one that's a little more in in between. What did you think about the different variations for the characters you play? Yeah, I mean, that's that a pretty you the unique dynamic to add. You know, because a lot of times you fall in love with the character, you're like I love you know, Scorpio or I",

      "text": "you run into like this horrible counter. Ugh, I have to do one as a zoner, I can't do anything. Or if anyone's in your face, you can't do anything. Well now, each character has 3 different styles. So say, if one spell is weaker against , you know, say a zoner or someone's weaker upfront. Or you want to be fast, or you want to be powerful, or whatever the case may be. They all have 3 different things, so. It allows your mind more creativity and it allows you to really love your character and to to learn and and I guess just go in. Mm-hm. With as much as you can and it also makes it where you can keep it fresh. And you can keep it fresh with everyone, so I think. More options make the game more fun and this is a really cool thing that they've",

Yeah, and another option you got to do was the game mode called Living Towers, which is the new challenge mode of this game . Where you kind of go up the tower and there's the three different ones. There's the quick, which is kind of you got to do. And then there's the daily ones, which are new ones everyday. And then there's the premier ones, which are more themed. So it'll be like holiday specific ones or based on specific Mortal Kombat events and all that stuff. We did a little bit of the daily challenges. What do you think about that? Yeah, I it's it's definitely new and I think anyone that's played Mortal Kombat from from back in the day, you remember the towers. You remember working your way up.

You're like, you know, you're running through the matches with like bombs being dropped and it could hit anybody , or lasers going across the screen. So. They've thrown some curve balls that we haven't seen before. They give you a lot of opportunities to find the way that you enjoy the game and I think it's definitely like a cool addition to a to Mortal Kombat. The coolest thing I think we saw today was the Faction War. Which is this new thing where it's online and its ever present between no matter what version your playing or which console and that's a. And you play you choose one of the five",

What did you think about that? Yeah, so to me, I think a lot of people and and I've always loved fighting games. And I think most games one of the coolest things beyond just like making yourself a better player and enjoying the skill and the competition. It feels good to be playing and earning something. It feels good you know, to be building up whatever status and to have whatever icon or to to just have a cause behind it other than just, you know, increasing your skill or beating someone. That's just for you. So, with this it allows team matches. It allows you to like create friends throughout your factions. Like hey, let's go out, let's challenge",

They have a couple unique concepts with that in in in store and you're you're as you're playing your games and you're enjoying, you know, playing and getting better and having your fun, you're also, you know, you feel like you're gaining something. Yeah So, I think that that is is a special addition to this game as well. That just kind of gives you more gratification to to winning, to playing and win, lose or draw like when you're going in you're gaining something. So you feel better as you're playing. Yeah. And you feel really rewarded. I like that. Yeah and it's cool too that it's single player or multiplayer. Yeah. You can do team battles with your friends where there's like five on five men. Where it's five one on one matches happening at the same time. Yeah.",

Cuz we didn't really get into the details about that. But to me. Mm-hm. I think yeah, however you like to play the game you're gonna helping your faction, you're gonna be gaining points. Mm-hm. And you know, ultimately making yourself sweet while you're playing. Yeah. Thanks a lot. Alright. Thank you Tim. You guys. I'm sure you are very excited about Mortal Kombat X.
