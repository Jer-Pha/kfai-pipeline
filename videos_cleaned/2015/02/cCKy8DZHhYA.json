You always say 'Scarpino', so I think I'm just trying to do that. Okay, also I just think I got a dumb fat tongue that doesn't know where to go anymore. Like we're going to have to make a new shirt for that, the producer/shoer. Shoer? What's a shoer? Anyways, that's the pure one. Tim Gettys, hi. Let Tim host. Pride of Long Island, Colin Moriarty.

I remember it was right, yeah, right under the Reddit. That was a big deal, viral. Those were the very early days of Up at Noon. People didn't know what to make of that show. And it was also, that was when we did the debut trailer for The Walking Dead, wasn't it? The Telltale Game. Yeah, the first time I came on, I think I, I had brought the trailer with me and that was like one of the biggest Up at Noon episodes we ever did. Yeah, it was huge 'cause we lied to everybody and said, 'You're going to get to see the gameplay for the first time.' And there was like seconds in the trailer of gameplay.

And I was, yeah, video game journalist for about 12 years from '88 to around 2000, something like that. Then you realize there's no money in that. You abandon ship. You just decide on a whim one weekend on a cocktail napkin. You write this screenplay for The Book of Eli. Takes off. Denzel Washington's next to you, sees the screenplay and is like, 'I'm in.

So, um, you know, it's, it's, it's another tier, I think, in this whole wave of whether it be Kickstarter or Indiegogo or Patreon. You know, people just able to kind of get rid of the, the, the Gatekeepers that usually stand between people that make things and people that want to read and watch and listen to things are kind of going away because in this internet age, you know, you can just talk directly to an audience, say, 'Would you like to read this?'

And five minutes later, my publisher was texting me going, 'What just happened?' Because the traffic on the website just went through the roof. And there's like five times as many people as before order the book. And that's the power of Felicia Day. Yeah, yeah, we know it. We know it. Well, I like that Felicia Day.

And I discovered years later in a magazine that what that credit meant was that Atari just built the dummy cabinet. Okay, so based on it, it wasn't a real, it wasn't a real thing. But Atari made it look like a real game, a real machine. And so I was, I love that. I love, I love, love, love that movie.

Yeah, um, but it was the first thing that looked like really kind of amazingly computer generated. And it's just a great story. I mean, I honestly, this is going to sound like a silly thing to say, but I honestly put it in the same category as something like Star Wars, where it's like, you know, as a young kid, think about it, right? So Alex Rogan is Luke Skywalker. He's a young kid living somewhere in the middle of nowhere, feels like no, nothing's going to happen in his life. He dreams of like being more and doing more, but he's never going to get out of this backwards town where he lives. And, and then",

And, and then suddenly, here comes this interesting character from far away, this enigmatic character who says, will come with me on an adventure in outer space. So I'm at this point describing the story of both Star Wars and The Last Starfighter. And he goes and has this amazing adventure and saves the Galaxy. Like, you know, all the great stories come from the same basic ingredients. And Starfighter, I think, has those ingredients. And just as a kid, like, you just, there's a great video on YouTube called the Spielberg Face. I don't know if you ever seen this. Every, every classic era Spielberg film has it. E.T. has it. Um, Raiders of the Lost Ark has it. At some point, you have a, there's a moment where the character just goes like this, because there's something happening that is so amazing, you're just awed.

And so years and years later, me, like, it's every time screenwriters get together and talk, the story comes up, Last Starfighter. How the fuck are we going to do it? And every single screenwriter desperately, I guarantee you, if that went out tomorrow, tomorrow, Warner Bros. or whoever now has the, the rights to The Last Starfighter, wants to remake it.

We so desperately want to do a new version to inspire kids today in the same way that we were inspired by it when we in the 1980s. But the rights are just tied up in so much impossible red tape. I've heard a million stories. Spielberg's tried to do it. Seth Rogen has tried to make a, and they've all, and none of them have gotten anywhere. And so I don't know what the deal is with the rights, but they're just stuck in a box somewhere that no one can open. And it's incredibly frustrating to everyone because we all want to do it.

I did a lot of reading about the original J. W. Rinzler wrote these amazing books about the, about the making of the original trilogy and how the films were received when they first came out. And there was all this tremendous anticipation for Empire.

Um, bunch of racists. Jesus. Starting to see your point. It's a, it's a fun, fairly light-hearted movie that ends on a triumphant note.

Yeah, you have the luxury of, you know, having often times, if you do like a TV pilot or an origin story movie, there's a certain amount of real estate you have to set aside just to set everyone up. And then when you do the second one, you get to hit the ground running with the, with those characters that you already know. Um, so I guess it kind of had that luxury.
