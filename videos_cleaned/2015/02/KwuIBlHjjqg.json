Um, I thought it would be fun to solicit information from them about what we're doing right, what we're doing wrong, and also kind of just get just general details of who the hell these people are because I'm really curious about, you know, the demographics of the our Patreon supporters and if there's any, you know, themes or anything that we can work towards fixing or or continue to do and whatnot. So we put out a survey for our Patreon supporters that was live for four days last month and uh I guess it was actually earlier this month and so February, yeah, and uh I had some there's some interesting things that I want to share with you guys because you guys don't I've actually been staring at this thing like it's the Matrix for like the last two weeks but you guys have not seen any of any of it so I thought I'd share some of this information with you and this is",

Oh yeah, it's definitely where it's like because it's the goal was like it was a volunteer or whatever. Yeah, it's it's not it's not there's nothing well it's somewhat scientific but I don't know what the uh the I don't know it wasn't a random sample of Patreon users. It was the political science person is coming out a little bit. So gender, not surprisingly, overwhelmingly male. We do have a uh female listenership but the but our male listenership it it creates about 98% of our Patron. Oh wow, 98% yeah, according to this.
