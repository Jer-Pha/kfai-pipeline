Mr. Gary Wood sitting us to touch his knees. Don't touch his knees. We told tou knees. Well, Greg is actually touching my knee at this moment. Never actually . Now you can leave now. After all of that, it wasn't really worth it, was it? What are you talking about? It was worth it . It wasn't for me. Came back. We had fun. I'm glad you got some time. Did it. We were just, we were just two ships in the night and look at us now, lovers. What the hell does that mean? I don't know.

Yeah, and this is an incredible, an incredible thing, right? We are all in some way, shape, or form, I think a Star Wars fan. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and that must be such a great, obviously great honor and as you were saying, you know, it's a great fear and responsibility that comes along with that too because um fear leads to hate though so that that's true. That's a good point. What does hate lead to? No, fear leads to anger and anger leads to I don't write the movies. I just watch them clearly.

And so I was curious uh specifically for you Gary, but also for everyone because we've talked about Star as many times on the show but not really in terms of a film by film basis, what do we think and and and if there's an objective answer even uh and probably not, but what is the best Star Wars movie? The Essential Star Wars movie? And I think that for a lot of people, me included, it's Empire, but what is what is your favorite Star Wars movie and why? Because I'm always interested in hear we always talk in platitudes, oh, Empire is the best, yeah, but why, you know, and why would maybe Jedi or New Hope not be as good as Empire? So Gary, I'm curious if you can talk a little bit about maybe what your favorite or you can just give us intimate details",

I would I would hesitate to to get into an argument about what is the best and my favorite one is Empire and it's not a particularly controversial answer. It is, you know, it's a really good one. Um and I think what I what's really interesting to me about the original Star Wars Trilogy is that it tonally shifts so much from the first to the second film. I did a lot of reading about the original J.W. Rinsler wrote these amazing books about the about the making of the original trilogy and how the films were received when they first came out and there was all this tremendous anticipation for Empire, but when it came out it really threw a lot of people because wait, this is suddenly much look at the tone of the original Star Wars which is really um it's just fun.

I had this, I had to, blows my perception of , of everything moment recently when I was playing, uh, an Xbox game and I was right in the middle of working on Star Wars, so everything was like, I kept seeing Star Wars and everything I was doing even when I was like trying to switch off. And I remember looking down at my Xbox One controller and seeing the four buttons, X, B, Y, and A. And I remember, ****, those are the four kinds of Rebel Fighters, X, B, Y , and A. And it blew, it was like blown my mind, blown for like, that's crazy. I did not realize that either. Yeah, I would have never thought of that. That's, that's super interesting.

And so that's, that was really cool to me is if you look at it, it's , it's basically, it's a great textbook way of how to tell a team story where like you've got other movies that don't do it so well. Um, and now more than ever, it's really important. You've got X-Men, you've got Avengers, you've got all these movies that are coming out now that kind of figured it out that they have to have each of their characters do something pivotal, otherwise it's boring.

But yeah, I mean, like, I remember watching X-Men, the original X-Men movie and it was a good movie, but I remember thinking to myself, why didn't they figure out a slightly smarter way to split these characters up so that they could have achieved sort of different parts of that common goal like Star Wars did. Well, Days of Future Past, they did, they did a better job. They, that actually I think is a better example of sort of how to take a badass character and not make him the focus, just have him sort of be the vehicle, which I, I thought they did a great job with that.

If he's in the movie, he's the most dynamic character, it's going to be about him, but it wasn't about him. It wasn't really his story. He was just sort of like the, the vessel if you will, to kind of tell that story. Seven movies for it not to be. I mean, I, I love that and I love what they did with, with, uh, Wolverine as well, the his Standalone story. Um, but yeah, I loved Jedi when I was a kid because of that, because they had those three planes of action that were happening and they tried to do it, uh, a little bit with Phantom Men ace and it worked.

No, it's a, it's a masterpiece of structure and editing and you realize all the pieces into like, you know, what's happening on the ground is they need to, you know, blow up the bunkers that the **** will come down up in out of space and everything's happening against the backdrop of, you know, is Luke going to turn to the dark side?
