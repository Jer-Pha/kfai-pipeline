I just thought it was like rare he me to. I think that Battletoads keeps coming up like I keep it keeps in dumb little ways and none of them mean anything. But the fact that Battletoads keeps coming up, you know, Banjo-Kazooie, you've been hearing like these things and like this spiritual success all that stuff. But like that's different, you know, I like took a left turn. Battletoads is the one that like, oh, the the music composer is doing something and oh, you know, they're doing this and like, oh, there's a t-shirt. It's like all right, something's happening over here. It's just a weird it's like I just don't understand the relevance of that game today. Like I don't it's so weird. It's very similar",
