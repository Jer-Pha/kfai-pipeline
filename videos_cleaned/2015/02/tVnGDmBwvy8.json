Colin, why are we excited for The Order 1886 alternate history? That's right. And that's why we're so excited teamed up with PlayStation to show you TheOrderGame.com. It's this website with all sorts of Easter eggs and explanations. Let's take a look. All right, Colin. So, the big thing about The Order 1886 when we first found out about it is a little bit of like what is this? What is the order? What are they talking about doing all that? Obviously, the website starts there and starts talking about it, right? What is the order? Uh, the order is a centuries old group of knights um that basically protects humanity from these these half breed uh creatures, right? Which going through this pin board as we're about to. It comes to light pretty quick that the big thing they're focusing on here in fact is the werewolf that that is like",

It comes to light pretty quick that the big thing they're focusing on here in fact is the werewolf that that is like this half creature, right? Basically, what I like about the story and one of the nice alternate history kind of uh split threads in The Order, I think, is the fact that there's a natural evolutionary split in humanity that creates the Lykan type half breed or whatever that's going up against what you would normally see as a human as of 1886 in the story line. Yeah. And that's and we're going to get into all that obviously about who the half breeds are, but I I just like the idea. I I think the fact that the the Knights of the Round Table table never really went away. They didn't dissolve, right? they kind of faded into the background and kept fighting on humanity's hat as the order is a cool idea, right? And I think that, you know, the the hallmark of any good um alternate history, I mean,",

And I think that, you know, the the hallmark of any good um alternate history, I mean, think about , you know, one of our favorites, Resistance, or one of my favorites anyway, about how Resistance has uh it touches on the Tonguska event, which is something that really happened in Russia in the early 1900s, and then splits off from there. You always have to find that really good nugget of real history and in which they split off to make good alternate history. And it's the knights, you know, of the round table, the real round table, King Arthur, um, that they split off from, which I think is really cool because what's so interesting about that specifically is that there's not much in the way of proof that everything we know about the round table and King Arthur really happened. A lot of that is lore. And so it is like a nice little alternate history take on something that might",

And so it is like a nice little alternate history take on something that might already be kind of alter. And what's cool about it with the alternate history angle, right, is the fact that not only take did they take the order the nights that were on a table, they pull it into the industrial revolution. They make a big part of like London. Yeah, that that's what's cool about this website is it's merging histo, you know, history with all the different things here. Cuz here they're talking about industrial revolution, what it means, right? New opportunities. You can expand into art, science, society. But of course down here then it comes down to the fact that like they can actually use this for the first time. They can have, you know, new weapons help give life to the idea of freely. That you could that you could stop these creatures, right? That you could give them",

That you could give them equal footing for the first time ever, if not pull ahead, get get out and, you know, advance on these half breeds that are always after you, right? And this is one of the great angles I think of The Order specifically is that the industrial revolution happens um you know in in real time in the 19th century but it's accelerated in in The Order 18 86 as well so that by the time you get to 1886 in this particular timeline this alternate history timeline they already have zeppelins they have radio wireless radio communication they have all these kinds of things um so it makes it necessary obviously Tesla uh you know a real a real person in the 1 9th century uh you know it it's characterized as them like you said, having the strength to fight the half breeds on an even playing field, but it",

Like you look at a Zeppelin in the air in The Order 1886, you're like, \"Oh, I guess that fits there.\" But in reality , that's decades before the Zeppelin really existed. Uh we're digging through right now, who are the Knights of the Order. Obviously, we've talked about them before round table and all this stuff. What's interesting is Galahan Pival, you start to look at this like are these the you know, the the original knights and it's no, right? I mean the right down here they say like the order uses the names of the original knights as honorary titles which is interesting cuz the whole shtick with the game right is the fact that it could it's possible you'd think that it's you know possible that these people would have lived they could they",

No, but they're using this thing called black water that heals them, right? That's what is that all about? And you see right here I mean this and this is one of the very first things we saw really from The Order was this vial and it's really this this black liquid that comes out of his essential this black water. It gives them a longevity. It lets them fight these centuries long battles with the liykan with the the half breeds. Um but it doesn't necessarily give them immortality. Otherwise, the game wouldn't be very fun to play because you wouldn't be able to ever die in it. And so there would be no challenge. But apart from that, it it it allows the again the thread be to be stretched from those maybe real, maybe not real",

But apart from that, it it it allows the again the thread be to be stretched from those maybe real, maybe not real round table days all the way to this 1886 uh alternate history time frame. Yeah. Yeah. And like what's interesting about the Blackwater itself is the fact that not only does it do all that, it actually gives it it's used to explain first off the way they're able to heal heal, right? But then this thing black sight, right, where you're slowing down time, you have more time to shoot, right? You know, bullet time or whatever you want to call it video game. And it's a very video gamey thing, right? I mean I mean this black site and Blackwater are very video gamey things, but what is the video game without video gamey thing?

They talked about, well, you know, you're going to fight monsters. I'm like, okay, great. And then when we started playing, we were running up against these rebels, right, who it would look to be are calling themselves ravens, right? You see them there. They're out to protect it. It's interesting to know what their angle is going to be, right? Why are these people out there trying to stop these guys who are out fighting monsters, right? That are trying to save the day. And and this is why I'm riveted, I think, by this game more than anything is that there's a multi multi-layered conflict in the game. It's not about the order, these kind of roguish upper class dudes fighting, you know, again, the centuries long battle with the werewolves with with the half breeds. It's that the these rebels don't think that these esteemed order guys",

It's that the these rebels don't think that these esteemed order guys and and of course the government itself are are looking out for their best interest regardless. Maybe it's because we don't really know. I mean, maybe it's because they don't uh they don't quite appreciate the severity of the problem or maybe it's because they don't understand what these guys are doing and that the lives, you know, that they're risking. I mean right here, this is one of the most interesting ones, right? The half breeds of the West End riots. Obviously, West End riots are a real thing. You figure the rebels are probably going to be instigating this or something in the game, but then you have it where the half breeds there. Were they doing something? And like there's all these questions down here, right? Like if there was an army at the east end of London in 1886, what",

Like I love the breadcrumbs that are here right now already for the alternate history of what are we going to get when we play this game on February 2 0th? Absolutely. And I I I this is this is riveting because these unanswered questions are going to be the thread through the game, I think, as you get from point A to point B because we've only seen select parts of the game. We don't we're really not sure how long the campaign is. So, um it's these, you know, the gameplay is fun and the gameplay I think is immersive and the gunplay is really nice, but it's these questions and kind of answering the questions kind of how we feel about Uncharted. Uncharted is really fun to play. It's a great game, but we like to get to the next cut scene so we know what's going on next. The order",
