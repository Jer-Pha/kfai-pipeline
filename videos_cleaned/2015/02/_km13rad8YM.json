We, our careers have been defined by PlayStation. The first giant PlayStation 4 exclusive of the year is here, The Order: 1886. Uh, of course, maybe yesterday you caught us live streaming The Order: 1886 at 5:00 in the morning 'cause we're crazy, that's when the embargo lifted. Today for Free Play Friday though, we've gone back in time. Mhm. The Order just showed up at our house, 1886. No, not yet. The Order just showed up at our house. We're going to play the first 15 minutes of it. This is our first time ever playing The Order in, well, in the, yeah, its final retail. Let's be, you know, we played it. It's our first time ever playing The Order from the jump, as Tim would say. You know what I mean? This is, it's out of the box, the cellophane's off. I'm setting a 15-minute timer. Are you ready? Yep. 3, 1, go. No, don't save. There's no time for save. The first 15 minutes, it is what it",

The first 15 minutes, it is what it is. It is what it is. It is whatever you want it to be. Now, Colin, are you excited? I am excited. I'm looking forward to this game. I'm very interested to see, yeah, because like you said, there's a little time traveling going on. We filmed this the day we got the game, a week before it came out, right? And uh, they're probably talking right now. You care? Oh, no, this just bubbles. He's underwater. Somebody's underwater. Sorry. We filmed it the day the game, never mind. The thought's gone because he interrupted me already. The, the thought's gone. The thought's gone. Nothing else to say. Let's just watch the uh, the man not talking on the screen. I just want to make sure you're getting the experience you needed. All right. I don't know why Mom and Dad to f*** here we go. Why can't freak giving up the GH? Do you like this commentary I'm",

Don't worry. We'll come back and have another go later. Me right. Put the pair of handcuffs back on. Come on, get up. Up. Come on. You still no gameplay? That's fine. That's okay. Time to gameplay. 5 minutes? You think so? Yeah. It's a pretty cutscene though. Mm. Oh, looks great. It's kind of what I expected honestly, in terms of you not playing right away. Right? Yeah. I mean, I'm not mad about it. It's not been that long. It's been 3 minutes. Yeah. I mean, it's not almost terrible. 50. I guess not a terrible thing. Terrible. What if you got a trophy right now?

I don't know. You think we're, you think this is an Order character or you think we're a werewolf? Yeah, it's Galahad. Yeah, there you go. I wonder if this is like in the future. Yeah, right. And they're going to go once a night. This right? I don't think he's going to last much longer. No. Well, maybe later. 1886. Why do you insist on doing this? Then we've seen this already. We've seen this. He's going to break for you. This here we go again. They just want to know like where the bodies are. You're about ready. These things take time. Put them back here.

I was close. All right, so the first thing you do in the game is a QTE. Good. More of it. It isn't taking for into account how hard it is to wrestle somebody who's wet. I think he could get away from this one-armed guy. You should have had to hold R1 down when you, as you were pressing X one, like a Heavy Rain, the Origami Killer. That'd be awesome if this took place in the same universe as Heavy Rain. Yeah, right now I am a little disturbed. I mean, my first impression of the game is that I'm a little disturbed that it's teaching you how to use Quick Time Events before it teaches you how to move or shoot. Sure.

I, so I'd like to, I'd like to get to that. There you go. So we're going this way. Oh, looks like we got a touchscreen coming up, huh? Use that old touchpad. See, look at it. No, no. Oh, inter. I remember that from uh, the time we played a PlayStation. I would dock points off this then. Don't do that with an icon that clearly should be a touchpad with control. Come on, ready.
