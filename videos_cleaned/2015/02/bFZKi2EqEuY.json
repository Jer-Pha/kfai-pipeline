I, as always, am Tim Gettys. I'm here with the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. Hi. And again, we were joined by the Producer/Seducer back because no one demanded me. No, everyone, the comments were enthralled. Were they? By your, were they really? Is this true? This doesn't sound like something that was true. Some people like Nick's so funny. Some people liked, here's the thing, this is the Kinda Funny Gamescast. If you guys bring the games and the cast, I guess we'll bring the Kinda Funny. That sounds good to me and that'll balance it out and we'll give the people exactly what we're promising them and it's going to be give the people what they want, give them the Air Cagen.

And I was like, that sounds really cool, right? I'm thinking it's going to be a fairly more skew, a game more skewed toward, you know, the exploring the environment, but mostly kind of a first-person shooter. It is not. It is a hardcore RPG with resource management and it is like, and Greg totally lied to me. So I am like, I am like seven or eight hours into this game and I only 10% through the story of it and it is crushing me because it gets really hard, really fast.

Um, there's ways to trick the system, which I've, I've discovered. The Molotov, the Molotov cocktail is for me. We got to throw them on things, on bad guys.

No, no, there's a few of those, but this is one of those where you go all the way out toward the bridge and it's like he, uh, uh, Ryse sends you out to like basically extort money from people. The second group you go to is like this little, this little village underneath the bridge and you get in and it's just infested and there's the fast moving zombies that come after you, like they jump and come after you.

But I'm sure I'm missing something. I mean, the beauty of the game is that there's all these different ways to get through combat. I mean, you can be like very meticulous and and trap them and use Molotovs or use guns or use melee weapons or just ignore as many of them as you can. The the cool thing to you, those exploding zombies are good. The guys with the Hazmat suits on are really good too. If you hit them in the back, back right, explode. I'm liking it.

Um, they do a really good job with it. It's a really good game. I still haven't beaten it. Um, the Platinum Trophy in it is broken.

So their games, like this isn't the first one of their games that's totally botched and they still haven't patched it.

We told the story on Colin & Greg Live. But Riptide, I had early for Dead Island and I was out to be the first to Platinum it and ended up being caught up on the collectibles. And I was like, where are they? And I finally went on a Sunday, bought the guide, came home, put it down, this before the game came out and went through the magic marker, checking every collectible or 'cuz all the recordings and got to where the final collectible should be, walked in and it wasn't there.

She's just going to wait. Yeah, so I'm playing the game, but I'm just, I'm not getting all the safe zones. I'm not getting all the collectibles. I'm not getting all the side quests. How many time, how many times per session do you think you die? Um, is it very seldom at this point? 'Cuz I'm only, I, I die fairly often, I would say actually.

And then inside is just chaining fence with all these like power conductors and just hordes and hordes and hordes of zombies. And I died probably 10 times trying to do that side quest. And what sucks when you're dying on side quest is you lose experience points. Yeah, I keep, I think you lose that no matter what. I think you lose XP. Like if you die during certain quests, you don't, you don't lose really. Yeah, because every time I die, it it has a very unflattering red text that comes up and says, you just lost 600 experience points. Yeah, it sucks.

Although the very first trash bags, I don't know, close enough. Well, yeah, even the trash bags from a certain degree, like you can't jump off a tower and them, it'll still hurt you. But the the first side quest, or not the first side quest, the first time it turns night after you find that first drop and you look through it and it's like, oh God, it's night. And those those the badass zombies come at you. I could not pass that. So on the third time I died, it started me over during day at one of my safe zones. Was like, that was nice. It forgave you.

That could be a fun episode in the future, maybe an exclusive one or whatever for our Patreons about how to how to categorize, categorize games and what does it mean to be an action game, adventure. But I would, I would personally call Dying Light a sandbox game. I mean, it's, it's multiple layers. It's a sandbox open world sandbox game. It's nonlinear.

You don't talk to anyone, right? That's true. But that doesn't make, that doesn't make it a role play game either. That makes it more of like an adventure game in in my, in my opinion.

That was the thing about this when they debuted it and they were like, it's, it's Dead Island mixed with Mirror's Edge. That was concerning for me because Mirror's Edge for me and it didn't, I know it didn't work this way for everybody, felt disempowering, right? I didn't feel empowered at all in that game.

Or you're running up something and making the move you want to make, move, climb up a straight little bit of help, that little bit of extra push. Like it really just makes it feel so much more fluid.

This, they brilliantly captured what a fascist, futuristic fascist society looks like. It's colorful yet simple. It's, it's flat and clean and sterile. Exactly.

But when so when people were like, it's like Dead Island, which was a game that never really captured me to begin with. I played it for a few hours. Meets Mirror's Edge, which is another game where I'm like, all right, like, uh, but it was, it was the act of playing the game that really meant something to me. And I think that the game's really good. I think that for we, we're making fun of Techland for not being able to code progression in trophies. But the the the pathfinding and AI in the game is actually really intelligent. I'm really, I'm really intrigued by it. It must have been a very hard game to make because like you were saying, like you can grab on everything. There is a magnetism to jumping at things too that doesn't like look quite right, but it's forgiving to not frustrate you. I think that the game",

It matters in terms of like people knowing your game exists so that even market research shows that even if game X gets a horrible review score and people see it in there, they have they make a connection to buy that over a game that they've never heard of that maybe is a 10. Same thing here, Persona now means something. That name means something in the West, and I think that's a great move for bringing out your next one, your big one, and showing it off. So besides that though, just like gameplay wise though, do you don't you think that it loses something that stimer can't just take it with her wherever she goes?

Sure, and that's but that was one of those things that let's keep it in timeline context, right? That originally started as a PlayStation 2 console game that captured hearts and minds and then it just moved to a platform that was portable.

Yeah, and and sell millions of copies.

That's what I'm saying is I I understand when I said this on Colin & Greg Live too with Colin, I understand what he's saying about it not being a franchise that sells a gajillion copies of every game, but I think it's just because the people who played them and loved them have moved on. Maybe they played on their NES and stopped playing games. Maybe they played Super NES and stopped playing whatever. It doesn't matter. They went to a different platform or something like that.

And are they planning in their minds, I to say, well, this is going to tie into a game or I mean, it has to, you know? Like so I'm like, there's a lot of unanswered questions. And Nintendo's not going to say anything. Game. I mean, it depends. You're talking if they're talking about it now, they're developing the series. It could take upwards of a year or two to develop. And it I mean, you already have a Zelda game going like, you can't try to get those on",

And because it's Zelda. Zelda is one of the, well, he was saying that there's a game. I would say if you're talking about this, the Wii U Zelda, then yeah, sure, that's fun. If someone said, hey, there's a Halo series coming out soon, I'd be like, okay, we you damn sure you're going to expect something that they can push from a synergetic standpoint of like, okay, there's going to be DLC or something or a new map pack or a new Halo game. Last thing with Zelda, there is always something to push, whether it's the new game that will come out or the millions of other games that are already out and you can download in their various services.

Um similar to how, you know, I'm a firm believer that Amazon is one day going to beat all of these just because I think that Amazon is a powerhouse that has yet to really flex its muscle. Um and for some odd reason, Overstock.com is also getting into the content uh original content creation and distribution game. Yeah, they were at Sundance and they bought a bunch of stuff and they're trying to push their platform pretty heavily. Interesting. It's crazy. Yeah. Um but those the O the O fall in love with the O.

That's where the audience really now is. We just haven't really accepted that because there's a lot of old school thinking in Hollywood. Um but yeah, I mean, if Nintendo's serious about it, that that would give me pause to think, wow, maybe this will happen. If if there's another report saying, hey, we're developing this, I'm like, this is going to be good because that means Nintendo is playing ball and they're they're forward thinking and they're they want to put something out there that is not I don't want to say cutting edge because that's that would be not the best way to describe it, but something that's forward thinking enough to say like, we believe in that the audience is here and that they",

Well, Marvel gets it. We've seen in the last couple days more than anyone else. So, well, we'll see what we'll see how it all turns out. I'm I have a morbid curiosity to see how this turns out because because I don't think I agree with you guys that Zelda is the right choice. Maybe from a marketing standpoint, I don't think it's the right choice for the Nintendo IP stable for storytelling. And I think that I mean, if it's if it's all about marketing, just make a darn Mario show, you know, like like just do it. Mario sold what, 500 million copies? Mhm. Across all the games. So it's",

With both of these games, you have to write a story that doesn't exist. You I mean, Mario specifically, there's no story. Mario Mario Mario's story frankly is exactly the same as Zelda's. That's true. It's it's basically the same just different terms. What I would if they're going to if they announce tomorrow they're doing a Mario show, I would immediately skew it's going to be like The Mickey Mouse Club for kids. The one that's currently out. I don't know if anybody watches it, but when I was in Missouri, there's kids there. So I had to catch a couple episodes where it's just Mickey and Minnie doing stupid things and teaching the kids something. That's exactly what it would like.",
