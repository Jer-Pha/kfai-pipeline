I'm Greg, that's Tim, that's Nick, that's Colin, that's Portillo, and we're back to play more #IDARB. Guys, we had a lot of fun with this #IDARB. Yeah, great game, was surprisingly fun. We didn't have enough controllers, though, so we did one-on-one. Right. Now, Microsoft sent us a bunch of controllers. We're, XBox is helping us. Thank you, Microsoft. Get ready to actually do this. This. Yes, that was awesome. On top of that, a man named Fab made Kinda Funny characters for us. Ooh! But I believe only one team can be Kinda Funny. That's fine. I'm gonna be Teddy Roosevelt. All right, you're the Presidents, then . It doesn't really for us. We'll be Kinda Funny. We're together? All right. So that's how we're gonna do it. All right.",
