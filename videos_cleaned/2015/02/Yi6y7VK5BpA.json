Yet another reason why I'm glad I was an early SL late adopter of Netflix. Oh yeah, yeah, this is huge news, man. And you know, I'll be honest, like when I first heard this, like Netflix is a perfect, perfect, perfect platform for this. They're going to do what they always do, hopefully, fingers crossed, which is they're going to buy an entire season, which will be a nice in seon, it won't be 24 episodes, it'll probably more like 12 episodes, uh, and you're going to be able to watch it all at once, just like you would be able to play the game all at once at your leisure. You take in the content as you want to take it in. No no more commercial breaks, none of that stuff. I'm excited about this. So where this stands right now, this is from a report from The New York Times, right? And Wall Street Journal. Yes. And so they just announced this thing that",

And so they just announced this thing that this is a thing and they reached out for comment. Nintendo didn't say anything. Netflix didn't say anything. So right now this is very, very rumor. I mean this is the biggest, this if this is true, which I hope, I hope to God it is, this is the biggest thing that's come to Netflix ever. I mean this this could be bigger than Game of Thrones for HBO. This that's because it's it's Game of Thrones, but it's for a wide audience. Like this is for for kids, for adults, it's for everybody. Whereas Game of Thrones, like you can't be showing the the kids that, no you can't. I mean the most exciting part is for the one, the 0.001% of people that don't know what the Legend of Zelda is or for all those hardcore PlayStation fans or Xbox fans, this is going to be a great entry point into the series for me cuz for all",

I'm going to tell you something, he's definitely going to say, they're going to have to. That's my question. They're going to have to make him talk, right? Uh, what age do you think they're going to cast him at? Well , young Link, he's going to start young, he's going to be a little boy. The one thing that they did say was that cuz he looks like he's about 16. This this image is from a fan CGI thing, so this has nothing to do with not the series, but you know, hopefully, you know, we'll get some age going here. The thing with Zelda is there's so many different like, um, cannons to it and so different like takes on the same story, so I don't know what we'll get here, but it'll probably be the same idea. Link's a young kid, there's a Princess Zelda, they're",

Link's a young kid, there's a Princess Zelda, they're in the world of Hyrule, he needs the saver Ganon's, this evil pig monster. He might not be a pig monster, he might be a dude named Ganondorf, we don't know, but it's exciting. It's very exciting. If you had it, last question, if you had to choose a series as far as the storyline goes that they would as a jumping off point for this, what would it be? I'll put you on the spot there. Well, I mean, I I feel like it's the easy thing of O carina of Time. Yeah, but that would be so hard with cuz then you would need the young Link, you need the old Link, but that would be the most satisfying. That would definitely for the fans, I think that's what they were shaking his head behind the camera. It's not that hard, you cast two people and you go, you have awesome. Yeah, well, I know, but I'm just saying like I guess I guess you're",

Yeah, well, I know, but I'm just saying like I guess I guess you're right, but I'm saying in terms of it's not just casting the two people then you have the whole you have to deal with the same place, the old version and the new version, so it's a lot of production, it's a lot of production design. See, I think is this from the video side where it's like cuz you know, we didn't we didn't work on this, but back in the day IGN made the the April Fool's video for the Zelda movie trailer. Great, great April Fool's trailer exactly and imagine that but a whole series. No, I mean that's that's I think what we're all imagining, you know, don't count Netflix down. They are not a budget house. These guys are Netflix is going full stream. They're throwing tons hundreds of millions of dollars into their original programming. Daredevil they Daredevil looks fantastic. That trailer looks legit",

That trailer looks legit . It looks like a f anything better than it's on TV right now. So I mean they're going to put I would not be surprised if they put more than House of Cards money into this easily easily. So here's my question to you, do you think this is going to happen? I want it to happen. I just worry that there's you know, when you're developing your own original IP, it's really really e it's it's easier to get that to move forward, right? So Game of Thrones, there was not the only person I could really say no to that was George R Martin. There was no other kind of barriers or Gatekeepers for that. Nintendo has kind of historically been um a little harder to work with on that side, kind of a dick. Well, on his own series he is, man. Um but they're very very protective of their IP and rightfully so because their core content",

Um but they're very very protective of their IP and rightfully so because their core content offering, you know, their core IP is Mario, Zelda, what am I missing? That's right, Metroid, Star Fox, there you go. Um you know, these are their these are their Flagship series. You can't screw it these and so you know, we all remember what happened back in the early 90s with Mario. No, it was a great movie . Yeah, it was uh I don't know if your definition of great is a little different than mine. Um I think there I think if it happens it's going to be amazing. I hope it happens. I think this be cool another reason for me to keep giving Netflix my 8.99 mon. I just hope that at some point Link says, excuse me princess. That's all I need. Anyways, let us know in the comments what you think about this. Obviously we're excited. I don't think it's going to happen. This is just too good to be true and it's one of those things",

No, like lay him in front of the connect there. 10 years have passed in the shot. What I don't even get he's dead. No, that's the future. See like this is the shot when he standing up that was present day and then when you laid him I'm saying is is like to set to make this set into the future you just push him down you put some cobwebs yeah what Greg's saying is you go to a a party house supply store and you get some cobweb and the scene and put a coup C up BR that definitely be you know game accurate just put Link down and put some cobwebs up go like this there you go was that Prince or was that Zelda that's Prince",
