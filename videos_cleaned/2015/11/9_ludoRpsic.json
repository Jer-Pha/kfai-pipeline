I should have just said that from the beginning. But the uh, the first question comes from our boy Alex Cross, who we yesterday did a Google Hangout with, right? Excellent. Supported us over at Patreon.com. And uh, he had a question for us that I'm like, ah, I like that a lot. What would get you to pre-order a game? You know, we live in this world where back in the day pre-orders to me at least felt a little bit more natural as part of there limited supply. Yeah, so I wanted to make sure I got F-Zero GX on the GameCube. You know, I wanted to make sure Devil May Cry 2. So upset about that, but I wanted it, right?

Yeah, never. Like, do you guys? Yeah, really? No. I mean, but I mean, what I don't think pre-order means what it used to mean. Pre-order to me used to mean, oh man, I want Perfect Dark on day one, so I'm going to go do it. And hey, got a fanny pack out of the deal. That was whatever, cool. I got that. You'd go there because I I I had those those those days where I'd show up at uh EB and I'd Electronics Boutique still. I'd go into EB and try to get the game and they'd be like, oh, we only got two and we're out. And then you go to Target and they didn't have it and you know, you'd be screwed, right?

If I if we're not going to get it, you know, through a review thing or whatever, when it comes down to that point, I'm like, well, I want that. I want to make sure I have that to go as soon as possible. And that for me, it comes down to brand loyalty more than anything, right? Like I know like, here's a great example, right? Fallout 4. Fallout 4 is announced. Finally, hooray! I'm going to buy Fallout 4 for sure. I'm probably going to love Fallout 4 for sure. Awesome. But then they say, we're putting out the limited edition with the Pip-Boy. And I'm like, I love Bethesda. I love the Fallout brand.

You know what I mean? That's what motivated me to do it in that point. If I hadn't done it and now here we were and we're coming up on Tuesday 9, 9:01 p.m., you know what I mean, Pacific time out here, I guess Monday 9:01 Pacific time, I'd still be like, all right, cool. If I hadn't gotten the game through hook or crook by now, I would have I'd pre-order it and do it just so I'm ready to go. It's pre-loaded for me.

I'm not pre-ordering every game I'm interested in, right? Like there's enough games that come out and I'm like, well, I'd see how that one turns out before I throw money at it. But when it's Rocksteady, when it's Bethesda, when it's whoever, I know that I want it and I'm at a fever pitch of excitement and I want to play it right away. Yeah, I for me, a long time ago, it was like more of a Pip-Boy type situation where it's like where there's something that I want that I couldn't get otherwise.

Um, other random things like Soulcalibur III, you got the soundtrack CD. I'm really into video game soundtracks. That entices me. Um, had Super Mario Galaxy come with the soundtrack, I would have wanted to pre-order for sure. You know, so there's certain things like that. If it's a **** fanny pack or whatever, that was always just kind of like that **** I never really wanted, right? I remember when I I Maximo: Ghost to Glory, like totally like I read the preview, exactly. I love the pre the previews and all this stuff.

And I guess that's the other thing is like with Amazon, especially with Prime, it's just kind of like, all right, if you pre-order it, you'll get it the date the first day. And see, this is what I'm talking about is that pre-order to me no longer means pre-order to get something. I pre-order that Doctor Who level pack, right? I played Lego Dimensions. I'm in love with Lego Dimensions. The Doctor Who uh part of the Lego Dimensions campaign, I was like, this is really fun. And the level packs have been great. **** y'all. And I just clicked the button and forgot about it because I didn't want to today have to go out or yesterday go out and try and find it, right? It just shows up like, oh, great, perfect.

And with Amazon Now, which is their new thing where like, I'm not too sure of the details of this, but it's essentially it's as fast as humanly possible to get the thing from you ordering it to it coming to you. And a big push for them wherever Amazon Now is available for Black Ops 3's launch, they'll get it to you for midnight. Like for that midnight launch. And it's like, we're just getting closer and closer to things like that where there is no even reason to ever leave your house, right? And that's the thing, right? Like midnight launches used to be a thing or I mean, they still are a thing, right? But now when there's a game I want that bad for what I'm I'm I'm already saying it, right? 9:01, 9:01, 9:01.

That's my biggest problem, the digital thing where I like the physical copy so much that creates problems because I wanted it 9:01, but I can't get it then. I need wait till midnight. And it's like when I got you a code for Metal Gear Solid V and then you bought Metal Gear Solid box. Yeah, everyone wanted it. It's worth it. It looks really. No, I I'm hear you. I'm with you. But yeah, I don't think pre-order means what it means anymore. Yeah, no, for sure. But is there anything that can make you pre-order a game? I used pre-order a lot of games because I mean, back in the day, um, PS1, PS2 era, I would say GameCube and all that kind of stuff is because it was just a way for me to pay the game off ahead of time. It was like me like, it's like why I clean the house on Saturday so I don't have to do anything for",

It was like me like, it's like why I clean the house on Saturday so I don't have to do anything for football on Sunday. It's because everything's done and then I'm ready to go. So that was the only reason I used to do it. I didn't want like anything out of it. The last games I remember like really going in pre-ordering were like uh Resident Evil Zero and like the Resident Evil re-releases on GameCube. I don't know why I remember that so well. And that was in 2003, I think. So I I didn't I didn't do much pre-ordering after that. Uh people have to remember that back especially in the cartridge era, uh there really were a finite amount of games. It wasn't clear that games would be republished ever. Um because of the allocation of chips were where expensive and the allocation of cartridges were it was hard. The example I use is Rings of Power was Naughty Dog's Genesis game. It was an RPG and that game had I",

It was an RPG and that game had I think one round of publishing of like 100 or 100,000 cartridges. And the game was successful. Um, but as far as I understand, uh EA couldn't let them publish more copies of the game because the allocation of chips and cartridges were spent on Madden. And so they couldn't they're like, we have no cartridges, right? And so so there in other words, there was an imperative to pre-order back in the day if you really wanted something because it was not clear because there was no digital alternative. And there was no back in the day. I mean, they did it a little bit on NES and on SNES, but not not to the degree they did it on PS1 and PS2 like the Classics kind of Series where they they discount it. That would really became a thing more. I mean, that was became a really common thing with with PS1 games especially",

I mean, that was became a really common thing with with PS1 games especially with the green the green spine PS1 games and then the red spine PS2 games. Um, but now there's an infinite amount of games. So there's no real reason to pre-order anything unless you want one of the pre-order bonuses, uh DLC or whatever physical good it is because if there if if Metal Gear Solid V is going to sell 20 million copies, let's say. I mean, it's not going to, but let's say it it it did and they only publish 10 million 10 million of them. Well, there's an infinite amount of them you can download. It's not. So what would have me pre-order is a discount. And I think that's another thing. Um, so like Gamers Club Unlock from Best Buy. I don't know how familiar you are with this. It's a **** great deal. You pay X amount of money a year for it. And like there's discounts on it all the time that make it like",

And you get so many things that entices you to pre-order because it's like pre-order this, you get $5 off. And it's like, if you buy games like every month, that **** adds up so quickly. I think that's an enticing reason to pre-order. Yeah, should you have to pay to pre-order? But yeah, Darth Kovak says, hi guys, love your content. The topic is, what's the game you spent the most time in? I think the the highest I've ever seen my in-game clock was 110 hours, which isn't that much. Yeah, um, in Final Fantasy X, because I wanted all the legendary weapons and all the Blitzball ****. And I wanted everything. I wanted I platinumed that game. Yeah, for all intensive purposes.

But I definitely think the game that I spent the most time in is Super Smash Bros. Specifically, I would probably give it to Brawl. Like the most time dedicated to. Yeah, um, Brawl, Melee, and then the Wii U one. But if count Super Smash Bros. as just one thing, franchise, then definitely that's hundreds and hundreds of hours. Sure. I mean, for me, I it's hard because like so many games don't put clocks on them, right? But I guess I can't think of I mean, like you're talking about, I was talking about Metal Gear Solid 3, right? That I platinumed that I did everything. I had the memory card. Every always heard that story. But the in terms of sheer numbers, it's DC Universe Online, right?

So it's I don't know. That's just me. Amnesiac says, hi guys, just wondering what your thoughts are on emulation and video game piracy. Pirating a game that is still purchasable from the publisher on PSN or the Virtual Console, for instance, is wrong because you are not giving money to the people who created the game. But what about used games or games that aren't easy to find anymore? Take Little Samson on the NES, for example. That game fetches absurd amounts of money on the web. Cost about $800",

That game fetches absurd amounts of money on the web. Cost about $800 and has extremely little to no chance of ever being re-released in any form. So is it really that bad if you can if you pirate it? Also, the creators aren't getting any of your money when you buy a used game either. What's your take on emulation and piracy and when is it justifiable? I think I might be looser than you are guys without hearing your answers. Like to me, I think piracy is just part of the world and part of how things work nowadays in the modern world. And they have been for the past 10 years. And while it is a bad thing, I think that the positives of it overcome the negatives in the sense that the people that aren't buying it, majority of them aren't going to buy it no matter what. But I do think that you are getting more people to buy it based on trying it out, seeing if they like it",

It's a way for me to play games that I didn't know about that people have talked about before that I just want to try and see if I like it. If they do release it on PSN or Virtual Console and all that, yeah, I'll I'll want to buy it. But at the same time, a lot of the times emulation is better than their emulation.

If you're emulating or you're pirating something, you're stealing it. And it doesn't matter if it's old or new, you're stealing it. And what you're doing is wrong and illegal in the in the main, right? I mean, and that's just where we have to start with the conversation. So I start from that place because I think that if a game is currently available and easy to find and reasonable to find, then it's probably wrong to pirate it. So that even might go back to your PS2 or your PS1. I mean, depending on the game you're talking about. But I think at some point, just being again, intellectually honest, is it really financially destructive for you to to emulate Sunsoft's Batman, which has no",

Probably not.

So we have to I think we have to kind of look at these things in different kinds of ways. I don't think that it's necessarily wrong. It might actually be positive in some ways. Um for people to be able to emulate NES games because a lot of younger people or people that don't have the means to acquire these games will never have an opportunity to play what I think is the greatest catalog of games ever.
