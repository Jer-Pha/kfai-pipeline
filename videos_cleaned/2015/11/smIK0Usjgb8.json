It's a classic classic uh pinnacle series Xenoblade. I've never played Xenoblade before. I'm going to I'm going to go on a limb and say I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. Tim and Greg thought it would be really funny if I just did this let's play by myself. Kevin is standing to my right and he's already laughed at me five times. He tried to get me to pronounce the game Xenoblade uh just to screw with me because that's those are the co-workers. Those are the people I have. Um so here we go. We're in space which is one of my least favorite places to be. There's no oxygen in space. Xenoblade Chronicles X. I didn't even get the title right when I said it. It's either X or 10. We don't know. Is it 10? It's probably going to say it's 10. We're going to go with 10. um seminal game in the series. Nine others we all",

Uh Xenoblade of course being a uh very very important title for that computer. So here we're seeing some fun stuff on screen. This looks pretty dope. I don't know what the hell's happening but I'm excited. No idea what this game is really. I've heard the I've heard the name before Kevin. A lot of people say Xenoblade. Uh I get that confused. Of course Colin's favorite game Tales of Zestiria or whatever the hell he's playing these days. AD 054 AD. Their weapons were terrifying and powerful beyond human. Yeah. Freaking our asses torn apart on this one huh? Kev see this? Never mind. The coalition knew the war was coming. In response they prepared.

Good thing we had those interstellar arcs prepared when the aliens attack from our cradle. Would have been real bad if they cut us the pants down on that one. You know what I mean? That always amazes me that we have just the right technology to get out of Earth when the aliens attack and all these things. You ever seen Battlestar Galactica? Exactly. Starship. The White Whale. The White Whale is the name of our starship. After leaving Earth behind we spent two years wandering in space. Searching. Okay. We thought of ourselves as the lucky ones.

I don't know how long it is. Could be an hour. Could be a 74 hour experience. I don't know. I don't really know. One thing I do know is when Kevin sips iced coffee he sips it with his belly like like this has to get the extra little you know little oomph. All right. dialog in Elma. So far it's riveting. Engage.
