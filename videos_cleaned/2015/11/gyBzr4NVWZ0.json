Now, Tim, we have a history with this. Yeah, we do. A few months ago, we went to Nintendo. Mr. Nintendo was there. Mr. Nintendo did a bunch of Let's Plays there, a whole bunch with Star Fox, the Zeldas, your Mario Maker. Back in the day, we played this Mario Tennis. You knew that I was a big tennis fan, not of the real sport, mind you, just a video game ten of the Mario variety. Oh, any kind of video game. Got it, got it, got it. And you said, \"I bet I can beat you.\" And we went Toe to Toe in the court. Mhm. Our friendship was tested, almost broken. Yes. And in the end, you won. I did win. I also beat you in Smash Bros. I also beat you in Mario Kart. Now, the Smash Bros. I will never argue that you were better than me. You did beat me here in a Mario Kart Let's Play as well, but I would, I have been aching to get back to that and because I still think I'm better",

Well, today we're going to prove who's the championship. The traveling Championship is going to be decided here in Mario Tennis right now in this thing. So here we go, we're going to jump in. All right, so now we're going to do this traveling Championship deciding, right? 'Cause this is, is this going to be like a championship belt? We need a championship belt. We have a championship belt. Nintendo World Championship. Some could call it. Let's call this a Nintendo San Francisco Championship. Okay, I like Nintendo Kinda Funny Championship. Nintendo, Nintendo this room champion. No, Nintendo, the Kinda Funny Nintendo Championship is a good one. Okay, okay, good. Let us know in the comments if it should be a championship belt or trophy.

You know, they say if there's grass in the field, let's go. All right. Uh, one set, is that what we're doing? One set. One definitive set here. One definitive set of two games. Two definitive games. 'Cause that means you have to win two games. Yes. Okay, that is okay. Hold on. How do you want to do this with your Wii U GamePad Pro Controller for life? Go, go down, down to reverse. All know, let's not do that. Although actually that's kind of cool. Yeah, let's see that. What do that just sees what I'm doing? You're cheating. Your screen looking at me.

If you're new to the Nintendo World. Oh my gosh. Okay, Boo. Too hot to hand, too cold to hold. To a bad start, I would say. Look at this replay. He's booing things up. Booing it up.

We could have just been best friends for rest of our lives and you said you wanted to put a championship on line. Insult my Mario Kart skills, no less. You know what? What? I'm not okay with this. All right, well, I suggest you step it up. Okay, I will. Dang, Boo. Dang, Boo. No time for smack talk. I don't like serious Rosalina. Are you kidding me? My Lumas are out there.
