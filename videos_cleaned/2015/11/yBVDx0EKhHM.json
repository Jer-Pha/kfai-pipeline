Submit your topic for the show just like Innocence did. Hey guys, this might be quick, but oh what the hell. My topic suggestion is Valve and Half-Life 3. Will they ever release it? It may seem obvious to some, but in reality Valve doesn't have to. Thank you and keep up the great work. I think they will, but I agree that they, I agree that they won't have to. And I always, I've said it before, I always look Charles Onyett's idea that that they'll just release when it's done. They won't know lead-up, no nothing to. And I would be, I would love if they did it where they didn't say anything like it was uploaded. There's nothing ever said. I'll respond an email. Those epic things in humanity's history.

It's true, they don't have to and in fact they have more to lose by doing it than gain to gain because the fact remains that Half-Life is a really beloved franchise, but it is not Grand Theft Auto or something like where there's not a financial imperative for them to do this. They might hurt themselves not financially 'cause they have so much money from Steam, but they might hurt the creator that you like if Half-Life 3 isn't good or not as good as people expect it then they then isn't f***ing life changing fantastic yet. And that's the problem. Well, it's it's Duke Nukem Forever, it's The Last Guardian. It's it's been cooking for so long and it's more its nose.

It's what I said about The Last Guardian. What it would have, you know, I don't know in what state of readiness it was on on PS3 when when Clemens played it a long time ago when he went to see an GP in in Tokyo. So this was in 2010, maybe 2011. I don't know like what state it was in at that point, but what Sony have gained more financially and critically if they just released a 6.0 then release this game now that cannot no matter how good it is will never live up to the like Google asked Guardian what has to be one of the best games of all time to live up to the hype that it's behind it.

It's going to sell well, but if I were there I would have definitely considered canceling it. Mm-hmm. So it's I'm sure they did consider that. So it's a similar conundrum where the game, you know, no matter how good Half-Life 3 is, it's not gonna be as good as people want it to be which is the you know, which is a credit to Half-Life, but also a problem for a company like Valve that has no financial imperative to make a game ever again and they can just make their money passively on Steam and be fine. Do you think we'll see it before 2020? Yeah, I do. Half-Life 3 before 2020. I think it's in development right now. I think it has been for several years. Yeah, why not? Mm-hmm.

Yeah, like it is why even bother at that point? Yeah, you know, they're almost the point was like why even bother now? Yeah, I mean, I feel like pretty much is at that point. At least, you know, getting new people on or whatever. It's just don't do it or do it cool. Borden says, how much do you guys think streaming support or the lack of could tip the scales of VR reality really catching on? Streaming games, the stream movies. I think I think what he's talking about as being it there's no way to stream VR like with Twitch and YouTube.

Oh yeah, it's a game where like it'll ask you a question then you have to make a fake answer to the question then the people have to pick which answer they should buy that. It's a great game. That sounds good. I last played it on Xbox One with our friend Nate. However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find games that are that offer local multiplayer outside of that. We you and the exclusive split-screen and Halo Guardians increases my concerns. What are your thoughts on this and you feels the local multiplayer is on its way out completely?

That's all you ever just as the machines get more and more powerful, the harder and harder it is to do this to render the game twice to make it look as good at deliver the experience you want. Well, and in addition to that with with online going from this like kind of niche thing that's just kind of a gimmick to being the way people play games. Split-screen is, you know, on its way out. I remember when the first time that I was upset by a game not having split-screen was Counter-Strike on the Xbox. Yeah, it came and I was just like, well, I'm f***ed.

And now with Halo 5, I mean, it sucks. Like it is definitely like when my friend's birthday comes up around Thanksgiving, we're playing all weekend. We're not gonna be hit playing Halo 5 because it's not split-screen. Play Master Chief Collection just for fun, you know. So I mean, it's it's their technical. I mean, people have to remember that it's really hard to make a game run twice or four times these days because they're so they're so intense.

Do does anyone go in this corner on this f***ing map at all? Does anyone find this collectible? Like they know they have very detailed statistics and I'm telling you that they looked at their stats and they're like, no one cares about couch co-op. You know, like like they it was important to the two if they looked at Halo and they're like, this is actually important to lots of Halo gamers than it would be in there.

It's just the fact that like there's no they also want to control the narrative. They want more people playing online. So by not having the splits, why do they care if the people play online them? Like why why does the developer of care like how you play the game? If people if they looked at Halo and we're like 90 percent of people play Halo couch co-op, like they're not gonna cut it out. They probably look that in there like less than 5 percent of the people that buy Halo play couch co-op. So why would we even bother?

Yeah, you know, I mean like something missing out of a game is going to be important to literally every single person, but they have to make choices. Remember it goes both ways. I was tell a story, right? That you know, they went out of their way the Lego guys to make sure that Lego Star Wars when it came to Xbox 360, right?

And that's what you're talking about like and the ref the places he's referencing, you know, he's talking about Rocket League. You know how we've talked about games like Chariot, these indie games that are easier to play games together with couch co-op. Diablo, right? Like those are developers saying it's not only important if you're starting from scratch, I guess, but if you're starting from a game where you're gonna get big like Rocket League, you know, your game works that way and it works well that way.

You should have all those things already if you're a true fan. It sucks if people are into those things. It's just that like that's a dying meat. That's a dying way to play games. It's just not it's not gonna be that way anymore. There's always gonna be local co-op games. Well, you talk about Chariot or someone that like this is a very easy to render side scroller that even if you play a co-op like it's just another sprite on the screen.

Yeah, it's not it's just wait like running Halo 5. It's probably really complicated or maybe you want to lay low. Not having split-screen co-op is not Halo, you know, but well sure, but you have to ask yourself if like 343 and back in the day Bungie, we're looking at statistics and and realizing that these things were going to die like that. Like they're keeping these in to placate a certain amount of people. When you're making a game, you know, when you're a producer of a game, you have producers live in spreadsheets.

There's there's also a financial imperative to.

It's just that it was an Assassin's Creed game. So it wasn't fun. You know, that's that's that's a mate. I always wanted a real time or not a real time a turn-based almost cartoonish economic and strategy game based in the Revolution. So like a Fancy Tactics style game and American Revolution. I think would be f***ing awesome. But I mean, that's it. That's a even had like ideas and little designs drawn down about it being a 3D or it was back into the '80s game, but that would be like I just like that time period. I don't think it's off.

So that's not fun. World War One isn't really fun to explore in that because it's it's it's f***ing trench warfare and though and the frontline moved like 10 miles in five years or even cares. You know, it's it's so it's we need to figure out new and clever genres in new ways to attack these different these different things. And I think Assassin's Creed was the one that could have done it the best, but they just, you know, Kirk Hamilton at Kotaku wrote a great story last week about Assassin's Creed where his basic line was like, why isn't this fun?
