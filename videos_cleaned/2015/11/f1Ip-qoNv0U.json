Snyder alludes to some of this. We glimpse Rorschach and his civvies wandering around with his sign but it never coheres.

Like adding that stuff is going to change things but I think that they changed things in line with what the story was, sure. Um, but yeah, I mean, at the same time, a movie is only so long, make sacrifices, yeah. Whereas this graphic novel is, you know, there's a lot more information, there was a lot more opportunities and what Colin was talking about the last couple topics, it's like it kind of leaves a lot up more up to you.

I watched Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, which I surprisingly liked. I liked a lot more than I thought I was going to like because they got shat on. Um, and I thought it was actually pretty good. I'm like, I don't people's problems with this, but it's that style. People just can't get into it. It's like that purposely really, really cartoony style. I I love 300. I even liked the the second one, Rise of an Empire. That story could have been told in such a cool way and it wasn't in my opinion. It was such a waste. I I remember watching, go back and read the graphic novel. It's awesome with Mark Ryan. Remember I he and I went and watched it and I was just like, huh, like what a waste. I think you might be missing out on what it turned out to be because if you watch it as a comedy, you will be very entertained. If you that and Troy, if you watch them as Troy, I did see as well, watched them as comedy at one point in",

Brad Pitt just looks at a whole army and yells, is there no one else? And I just lose it every time. It's hilarious. He stood in front of a ton of people and did that and and everyone expected like, you're going to be in the theater like Achilles. And I'm just like, I'm just like, what the hell Brad Pitt doing? He's looking dope in that shat armor, cool as shat. The same thing in 300. They bring out Xerxes on that giant thing. Every time I see that dude, I just start laughing. Well, that that purposely was supposed to be kind of a weird look. He was supposed to be kind of an androgynous sort of weird looking ethereal character. I liked 300. I got into it.

Go in with your expectations set to it not being a superhero movie and you might like it a little bit more. And and for the love of God, stop giving Zack Snyder so much shat. He's a good, he's a good filmmaker. I'm with you on that one. Everyone just for some shat reason, he became like when he hit, yeah, he hit the market with 300 and it's exactly what you're talking about. The shat trailer came out and everyone was like, this is going to be the coolest movie ever made. And then people saw it and they were like, wow, that's really stylized. I didn't like it. But instead of and I loved it. I loved 300. I still think it was it was a great film just because I liked that that it was different and they were trying something new.
