We recorded topics three and four that you will hear in the future after this happens. But for now, we're just going to talk Nintendo. We're getting right into it. I am so excited. That was a good one. It was a good one. Y'all talking **** the whole time, but I don't care. We weren't. It wasn't ****. No, it was a good one. It was good. It was fine. It was good. It wasn't just fine, it was good. Big surprise there. Here's, here's the thing. Yes, of course, it was the big surprise. But my thing with the Nintendo Direct, there's nothing besides E3 that gets me more excited in video games than Nintendo Directs. Not playing Nintendo games. You get more excited about the Directs.

That's true. That was the biggest pop you gave that whole thing is when at the end they're like, \"The Smash Bros. there's more Smash Bros. coming December.\" You're like, you put up your hands. That's great. Such a good sign. So, man, I just, but I love it. I love announcements and I love that there's this presentation and here's 45 minutes. Yeah, we're going to see a bunch of **** we don't want. Sure, but that's they need to do. It's a press conference. You know what I mean? Usually you have to wait for press conference.

No, but I thought I had a good time. It was a fun conference. I wasn't talking ****. We're doing the same thing we do at every Comer, just like Mystery Science Theater. But I just, you know, I get really defensive over Nintendo. Your, I can see it in your eyes. That's why I just back off a little bit sometimes. No, you don't need to do that. Like with the Star Fox game that looks like it's a GameCube game. You know what, we'll get to the Star Fox game.

I mean, I'll tell you right now, I mean, this just broke right before we started recording. NPDs are out. Yoshi's Woolly World was the eighth bestselling game at retail in the United States. Out the Y. I've been telling it outsold Uncharted and Nathan Drake Collection, um, which came in at number nine. Although, uh, it's worth noting that the NPD numbers do not count, uh, bundles, um, which I'm sure PS4 sold plenty of with the Nathan Drake Collection. But I, I say that just to show that there is a group of people that are still buying these even more obscure, um, or not as desirable exclusives. So when you see something like Zelda being confirmed is still a Wii U game, which is not a huge surprise, uh, that shows that that game is going to sell very well when it comes out.

Greg owes me a burrito 'cause he said, \"This ain't happening.\" I was like, \"What's wrong with you?\" When did you say that? Why cannibal? Yeah, but I thought, why cannibalize your Zelda game that apparently is not coming in 2016? I don't care. They said 2016. It's not coming in 2016. I'll double down. I'll put another burrito on the line that you're not getting your Zelda Wii U in 2016. Now, I mean, I don't want to bet that if it doesn't come out 2016, I'm in trouble. I don't believe that.

It makes no sense for it not, especially this, this Direct confirms it to me. Yeah, absolutely. So, but I'm, wait, wait, wait. Before we move, why would you make that bet? It like conclusively leaked that like a month ago. I like making entertaining shows where Tim and I argue about things and I, I'll buy a burrito anytime. Yeah, it's not like I bet him 100 bucks. I wasn't like, I was like, \"It's going to happen.\" But so you make bets just to make them. Your bets don't mean anything. People get engaged. They talk about it then on Twitter and they tweeted us about it. I thought it was a dumb move. So, but now if I, if I really don't, now if this Zelda game is going to be so far out. Yeah, yeah.

I mean, it gets, I think it gets shot on a lot. It's definitely, it's, I think it's, it's not, it is good. It's just not amazing. Forgettable. It was definitely a decline in quality, um, that I think really actually started with more like The Minish Cap than anything else. And then kind of just started like Wind Waker was to, to me the last, I **** love Wind Waker. And, and to me that was the last truly interesting, just aesthetically pleasing, really interesting looking, different kind of Zelda game. By the time I got the Skyward Sword, I just didn't care anymore because Twilight Princess I felt so burned on.

And all I remember is fringe fingers and turning into a wolf in the beginning. Like, I don't remember that game. I played that game. Sucked. I played that game stem to and just don't know, don't remember anything about it 'cause I just, meanwhile, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, uh, Wind Waker, these are things, you know what I mean? Even, uh, Link Between Worlds recently, right? Like, I remember moments of how much fun I was having in this game.

Like, God damn, that's funny. I, I like Twilight Princess. It's not my favorite Zelda game, but I don't think it's as bad as people make it out to be. But I will say that watching the an HD trailer, I was excited 'cause I knew this was coming. I want a burrito off of it, damn it. But I was excited to see the trailer 'cause I thought it was going to be impressive to me in the way that Wind Waker HD, when I saw that trailer, I was like, \"Oh, this looks good.\" You know? And yeah, the cell-shaded, it cell-shaded works better in the HD-ifying of things. Yeah, but I thought Twilight Princess was going to look a little better.

It's, I thought I'd get a little bit more of like, \"Oh.\" And I didn't. Yeah. Um, but there's a Wolf Link amiibo. So Zigger's happy out there. Of course, Zigger must be. He's probably in a coma right now with all the amiibo talk and all these different amiibos. I'll say that I think it's a smart move for them to release the game because a lot of people do love it. And, and there is not, you know, there's a dearth of games on Wii U. So I mean, I think it makes perfect sense. Even if it was, even if Zelda, the new Zelda was going to come out in the summer or something like that, I don't think it, I don't think that the release of it affects it at all.

There was little like, it was on the eShop. It was like, \"Of course it's going to.\" Yeah. And the, the big thing about the Direct for me is like, there's, there was so many games talked about. Some of them for just three seconds. But like, that's all I need. It's just like, there's a lot of Nintendo things happening. Not all of it's going to be for you, but there's going to be a lot of it. This Direct had so many things that I was just like, \"Yes, thank you. This is what I care about.\" Maybe no, no one else does, but I **** do. Um, moving on. My boy, Bill Trinen. Oh, also they talked about the, the new Zelda and they said 2016 that it's coming. It's coming to Wii U in 2016. Still coming. They showed like",

Um, have a lot, I have a lot of hope in that game actually. I hope compatible with the Wolf Link amiibo or whatever that's worth. There's other, you can put the other Wii U amiibos, Zelda themed amiibos. Take your time with that game. All the time you need on NX. But they, I mean, it's, I mean, they, they re, I still think it might be on the NX too. But if we believe the NX might come out next fall, which I don't think it will. I'm burping.

I wished that in the time we hadn't heard about the game, they just completely moved over and started fresh on the NX. It's still possible that they're doing that again. Remember like we said it before, they're in the space in between right now. And so they can't necessarily, you know, Twilight Princess was a GameCube and a Wii game. And I, I don't, I don't necessarily think that it's not, it's impossible that this is the same thing. They just can't say that. Yeah, yeah. No, and I, I think I will be shocked if this game's not on NX in some form. My biggest question is if this is a 2016 game, the NX isn't in 2016. What do they do with it?

And that's going to make people want to buy it either again or wait and buy that version. Yeah, I think I just, I don't believe that NX is going to come out next year simply because it doesn't seem, it seemed so back in like between the NES and SNES transition in '91. NES was still like really viable actually for a long time. I mean, they were releasing first-party Nintendo games in 1994. Um, so it was, it was, it was different then. SNES and N64 was a little more tapered. And by the time you got to GameCube, N64 was basically dead. Um, I remember the last N64 games I bought were in the spring of 2001.

And the, the release schedule of some of the games still on Wii U, uh, in 2016 indicate to me that NX, it just wouldn't make sense to release NX then. You know, I don't think it's, I don't think NX is a fall 2017, but I think it's probably maybe spring 2017. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, my money's on 2016. But just 'cause I, we don't have anything besides Zelda left for the latter half of the year. No, but, but still, I just feel like you want it to taper and have some a vacuum of excitement before you, you don't want to, this was the same, was the argument I made with why Zelda shouldn't move over to NX completely.

It's because you don't want to burn the people that are guaranteed going to be there for you. The only people that are guaranteed going to be there for you, the people that own Wii U. So it's, it's as long as you treat them well towards the end of the life cycle. Like Nintendo's fan base is, is demonstrably shrinking. And you need to take care of those people before you try to expand out where the Blue Ocean strategy kind of thing only works when you have a strong, which is why the Wii, I think succeeded because I just don't, I feel like I just burn me, burn me hard. Let's move on. I want, I want good things. I think you're in the minority that, I think you're in the minority on that. But I mean, I, as we, we're adults with, with some disposable income, right?

Like, give it some time to die. See, my argument to that would be that the people that aren't adults with money aren't the people that are clamoring for this Zelda game. Like those are the ones that are playing all these other games that I don't care about. Like the Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival or whatever the hell it's called. We'll find out. I hope I'm, I hope I'm wrong just in the sense that I want to see what the hell this thing is. But and I, I think we will see it at E3. But, um, it would be nice for it to come out in the fall.

Mario Maker has a portal site where you can go on the internet and like look at websites that way, download them and sync them to your console later. Hell yes. All of this to me is great news. This is what I want from Nintendo where it's these games are platforms. You're not going to need to wait for 10 years for the sequel to come out or whatever. You get these.

Then they started talking about some eShop titles. Pokemon Picross, which I've never been a big Picross guy. No, it's, it's interesting to see that come out. And it's a, it's a, you know, this was, this one of the free to start games. Picross. Yeah, it seems like this is like a new model in conjunction with the, the rumors that all the Nintendo mobile games are going to be free to play. So this seems like they're just exploring, not that this is the first time they've done it, but to explore, uh, the, the a different kind of pricing model. Whatever.

So then the eShop title that I'm most excited about is the one called Fast Racing Neo. We've seen it before a little bit, but we're not getting a new F-Zero. Yeah, like F-Out or something. But it's like pretty much a spiritual successor to the N64, um, era of those games. And oh my God, looks, that looks great. **** four player split screen. I'm not a racing fan, so I really don't. I see, I love that type of stuff. Like I, I love the futuristic racers and I loved F-Zero. So very stoked about that. Surprised they should slap F-Zero on it. I know.

Like, I mean, when I say amazing, I mean very, very solid eight out of 10. Are you going to fight? Yeah, that looks awesome. I mean, it looks, it's a fighting game that, that's how I imagine Pokemon games would be when I was a dumb little kid. You know, like that's what the cartoons looked like.

You know, like just do what you need, you know, you need to do with this series. Put a **** full Pokemon game on mobile and make an MMO for your console. Just do it. Just **** do it already. I don't. NX, NX, bro. We'll see. Final Fantasy Explorers on the 3DS. I think that can look cool. Yeah, I don't really care too much. But that definitely looks like a Colin Moriarty special. Yeah, it's just cool little cool matchup. I mean, I, I like, I like that kind of stuff with, uh, kind of celebrating Final Fantasy's heritage before it was, uh, what it is now.

It's cool to see them all together in more of a actual, it's not really, didn't look too much like an RPG, but like an actual RPG game. Usually we see them together in fighting games or like music games or stuff like that. Um, then Star Fox. We saw a trailer. April 22nd is the new release date. We saw more of the Walker. The Landmaster now has a Gravmaster mode that like the tank kind of hovers and stuff. They went through the controls and stuff. That's just the normal thing. It's always been right.

And I, I'm not, I'm not in a, I'm not a guy that really gets hung up on aesthetic. I really don't. Like we're playing Fallout 4 now. And I know a lot of people think that game's ugly. But that's not really one of the problems with the game in my opinion. Um, it's just that when you think about Star Fox's heritage, especially on Super Nintendo and N64, those games showcase those consoles in ways that other games didn't. And they weren't necessarily the prettiest, the most technologically advanced by the time you got to the end of the cycle. But when you look back at what Star Fox was doing early on SNES, uh, early to mid through, through its life, it was a pretty extraordinary game.

You do. I need to play one? Yeah, you should. We can need a different star. We can trade wirelessly now, which is a new function, which is cool. No Link Cables needed. I'm very excited about this.

So it's there, there's, there's lineage, there's a history, there's like a defend definitive history. There are three Metal Gear games that were on Nintendo platforms only. Um, so including a few cool Snake's Revenge as well. So it's, it's one of these things where I see Cloud and I'm like, all right, well, Final Fantasy VII's only Nintendo Connection in the main is that it was going to be a Nintendo game. Um, and then it just wasn't. It couldn't be. Um, they couldn't, you know, execute their vision on a cartridge. So it's, it's interesting in that way.

No, they, they couldn't get anyone. They couldn't get shit. They couldn't get Crash. If Crash comes to Smash Bros., ladies and gentlemen, and that's possible. I mean, you know, that that's possible as well. But it's, you think that's the December announce? Oh my God, no. I don't think they would. I don't think they would do that. But there was a lot of rumors or conjecture that no one wanted or a lot of publishers and IP holders didn't want their, their characters involved in All-Stars because it wasn't a proven IP. And this says that if that was the case with Square and we don't know if it was or not, that they actually, you know, unlike All-Stars, they see a lot of prise in Smash. Of course they do because",

Um, and they just got Cloud in the, in, I won't even say the competitor, it's just the game that inspired all All-Stars in a way. So I, I think at the very least, this is an overt shot at Sony, um, to get one of their characters, a character. I mean, there's, there's really few characters that are more closely associated with PlayStation's history than Cloud. Um, but again, the conspiracy theorist in me kind of thinks that this means more than just, uh, than just getting. And I don't know if it's, I don't know that it's the, the Final Fantasy VII Remake necessarily because as far as I understand, that is a PlayStation first game.

Um, so I, I wonder if that might be a little more reasonable to assume than than, um, than the game being ported on. Yeah, you know, Smash has a weird history of kind of predicting what's going to happen and it doesn't necessarily like you're saying mean anything. You know, we saw Pit in Brawl and then we eventually saw the Kid Icarus game on on 3DS. But then we saw Ice Climbers still haven't seen them come back and do anything. No, they're still missing. So they are still missing. But there, there's a lot of stuff like that that it really doesn't mean anything.

Pac-Man games were on Nintendo, but that doesn't mean shit. Namco made the game. That's why that happened. I think that's why. I mean, well, that's what I'm, that's what I'm saying is that you didn't have to. There could have been deeper meaning in Snake or Pac-Man being on on the the systems except for the fact that there's just obvious reasons of why they probably were. Snake with his lineage and Pac-Man just being a, you know, Bandai Namco's like icon as Pac-Man. So of course they're going to shove him in there somewhere.

But again, there is a significant Nintendo Legacy. Like the original Street Fighter '49 was a Nintendo game. And so it's, it's, you know, that's an NES game. And then Street Fighter II was was at home on Super Nintendo. That's where everyone played the shit game because the Genesis version was so borked, you know, with the control scheme. So it was so again, there might be more to it or there might not. There clearly isn't with Street Fighter V because that's a PlayStation game. But and a PC game. But that made sense to me too.

And also they overtly, I mean, there was Final Fantasy VII music like, and they even showed the Final Fantasy VII Logo. Like it was built up to make it kind of look like Final Fantasy VII was coming in some form before Smash even happened. Usually Smash trailers start off with the the Smash like, like the fire burning thing. And in the Direct it didn't. In the trailer, if you watch on YouTube now, it does. But excuse me. Um, that's interesting because they usually always show that first. So they were trying to trick us. Um, I'm so excited about this.

You can't change your name on Sony because of technical limitations. You can't play his Ice Climber.
