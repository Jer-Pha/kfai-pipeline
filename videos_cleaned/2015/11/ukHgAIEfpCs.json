Jesus. Rough school bully, The Hulk. And then Joel is just plain Jane over here with his nice hair. Great. All right. Now do the same with the green deck. Yeah. Tim, you can do that. Grab me three from the top there and put them down there. All right. So we got, we got Joel who wants to be a hair stylist. Greg who wants to dog sled across the Arctic. The Hulk wants to dog.
