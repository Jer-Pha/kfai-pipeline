I didn't think you I thought you guys were going to make fun of it a little bit more. We went down that rabbit hole hard. Uh, this comes from our good friend T. Trak, oh, where over off Patreon of Kinda Funny. You go there and sponsor a topic. Yeah, you can if you say forward one more time. I say it now. I'm HTTP maybe S H H HTTP S. This is a long one. I'll pray for no. I'll read the whole thing. The entire plot was in the trailer. I get irritated, upset, and let down when a film comes out and the pertinent plot points are beat bopping and scatting all over the place. The most recent case I could think of was Jurassic World. They kept releasing long trailers full of giveaways. Does this bother you? Does this bother you guys when you watch a trailer? Yes, and the entire **** movie is in the trailer. It's the worst and it's so prevalent these days. The older trailers didn't do this when when",

They flipped the script on it and all of a sudden you couldn't you felt like you see everything. Well, I think I think it was also during the the transition from um having trailers that had heavy voice over to trailers that like when when that style of trailer went out, you could no longer like have catchy phrases that the guy could say, so you had to show more stuff. Yeah, and also I feel like and and I could be wrong on this, but I feel like there's just more **** trailers now.

Um, I think say the internet, right? Like before trailers were just before movies and then you'd be the TV spot. Yeah, but like now it's the trailer. People don't think of trailers as before movies. They think of it as when does it drop online? And that's why they are event things where there's multiple trailers for a movie. It was before it was standard to have, you know, the trailer and then like the launch trailer and then TV spots, usually three 30-second ones. Now it's like a **** **** ton. Yeah, no, I think it bothers me too.

Was the dinosaur wearing roller skates? That's how they that's how she's able to keep some speed. Dinosaurs all over the place. Like, okay, I'm getting the hang of this. These are these are rollerblades. I mean the **** right now, but old school roller skates are a little harder, uh, with the stopper on the front. You used to have to drag him, remember that? You couldn't stop. You just kind of drag him a little bit. Yeah, slow yourself. Skids are so stupid. I think it's annoying, but at the same time, I also think just don't watch them.

If you only if you see M.H., you know, five movies over the span of like of a few months, you might see that trailer depending on how they serve the trailer a couple times. That's fine. So, you know, just uh I think the the clear thing to do here, T. Trak, is just don't watch any TV. Don't watch any movies. Never. That is the downside, right? Is like, how do you avoid it? Like you want to be interested in a movie. Like I with Amazon now, right? Where I hop on and I want to watch a movie instantly or whatever. Kristine and I'll go in there and we'll go through it and they'll be like movies where it's like, 'Huh, this sounds all right.' And then it's the question of like, 'Well, do I roll the dice?

They'll act like you don't know, but like you know, you can piece it all together. God, yeah, you watch these ****. You're going to see that last shot of like the robot escaping from the **** prison. You're like, 'There it is.' The problem too, yeah, it's like when you're watching the the movie, then you start thinking back like piece by piece. You get to the point where you're like, 'All right, I still haven't seen this location, so that means that's where we're going.' And that kind of sucks. The last movie I saw that I hadn't seen any trailer for was Gone Girl. And going into the movie without knowing anything about it, I was like, 'This is **** great. What a great movie!'

Like there's no way that you don't know at least X amount of Star Wars just because people talking about it, you know? Or like every headline or every freaking thumbnail or screen cap or whatever of the trailers. Like that that alone gives **** away. So it's like I I like to buy into the hype because once the movie's out, the movie's out. So it's like that is a finite experience.

I guess for me, it depends on the movie, right? Like with Star Wars, I want I want all that to be out there so that I can choose to indulge if I want. I can choose to watch all the trailers. Like there's TV spot where someone uh that I think it was running last week where there was some other stuff that someone told me about. I was like, 'I don't want to watch that.

Yeah, but I feel like with Star Wars also, like they don't have the burden of having to tell you what this brand new franchise is. You kind of get it. You know, it's Star Wars. They could have just showed Star Wars and then just the **** just the Millennium Falcon just cruising for like 5 seconds and I'm like, 'I'm going to wait in.' They're having trouble starting it for a second. It's just kind of there. Just it's like slowly F and then it just goes up and says Star Wars. It's like, 'We're in.'

And uh it worked. People went and saw it. People liked it. It was good. Um, but I'm not going to lie, like there was nothing in Ant-Man that I watched that really wowed me because I had seen 90% of it in the trailers. And even any of like like that one great shot where you know, uh they're fighting miniature and like it's all this crazy explosions. Then it like stops for a second and it goes like normal person and the train hits and falls down. Just in the movie, you're like, 'I'm waiting for it. I'm waiting for it. Wait, there it is.'

I mean, it did in a lot of ways, but there was like I think what are the the best shots in the the whole movie of Avengers, which I don't want to spoil for people, but like they involve or they involve um Thor just like all of them together doing stuff. And it's like that stuff wasn't in the trailers. So it's like I remember seeing them being like, 'Oh, **** that's cool.' But every other Marvel movie, it's like the trailers are as good as a perfect example is Avengers: Age of Ultron, right? They showed like the last scene where they're defending the McGuffin. I can't even remember the center and all of them are like flying around it and like, you know, shit's happening.

I'm taking more chances on movies I've never heard of, but I like I I know this actor and I know that actress and they're in this thing and I've never seen this indie or whatever. And it's like, 'Okay, whatever. I'm not going to watch the trailer because it's like that's the worst is watching the trailer right before you watch the movie.' Well, no, I'm not going to do this.

If it's straight to DVD or in our case VHS or in my case Beta, um if it's straight to that, you know, it's ****, right? It's a B movie that didn't get funded and it has no one in it, right?

And again, it was on it was on HBO again the other day and I was like, 'The ****, it's a it's a good movie, man.' I just started watching it and kind of I watched like 30 minutes of it and then my brother-in-law was in town was like, 'Um, hey, Under Siege is on. We should watch that instead.' So we watched the entirety of Under. What was the one we were watching last night where Steven Seagal was kicking ass in a beard? God, what is that one called? That's a weirder one.

Yeah, this is I put Steven Seagal hand slap in the hand slap game on YouTube. Worst movie scenes of all time, episode one. I'm going to bet I'm going to guess that Seagal has On Deadly Ground. Onad is yeah, because I remember like after he beats the **** out ofy, oh, it was right after he beats the **** out of that guy, um he like teaches them a life lesson, which is pretty awesome, and then walks away.

So it's that way you just don't really know what's what you're getting involved in. Like I don't watch I watch almost no game trailers at all. Like at all. Unless you do on Colin and Greg. Yeah, like I've watched more movie trailers on Colin and Greg than I have like my entire life, you know? Like when I'm not in movie. Fascinating though that like you will you're more inclined to watch a movie trailer, a two-minute trailer for an hour and a half or two hour long film and you're like, 'I think I'll stay away from the 70 hour game that I'm about to indulge in. I'm not going to watch anything about that.' Like it's it's it's backward, right? Like you guys, we should we",

We should just stay **** radio silent on movies, but we're so conditioned to to like want to see that trailer, you know? That's said to play Devil's Advocate anyway. I do think that it's overstated sometimes how much a movie is spoiled in in trailers. The one the one example I can give, even though I didn't see the movie, I read the book was The Martian. Everyone was freaking out about The Martian spoiling the movie and I'm like, 'What are you like what are you talking about? The the the the the mission goes south like literally in the first two pages of the book. They're not spoiling anything. That's the **** movie.' Yeah, is the man being stranded on Mars.

It's not about how he got stranded on Mars. It's that he is stranded on Mars. That's the **** movie about. So sometimes people lose their minds not having any further context because I remember a lot of people being upset about that when we were watching the trailers and I'm like, 'I read this book and it's about what he does on Mars, which they don't really show. He lives. That's not a surprise. He's alive on Mars. That's what the movie's about.' You know? So I'm like, 'So everyone's like, 'Oh, you know, this disaster happens, all this stuff.' I'm like, 'Yeah, this is literally the epilog.' Everyone was upset in Furious 7 when it showed the car going from building to building. 'You're spoiling it!' It's like, 'But no one knew there was a second building that they jumped to.' No, see, in that way, they actually that was **** awesome. They actually used that trailer. Yeah, it was",

They used a trailer to actually punch that joke through in that moment through rather and it actually worked well because I was like, 'Oh, here's that stupid scene. What the ****? There's another building doing it again. Another building.' But I'm sympathetic to the to the plight though of spoilers and stuff like that because I've talked in the past about how spoilers have actually gotten me into things. Uh uh it when I got into Lost in college, it was because a friend of mine, um Brandon, told me and my girlfriend at the time about the numbers and all this kind of stuff. It was after season 3 had already aired and I was like, 'That sounds awesome.' And then so he told me about the island and the numbers and the Dharma Initiative and all this",

So I got into that because of the spoilers. I wouldn't have known if not for, you know, 4 8 15 16 23 42, which I'll always remember that. It's that it's that I was why why that is. I used to have a shirt when I first worked at IGN. I had the numbers on. I used to love Lost and then I realized it was awful. Um, yeah, I was going to say there's no way to spoil Lost because nothing **** happens in Lost because they don't know what it is. They don't know what the hell is going on. There's a smoke monster. What is it? No one knows. And then the wasted episodes anyway. And the random characters like the scientist, Paolo, Lies, yeah, Po, yeah, that one, that classic.

I literally was like, 'Is this like some some pretty people on an island?' Like I'm like, 'This what the **** is this sh?' Like I had no idea what this was. Like I don't care, you know?

I'm sure it's going to be great, you know? Um, you know, Final Fantasy 15's near and and there's a bunch of **** out there and I'm just like, 'I'll just play it when it comes out. I'm sure it'll be great.' You know? So are you sure it'll be great Final Fantasy 15? No, I'm not sure it's gonna be great at all. I mean, even Tales of Zestiria. I mean, that's I was looking forward to that game. I played it in Japan some years ago, but um I didn't watch anything or read anything about it at all. That was my least favorite thing to do at IGN was to preview games because I was like, 'I don't want to I like I don't want to play this article size. I want to get into it when it's ready to go.'

Um, so I think some people, much like the Black Friday debate, there has to be some responsibility taken on the side of the consumer that they subject themselves to this **** and it and it sends the signal that this is what they want and they do. So sure. So I just I just refrain from doing any of that stuff. Yeah, you got you got to self-police, right? Similar to the exactly like the the the Black Friday debate, right? Is like it's of course it's great. Go buy something if you want to buy something. It's the people that take it to the extreme that that that that minority of people uh that kind of make everyone else look bad if that makes sense, right? And it's the same with these trailers. Like you don't have to watch the trailers. I don't need to watch. I know there's a Japanese Star Wars",
