Tim, your girlfriend lives in Philadelphia. Yeah, you don't stop taking resum\u00e9s. So Nick, yes sir. Today's question comes from 20-year-old Darren. 20, got it. Darren says, hey guys, what's the best way to get a girlfriend? I've been having some trouble. That's a broad question. It is, it is. That is a broad question. Well, Darren, um I think about I think the best way to get a girlfriend is like this: become an awesome person. And I I don't mean that in like you're not an awesome person right now, but you're 20, right? And so I think the importance right now in your life should be less about getting someone else in your life and more about making your life what you want it to be eventually. Like I always say, when you're in your 20s, you should be working very very hard toward being the person you want to be in your 30s. And the most important part about that is the fact",

And the most important part about that is the fact that you need to not try to be someone that's attractive to women. Try to be someone that you want to be, and that will be attractive to people. A big problem that I think a lot of people fall into around like guys around the the high school through early college levels of their lives is like the guys that aren't getting the girlfriends left and right. You know, we're not talking about the cool kids and you know, all boys, the quarterback and the baseball players, football players, basketball players, the water polo players, the water polo players, or the volleyball players, the volleyball players. Yeah, they're getting they're getting it all. So the thing with that though is there's there's all these people that aren't getting that and they're like they are the normal ones, you know, like that's I think the most",

So the thing with that though is there's there's all these people that aren't getting that and they're like they are the normal ones, you know, like that's I think the most important thing. But they get kind of stuck in this rut where they they start making excuses and start feeling like what they're doing, A, that they're not doing a good enough job, and B, that everyone else is doing something that is against them. So it's like how many times have you heard, oh, you know, I'm just I'm not I don't need a girlfriend. Like there's no one good enough for me, you know? Or oh, you know what, it's the always the the nice guys. I'm a nice guy and I'm never going to get a girlfriend because they only like the bad guys. It's like don't make excuses. Don't you know, don't try to put it as if the girls aren't good enough for you. Just you need to just be you. Work on that and then you'll find somebody. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to go, you know, I want to do this. I think I'm going",

You're going to go, you know, I want to do this. I think I'm going to go do this. I'm passionate about this subject. Maybe it's film, maybe it's writing, maybe it's math, maybe it's this, whatever, it doesn't matter. You're going to go do that. You're going to invest yourself in it. You're going to get lost in it. You're going to immerse yourself in it. You're going to start to have success in it. And I guarantee that's when you're going to meet someone that's in that same field or has common interests and you're going to click. And that's what's going to happen. And it's always it's it's the weirdest thing because the world always works counterintuitive to itself, right? When you want a girlfriend, you can't get a girlfriend. The second you don't want a girlfriend is when you find the girl that you might be with for the rest of your life. That is entirely correct. To take it",

That is entirely correct. To take it in a different direction, you know, if you really do want one and it you know, it's not enough to just work on yourself. You do want to to find somebody or at least try different things. You need to put yourself out there. You know, a lot of people are like, where should I go? And it's like they're like, oh, where besides bars or clubs or this or that? It's like, well, that's where people go to do these things. So it's like those kind of are the answers, you know? And nowadays we got online dating, Tinder, all those. You got online dating, you have community events. That's also a huge big thing too. I've seen people in our community that have like become really good friends because they come to our events or they're going to Comic-Con and they're like, I don't have anyone here that's into what I'm into.

Yeah, exactly. And that should always be the goal. More things happen and that's just great. Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, this has been Love & Sex Stuff.
