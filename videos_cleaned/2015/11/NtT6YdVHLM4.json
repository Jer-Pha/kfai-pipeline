I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the pride of Long Island and the man who did the guides for Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, Colin Moriarty, having like Vietnam War flashbacks here. Thank you. Yeah, really just thinking about New Vegas in general, the one that broke you, the one that totally broke me. All right, well, I want to know how that compares to this in one second. Over here, you know her from youtube.com/Steimer Steimer.com, it's Kristine Steimer, also the woman who reviewed for IGN Fallout New Vegas. I did, I did. We have a Fallout exam that broke you too. That was when you're like, I don't, because I had to play it like they gave it to us on such short notice that I had to play it for the exam, so I was playing it for 4 hours and uh, that broke you.

We are going to sit here and talk about the game. We will not put a score on it, but you will know if we like it or don't like it by the end of it. Also, as I said in the beginning, this is spoiler-free. Now, of course, I think spoiler-free reviews are a load of BS. We have to talk about little bits of specific, so if you want to know nothing about the game, you'd want to leave right now. But I'm not, we're not going to spoil main story threads. I might mention a character name here or there, but that's not spoiler. I have a, I will guarantee you that the launch trailer that came out this last week was more spoilery than this video will be.

Yeah, I had already seen them by then. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's a good point. Let's start there. We've had the game roughly a week. We all started in on Saturday. Kristine's had about half that time. Yeah, how far are you, Kristine? I don't know how far I am. I'm like level 15. Okay, so that's a good place. Um, and I kind of just, I'm meandering. I'm not like you seem to like really be going forward in the story and fly through where I'm like, I, I'm like, oh no, I still haven't even gotten to this other part that you got to like, yeah, but you keep, you're doing the thing where Kristine plays RPGs very methodically, very much like Colin, actually.

I'm like, I don't even think he went up over here and like found these. Probably did. Now, come on. These things, I don't think you did. I'm going to show you later. All right, fine. Colin, how far into the game are you? Uh, I'm level 15 as well, but I'm, I'm 15 hours in. Okay. I'm deliberately playing it slowly. Good. No, I mean, you waited years and years for this game.

But like, I used to, when I get really excited about a game, I'd play it and play it and play it and play it and play it 10 1. Yeah. And like, I don't, why do I want to do that anymore? I, yeah, we've been waiting for this, so I play like a few hours a day, maybe. Got it. And then I just go read a book or like watch TV or something. Like on Sunday, I just watched football. I didn't play the game at all. So I should be further than I am considering how long we've had the game, but do what you want to. You're savoring it exactly right.

So I, what I'm doing is I, I feel it's going to sound different. I'm savoring in a different way, whereas I think what Fallout 4 is great at right now is that I love the narrative thread of it. I love what your motivation is. I love what I'm off doing and I'm really connected to that story and that character and what's happening, my character, I guess.

I just don't get it yet, you know what I mean?

See, my thing is like, I, so we're of course talking about, and you've seen it, Fallout 4, you get to build your own communities, build your own houses, build your own, uh, build your own like tiny settlements basically, right? Exactly. And so when you're in there and you're looking at your HUD and you go over them, it shows how happy people are and like how full they are. And then there's like defenses.

Just the one that's really, I have basically just one that's populated and the other, it's, they're not annoying. I'll get to them eventually for the trophies. But I love the scrapping ability because I'm such a hoarder. I take everything and then I drop it on my companion and I go get more and then I go drop it off. And like last night, I'm, you know, I'm hitting on the main quest. It was like, oh, I don't know, you got to build this thing and it's, it might take some time.

I'd rather them spend those, you know, you know, allocate those resources during development to make, make the game bigger. But, um, the game's already very big as it is. Say, I was looking at his map. I was like, oh ****, like, I don't know why, but it didn't even looking at mine, it didn't feel as big as when I looked at yours for some reason, because you had a lot more.

It's Fallout 4 is essentially Fallout 3 with a new location, prettier graphics and just more like minutia. And they just removed some systems and added some systems, minor tweaks like here and there. It's a very familiar game like that. And that's, and that's, that's both, it's, it's, that's both good and bad for. I was going to, so like right now, do you feel like you can compare the two instead? You like one better than the other or anything like that? No, I don't want, I don't want to compare them.

And, and Fallout 4 compared to say The Witcher 3 or Dying Light, which are other open world games that came out this year, certainly way uglier, um, certainly, uh, way stiffer, uh, certainly, um, you know, a lot of presentational issues that are like very backwards that, that are, that I actually wouldn't have cared about this time last year that I actually care a lot more about now. Um, so there are, because you've seen other games do it better. Yeah, there are. Yeah, definitely. I mean, there, you know, there's, I'm not, I don't care about the graphical fidelity so much.

Fallout 3 looks much worse, but in your head, that's how it's aged. It's like when you think of an N64 game and then you play that N64. Yeah, so it's, it's, it's just one of those situations where I think Fallout 4 is like a fantastic game so far. Yeah, uh, it's certainly got its issues though. It's certainly far from perfect. And, and I think some of its, some of the tweaks that they made to Fallout 4 were unnecessary, um, and disappointing to me. So what are the ones that pops to mind to you specifically? The way you level up, um, I think is really kind of stupid. And, and like, I don't like it. You pointed at him when he said, I was pointing at him because I've heard him say this before.",

Yeah, um, so you can level up your Luck by just leveling like dumping a point in when you level up, whereas before it like really meant something. You had to go, basically, you could only raise them, you pick out your stats at the beginning of the game and then from then on, you can only find Bobbleheads and that's how you, right, exactly.

Oh, really? Really? I find it so useful. And, uh, to me, it's just like, okay, that's cool. I like that. But then the minutia of like using like the whole grid is like, Jesus, this is overwhelming, you know, like, sure, like, I, I don't even remember like what I was doing the last time I leveled up and stuff like that. It's maybe it's my own problem or whatever, but there's just way too many options. And, and I just, and like, it just like, what does it remind me of? Is it overwhelming? Is that, yeah, in a way, like it, it, it, what was the game where it might have been Dying Light where I'm like, all of this sucks.

And I do like how, how it's behind a wall where it's like, all right, you need a Charisma five plus level 19, uh, and maybe even some other statistics in order to level this thing up. But I liked the way that you just got skill points in Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas and then just disperse them however you wanted amongst like 0 different things.

The only other system that they, that I, I was disappointed in is like the lack of like, yeah, the lack of guns, no longer no degrading, no combining. Like, I'm just like, so I'm like, I, this was clearly focus tested. And maybe not this particular game, but clearly they got a lot of feedback on that last time that fixed this. And I, to me, I was like, that is realistic to me because that's the reason why, well, now every Super Mutant carries like a pistol and I don't need to carry any of them except for the first one I find. So why even put them in there, you know, unless I want to break them down for parts, whatever. So or sell them. So it's, there's some inconsistencies and incongruencies in",

I think that's, I think that's super clever. So if you're not paying attention, you get radiation and then your, it begins working backwards on your health bar. It'll be red going into your green and you can only get as healthy as till you touch the red. Then you have to take red away and go over there or go to a doctor. I'm the opposite where I, I like, I guess I am the focus group. Well, I, I liked combining and fixing my guns before to do that. But I like this leveling system a lot actually, because now I feel like it's attainable that I can get in there and I can go and like, for me, it's very much that it's a lot more visual.

And, uh, you could just blast the **** out of anyone with this weapon. Weap awesome. It was, it was ridiculous. It totally broke the game. And people went and got it like later if you got the DLC and then you can go around and like fight all the massive Super Mutants or whatever, uh, and the Deathclaws and whatnot. But I like that it's like the antithesis for me now where I'm like, I'm struggling a little bit and I'm kind of trying to sustain the struggle because",

I crouch the entire **** game. And so like, so I'm invisible. And, and, and I'm, I'm like kind of picking off Super Mutants.
