What about the stick-in-the-mud? My God, that's disgusting. Nick, what about swimming in the pond? I mean, what about the guppy? I'll think about it. What about the stick? He got me. Absolutely not. No, too far. You always go too far. Today, lay it on me. Today's question comes from twenty-year-old Jerry, Jerry, Jerry says, \"Hi guys, my girlfriend keeps telling me there are things that are off-limits during sex, but she won't tell me what they are. WTF? What did I do?\" I think you need a girlfriend, Jerry. Yeah, I don't think you need to figure out what's off-limits. Here's what you don't do. Don't just don't do by trial and error, please, for the love of God. That's how people... Why doesn't jail? I mean, as always, we have the rules on the show. Rule number negative 1: consent. Yeah, rule number 3 or 4, I'm not sure. We always talk about communication. You gotta talk to her, you",

You gotta talk to her, you gotta see what's okay. It works the other way too. You should talk to you if there's anything you guys want to try, bring it up, talk about it. The question is, what's off-limits during sex? The real question should be, what am I allowed to do during sex? It's obviously gonna be different for each person, right? So your significant other is gonna have certain limits that you're not, you're never supposed to cross, right? But you really do need to clearly define those. For instance, Tim and I, zero limits, no limits. I only live my life zero limits at the time. Yeah, me too. Mm-hmm. Man, I can't even imagine it. No, I would be down for that. No, I'd be down for that. No, I know there's no us, we're just business, but you know, we've talked to our significant others and they know that, oh no, my wife has limits. Hmm, yeah.",

Yeah, yeah, but I mean, I get that, but as long as you know that, as long as she's told you she just wants, I mean, potatoes and you're just gonna, you're gonna, you know, not switch it up, you're not gonna bring her Taco Bell. Okay, maybe ever met like, have you ever been with a girl who had like one thing she just would not do? Yes, yes, I think every girlfriend I've had up to like Caroline, they've always had some something that they're like, nah, we're not doing that. I'm, I was like, all right, thank you for telling me. Now I know that's what's awesome. I think so. I'll put the peanut butter away. Mm-hmm. I need to use that. Okay, that's fine. But I do it, you gotta do it. Well, my girl now that peanut butters moment out, she like that sweet sweet your peanut butter. No shame. No, with jelly she like",
