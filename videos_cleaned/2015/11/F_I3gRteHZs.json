Now why are we doing this, man? Uh, I don't know. We're doing this because of the Kinda Funny Extra Life stream that's happening this weekend. Hello? Didn't know either. You guys don't listen to anything. I actually said that because I heard say we were joining, but this weekend we're play. Think we have, you think, you think we're training right now because we have a chance in hell and beating anyone in the community this weekend? Uh, let's call it that. Have a 0% chance of winning this weekend. We're playing against you guys in the community. If you want to play with us, go to the Kinda Funny forums, go to the Extra Life threads and uh, sign up there. It's going to be a fun old time. We got to change some stuff. Stop. Oh, I, oh **** yeah, I'm glad we're doing this because I don't know if we've done a Let's Play this one-on-one. Maybe we, we may have, but I",
