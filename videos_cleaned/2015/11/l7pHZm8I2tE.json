I have two things to say before we get going, non-sequiturs. Sure. The first thing is that last week on the podcast, yeah, I blamed Tim for bringing up Star Wars in a conversation, got mad at him for it, but I brought it up. Now, the intention behind what I was saying at the time was that he had reiterated what we were talking about with Star Wars, and then I was saying, well, that's actually a bad example for you to bring up, but I had brought it up, and it made it seem like I was yelling at Tim for something he didn't do.
