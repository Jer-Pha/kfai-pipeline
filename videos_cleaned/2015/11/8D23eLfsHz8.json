My Gamescast topic is what video games have brought out the most emotion in you while playing? Thanks. I'm interested in hearing you answer this. Tim, Colin and I talk about this stuff all the time. I mean, I have so many and the thing is, emotion doesn't necessarily mean sadness. I think a lot, a lot of people kind of, you know, put those two things together. We talk about things like Journey and, you know, uh, Last of Us and talk about Walking Dead a lot, Gone Home and all that.

And it's like, yeah, those are for the games I've played of that, those are definitely emotional experiences. But for me, like the most emotion I've ever felt during a game, I would say is Yoshi's Island. First game I ever beat. That was an emotional moment. Yeah, but the the final boss fight in that, I remember it being so epic and feeling so grand and uh, just like it was different than the rest of the game. And like Baby Bowser turns giant. He's like in the the the **** like way, way out there. And like the Super Nintendo's using some effect that like I hadn't seen before. And I was like, what the **** is going on? I remember being overwhelmed with like, it felt epic. The emotion of just like, holy ****, this is intense. And um, it was just a **** Yoshi game, you know?

Choosing your starting Pok\u00e9mon, choosing which Evolution Eevee turns into, um, where are you going to use the Master Ball? Pok\u00e9mon felt like it was my life. It felt like just as important to me as going to school and getting good grades to get into a better school to get a job to, you know what I mean? Like every single choice felt like it had so much uh, resonance in my in my entire life because all my friends were talking about the same things. All my friends were making the same decisions and we had to make make sure that all of our decisions kind of correlated so we can trade each other and and, you know, do all that type of stuff.

Um, I think the The Sniper Wolf in Metal Gear Solid, that's what I was talking about when it goes back to me and, you know, I talk about Metal Gear being a turning point in my life in terms of what I I when I figure out what video games could be or where they were going kind of thing. And yeah, I always go back to that, you know, it's me and Po in my basement playing that on a summer night, right? And it's like two teenagers sitting there and we're just like totally enraptured as like she's saying goodbye and Otacon comes up crying and like we're both trying not to get choked up while we watch this.

Holy ****. And I mean, the reason it was is because they treated it like a movie. There's the multiple aspects going on, the music swelling, everything was edited and cut perfectly. Like that wasn't so much gameplay as much as it was an interactive experience. But like they ****, they played with my emotions so much and they I felt exactly what they wanted me to feel. And that was four games of buildup to that moment. And that game specifically, every single thing you did led to that. And like it was overwhelming, you know? I remember after it stopped, I wanted to save and just redo it again just to be like, holy ****, like show people, you know, that's the best when you're playing something, you know, this is awesome, you",

For me, like those awe-struck moments, right? There's always one in the Batman games from from Rocksteady, right? When you're going, when I remember when uh, I remember when and then I immediately go, wait, which one was it? I believe it was, yeah, the original Arkham Asylum when I was playing that for review, right? And you get dosed with Scarecrow gas, right? And you turn the corner and you are young Bruce Wayne and you're like walking down the hallway and your parents are there dead of the thing.

And then Arkham Knight, no spoilers, you know, there's still things where all of a sudden it's like, holy ****, like I it it seemed like every time a new one came out, they would lull you into that sense of, yep, it's it's Batman, you're punching and reversing and this and gliding. And then all of a sudden, here's this crazy easy thing you didn't expect them to do. And you sit there and you're like slack-jawed watching or playing it, you know what I mean? The same thing even with Fallout, again, no spoilers, but like there's this one quest I went on and I don't know if everybody gets it or what, but like you it's like, you know, it's going to be this thing, it's death-defying mission d and you suit up and you're going and",

And it's a part of the game that looks like nothing else. And you're just going and going, going. And it's just like, as I'm doing, I'm like, this is **** awesome, you know what I mean? Like this is not what I expected to happen in this game in this moment on this mission. And then you like, there's spoilery stuff all over there, but yeah, you know, it's just cool. No, I mean, something a moment like that for me was surprisingly in Twilight Princess. Like there's everyone talks about Ocarina of Time and Hyrule Fields and all that stuff.

It's like, it wasn't, but that was the same thing with Ocarina of Time. People always talk about Hyrule Field, yeah, but for me like the moment in the touchdown crazy moment of that is when you jump forward in time for the first time and you're, you know, Teen Link or whatever and you open that those doors and they had done such a great **** job of setting up what like the town square looked like and how lively and bright and vibrant and fun and light, you know what I mean? Light in terms of brightness and then light in terms of character and like emotion, right? And you open it up and it's **** mummies and it's",

That they totally, you don't even when somebody's setting something up in a game and you don't even know it till you get there and then like there's the flip, you're like, oh, that's why this was like that. Yeah, man. Uh, but the the moment that I didn't expect from the game was in Twilight Princess, the boss fight. Um, I don't remember who what the b fingers, he's got his hands out like this, but it was like, it was when you get the hook, the dual hook shots and you're like **** Spider-Man in around and you're fighting this like giant not Dragon, but like big bird thing.

Like I can't believe that this is in this game. Yeah, yeah. Um, and I there's just overwhelming emotion with these moments that like I'll just never forget. And you know, Smash Bros. I have a million of them, sure. Yeah, well, I mean, that's the all I always talk, I've written about it. It's arguably my most favorite not or famous non-review from my IGN right, is how Infamous affected me when I was going through my divorce or whatever, right? And why I'm so connected to that.

But like Trish's final words, you're like, holy ****, like this is so **** touching, you know what I mean? Of like she's like this, her dying words are, tell me, is good, good, Cole, right? That she wants me to go on and save people and I'm doing the right thing. It's like, ****, that's awesome, you know what I mean?

And like the end of Final Fantasy X was one of the first times where there was like a big buildup to a, I mean, it's a death, it's it's a weird death, but it's a death. And when Tidus **** like goes to hug Yuna and like disappears through her and like just jumps off the the ship like disappearing into like cuz he's a **** dream or whatever because that game's weird. Um, I remember being like, holy ****, like video games are making me sad, yeah, you know? Like I feel sad that these characters aren't going to be together.

Yeah, like playing through the game, I love I mean, I love that game so much. Uh, but when we playing, I didn't know that towards the end of the game, you like leave the beautiful looking stuff and go the Behind the Walls all stuff. And that for some reason, it hit me in a in a very creepy way where I was like, it felt like a horror game to me at that point. And like it scared me more than most horror games do. Interesting.

But then Portal 2, especially with Wheatley, once you get them involved in how genius the humor is in that, right? Where if you sit there and like Wheatley keeps talking to you and he just wants you to say apple or whatever and he keeps like doing it. And like if you just let him go, Stephen Merchant just goes and goes and goes stuff, right? And like those are games I sit there and think about like, yeah, having fun with in terms of laughing, you know what I mean? Like moments we remember in terms of emotions or whatever, it's, you know, stirring up there, having a good time at that point. Yeah, man, emotions are crazy.

But playing Resident Evil for the first time, **** dogs just like even in the glass, no, no, no, no, not even through the **** glass. I'm talking about just the **** dogs in the intro. Like that like zombie dogs, period. I was a little kid and that was scary as ****. And then the first zombie that turns around like that iconic first shot, oh my God, that's nightmares. See, it's similar to me like or similar to you like talk on emotions like how I when I first went in, I Gone Home, we talk about all the time and how, you know, I went hug Christine afterwards and D.

And then I like I'd go side, there'd be a doorway and I'd come up to the side of it and peek my head back around and keep going because I'm like, I'm gonna I'm gonna trigger this ghost somehow. Where is it gonna pop up? Da da da, you know what I mean? And it doesn't happen.

Braid's another one for me like in terms of like going into it thinking one thing and like, my God, that shit's just, you saw the soldier boy video and you're like, oh, I just rewind time with this kid. Great. Exactly. Um, and a weird one for me, Star Fox 64, the when you beat it on hard, you get the special ending, then Fox's dad comes back and like, I was like, oh my God. And I take the the story of Star Fox way too seriously. Good for. I was always super into it and thought it was **** really cool.

I think always about uh, wrestling games. And I've told my wrestling stories of chasing him down. But like the one that I don't talk about too much, right? Is just like, I get to Mizzou.

Flower's emotional, but it also has a a more overt story, I think, you know what I mean? As opposed to Journey where I'm like, I don't even know what this game's. It's about death, but like, I don't know. Like, I don't know. I I I just remember like crying when I was playing it and I like at the end, it's just like a whole thing.

Uh, when the twins kill themselves to save you is like a really um, although, you know, that's you'll find out more later, but at that time, you think that they commit suicide and and uh, they saved the team and it's like super, you know, the beauty of those games of",

And they're just stand and like they turn into stone and the walls stop. And the entire party is just sitting there being like, what the ****? These like 10-year-old kids just killed themselves in front of us, you know? And it's it's uh, Porom and Palom are like some of my favorite characters of all time.

I think there's a lot of death and **** up **** in that game. There's you you start the game came out committing an act of terrorism like and you have no choice but to do it. And um, that's what that's like what sets, you know, uh, Cecil or Ceil, depending on how you want to say it, and Kain on this like this this, you know, they go to this, they go to this village to deliver a package.
