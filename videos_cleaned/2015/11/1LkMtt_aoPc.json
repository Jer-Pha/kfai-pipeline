As always, I'm Tim Gettys, joined by the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. Hi, hello. Uh, oh man, today's going to be a good one. Is it? Yeah, there's a lot of research put into this one, more so than normal, I would say. You go to Wikipedia. By that, I meant there's a lot of copy and pasting of articles that I'm going to have to read at some point, but there was a lot, there was a lot of facts and details that I didn't want to just kind of be like saying words and not really know what I'm talking about. Instead, I'm going to say someone else's words and they definitely knew what they were talking about. Got so I'll sound a lot smarter. Gotcha. Smart. You know what I should do? I should just go back and just read all of Colin's articles just aloud. Then I'm just like, yeah, like is like old ones. Mhm. Why the hell would anybody want to know about what's happened",

You probably guys don't remember that when Batman. Batman didn't debut New Game Plus. Yeah, he did. Batman invented. Batman himself invented New Game Plus. Lucius Fox invented it. What's the earliest game you remember New Game? Say my first, the first one I ever encountered, it was Final Fantasy X. I know it was before that, but that was the first time I came across. Chrono Trigger was the first game I, I mean, my mind that I remember having something called New Game Plus. Yeah, but I, I mean, Zelda had, you know, well, Second Quest and stuff like that. But yeah, I remember, I mean, I think in Chrono Trigger it is called New Game Plus, and I wonder if that's where. Could be wrong about that, but I think so.

Yeah, in between. So like in between '94 and 2003. Yeah. Um, ****, I don't know. Yeah, I don't. Let us know in the comments the first game that, uh, you had a New Game Plus in. It's an interesting question. Yeah, just an interesting piece of trivia. Mhm. It can't be Chrono Trigger. Chrono Trigger couldn't have made it up, but that's, that's definitely like the earliest one I remember. I mean, it could have. Yeah, the term. I'm not saying the idea of playing the game again, because like you said, The Legend of Zelda, the original one had. Mario, a good example. Yeah, The Legend of Zelda's really is a New Game Plus. M.

Uh, so yeah, end of the topic. What have you been talking about that you can talk about? Halo. Played Halo with Christine and man, I'll tell you what, Tim, I know it's just not going to shock anybody on the internet. I just don't get Halo, really. I've played every Halo co-op and I've never had a great time, really. Yep. I play them. They're fun enough. It's okay. I'm doing something together, but it's just like, and like this one, the story sounded cool and I still think the story is cool. I'm like, Christine says we're six chapters in. She's like, we have to finish it. We're almost half, we're halfway through. And I'm like, that doesn't sound right, but she says it is. She's looked at her",

I think it's fun. I, I, is it? Yeah, I'm a couple missions in. The problem I'm having is my Xbox is like flipping out. So right. Yeah, your controller keeps disconnecting. Yeah, every couple minutes my controller will disconnect and it's the worst. But that didn't stop me from forcing myself playing. Uh, we've been trading off a little bit just because it's, it's the most annoying thing in the world. Um, but no, I was just playing the single player thing, trading off the single old school saying. I see what you're saying. So you do this level, I'll do that level, which I mean, I want to be positive about this game, but that's the biggest negative I have to say about it is I can't believe there's not",

That's Halo, man. And I get that, you know, modern games and, you know, things change, hard to run it. Yeah, and I get all that, but it's like, that sucks because that's what I like the most about Halo, specifically the campaign. I like co-op split screen, being in the same room with them playing. And it's like, I, I enjoy it so much that I was like, all right, how do I get two Xboxes, two Halo 5s and like, let's get two TVs in the same room. Let's do it. But then it got to the point I was like, that's, I just don't have the time nowadays to like make that all happen. Um, did you get another Xbox? You have two Xbox. I thought isn't there one kicking on your house still or is it just the one? Just the one. Yeah, that's what sucks. I sold that Goa. There you go from. Um, but I mean, it good just the the setup of",

Now it's like, all right, I have real things to do. Sure. Instead of, you know, setting up a ridiculous gaming setup. Get in the TV, Tim. HDMI cord, TV and the Xbox. It's set up pretty much. I mean, think, think of the cost of that, Greg. Think the cost. Fine. The time isn't a thing. Whatever. Colin and I were watching football out there. I brought up that second screen. I was sitting out there playing games. Yeah, but yeah, Halo 5, it just doesn't click for me. And I, and I've, I've always thought it was like, maybe it's just not this Halo, you know what I mean? But I think it's just the fact that since I didn't have an affinity for Halo 1 or 2, they were games that I, my friends were playing, but I wasn't playing",

But I knew how important they were, kind of thing, that I just don't think I have that built-in, here's the foundation of why I, I care about Halo. And since I don't have that, I play this game and I'm just like, all right, just run around shooting ****. Like, what's happening? All right, what's going on? Halo's one of those things where the gameplay is just fun to me. I like it. The gameplay is annoying to me. Hey, here's this gun I really like. Oh, out of ammo. Better pick up one of these **** alien guns and shoot until I get back to the gun I like. Like, why? I just run around with the gun I like all the time. I don't know. I think that's part of the, the fun of, and again, this is coming from someone that has enjoyed the past Halo games, so I like that it plays like a",

I have no, I, I've played the past Halo games, but never enjoyed them, really. Right. So I don't have that like, I enjoyed this part of it. Now it's, it's compounded by the fact of it's like, I'm playing with Christine who immediately jumps to Laura Bailey to play as her or whatever. So I'm kicked into being Lock or whatever and has a shitty **** gun too. And I get to play as Chief once in a while. He's got a good gun. But then inevitably now I got to pick up the **** needle dick here and do this stupid thing. But again, I think that's part of the design and like, whether or not you like that, that's, you know, up to you. But like for me, I like the, the weapon management kind of system. I mean, it's not like it's that deep of a thing, but just like understanding how much ammo you",

I mean, it's not like it's that deep of a thing, but just like understanding how much ammo you have and knowing like the, the power weapons versus just the alien weapons, which most of the time aren't as good, at least the ones you find in the campaign and stuff. So I, I've always enjoyed that. My biggest thing is in terms of the story so far, I'm not like in love with it. I like that it's not the Cortana. Uh, I think we did maybe three, three missions in. Um, and it's just like, I, I like that there's not the same old Cortana, like same old thing. But it is kind of weird that there's this, the teams you're with, but there's not really a backstory. Like unless you read the books and like know the stuff. And like my friends that I'm sitting in the same room with, like they know, so they're like, oh, this is cool, this is cool. But it's like, I don't know that. So it's like the game kind of assumes that I know more",

So it's like the game kind of assumes that I know more than I do. And I think that's a problem. Otherwise, there're just four people on my team. Right. You know, and the other thing is, at least in the single player, the AI of my teammates wasn't always great. Like I'd tell them to do things and then they wouldn't. Um, but I think that's a case by case basis. But, uh, I'm having fun with the game and I think it's good. And I think that, uh, I mean, if the sales have anything to say about it, like people are super into it. Like we were seeing today that it broke the record, broke the record, man. For's the, no one really knows. No one knows what copies are, but like we know that it broke the record that they won't say. Yeah, it's so annoying.

Why does everyone do this? Yeah, so annoying. Dress it up. Activision does the same **** with Destiny as Jason Schreier pointed on in Kotaku. Like every time they've never said how many copies the game sold. Yeah. Um, yeah, I know. I watch Greg play Halo 5 quite a bit. And, and, uh, you know, I was a fan of Halo 1 and Halo 2 and, and, but I wasn't a fan of their story. Like I, I don't, the, the, I like the, like the gameplay. Those games, they, they were really unique and special at the time, especially. I think there just wasn't many games. There weren't many competent, you know, console shooters in the early 2000s.

Halo to me always and the reason I'm not engaged in it anymore, just from the an outsider's point of view, is that it's just, it's a very ster, it looks like a very sterile sci-fi universe in a way. Like I don't, it just doesn't vibe with me. I was, I was talking to when I watched Greg play for maybe an hour and, uh, just so I can get a little taste of it. I'm like, this is just, I just don't, I don't, I don't get it from an aesthetic point of view even. Like I, like I don't, I don't get it. I don't get what this, like what the necessarily the, the, I understand why people like it. I understand people like the gameplay. The multiplayer has a lot of feelings, like nostalgic feelings.

I played all those Killzone games on, you know, PS3 or two of them on PS3 and, you know, obviously the PS2 one, um, was supposed to be like the Halo killer and back in the day, clearly it wasn't. But I, I had the same, I had a, I had a similar yet different problem with those games, which was like, this is so gray and black and brown and **** boring, you know, like, and with with Halo and I kind of, you know, grudgingly went through those games so I can like at least talk about them on on Podcast Beyond back in the day.

Everything feels like it's like a set piece and it's just this thing that I'm running through to shoot things. But that's just, but that's just my perspective from an an outside. I did not play the game other than trying to use a vehicle really quick because I was laughing at Greg not being able to do it. And then I realized the controls was really bad. Well, yeah, but, uh, but so take my my opinions with the grain of salt. I mean, I'm sure the game plays fantastically. See, I don't even think it does.

Like Alfredo, when I learned Titanfall and he taught me, like, I was like, I want to be good at Titanfall because I like Titanfall. Teach me your ways, Alfredo Diaz. He sat me down and, you know, built me from the ground up. He's like, here's Bumper Jumper. That's the one to use. And I'm like, great, thank you. The Bumper Jumper in here has no iron sights on the triggers. So if I want to use Bumper Jumper, I still have to click in the stick to go or no, it's click in the stick, I believe, to go iron sight ever. It's like, this is terrible. Or no, it isn't stick.

Like kind of like everything else is based on on how that feels to me. So it's like I play all these other games and my biggest complaint is it doesn't feel like Halo. And in terms of the look and stuff, I love the look. I love the, the way that the, the enemies look compared to your characters.

And like the war going on between like the Elites and the Jackals and all this stuff. Like it's all just the little details that as you play through the games, you kind of just pick up on and like the different looks between them all and all that.

I, I like that it's, it's very linear. It's designed like there's this course. That course is obviously to ride a Warthog through, you know, this, there's this jump that is, it's the point, you know. Yeah. Um, playing through when you play Super Metroid and there's the escape scene in the beginning. It's like that is designed that way, you know, all the, the things that you face and stuff. That ship, why would it be designed that way? It's designed that way just to make the escape fun. And like in Halo, there's constantly those moments.

But well, with this game in particular, I'm interested to see when games get really hyped up, it takes people a while to gain distance from them in order to like kind of critique them in in different ways. Not necessarily so it's not to say that the initial critique is wrong, because I think The Last of Us is one of those games that I really, I really loved, um, and thought it was a masterpiece. But, you know, a lot of people didn't and they have valid critiques about the game that I think are more and more valid the more, the more time we are, you know, distant from The Last of Us and the more we see different things. And so I'm interested to see, you know, there are three games come to mind that I think are",

And so I'm interested to see, you know, there are three games come to mind that I think are going to differ in people's minds as we gain more distance from them. And one has already, BioShock Infinite is a great example of this. Uh, people were up that game's ass and then it took a little while and then people started to say like, I don't know about this game. Like there's this, this is a great game, great story, it's fun, but there's this, this and this wrong with it. And it took people a little bit of distance to figure that out. I think Metal Gear Solid 5 is going to be another one of those games. I've not played it, but I see more and more significant criticism of that game every day that from people that, um, I trust and that people that have just got gained distance and thought about it for a little while. I've been like, well, gameplay is excellent and impeccable, but what about this, this and this?",

Like what, what people think about in a year? Um, is it going to be one of those games like the original BioShock that I think actually even gets better with age, uh, and people have more and more positive things to say about it? Or is it going to be more like Uncharted 3 where people liked it, then they didn't, then they did, then they really don't. And like, and like people, so I'm interested to see be one of those. It's definitely not going to be like a BioShock. It's another Halo. I mean, that's the thing. That's the thing. Isn't it going to be Halo 4 or Halo 3 was the last time anybody thought about or talked about any of those games? There, Halo 1, Halo 2 is the only Halo anybody.
