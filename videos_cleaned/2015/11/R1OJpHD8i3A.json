I'm here with the coolest dudes in video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. Now, we're doing something special today. A Nintendo Direct just happened yesterday. We recorded topics three and four that you will hear in the future after this happens, but for now, we're just going to Nintendo. We're getting right into it. I am so excited. That was a good one. It was a good one. Y'all talking **** the whole time, but I don't care. We weren't ****. No, it was a good one. It was good. It was fine. It was good. It wasn't just fine, it was good. Big surprise there. But here's, here's the thing. Yes, of course, there was the big surprise, but my thing with the Nintendo Directs, there's nothing besides E3 that gets me more excited in video games than Nintendo Directs. When Nintendo games, you get more excited about the Direct. That's the thing. I like announcements. I'm a big fan of announcements. That's why",

That was the biggest pop you gave that whole thing is when at the end they're like, \"The Smash Bros. There's more Smash Bros. coming December.\" You're like, you put up your hands, \"Great!\" That's such a good sign screen, man. I just, but I love it. I love announcements and I love that there's this, this presentation and here's 45 minutes. Yeah, we're going to see a bunch of **** we don't want, sure, but that's, they need to do that. It's a press conference. You know what I mean? Usually you have to wait for press conference, you got to wait for E3s, your games comes or whatever.

We'll have to see in the Let's Plays next week. No, but I thought I had a good time. It was a fun conference. I wasn't talking ****. We're doing the same thing we do at every conference. We just like Mystery Science Theater, but I just, you know, I get really defensive over Nintendo. I can see it in your eyes, so why I just back off a little bit sometimes. No, you don't need to.

I mean, I'll tell you right now, I mean, this just broke right before we started recording. NPDs are out. Yoshi's Woolly World was the eighth bestselling game at retail in the United States and it out, so you're the Yoshi's. I've been telling it out sold Uncharted and Nathan Drake Collection, um, which came in at number nine. That's crazy. Although, uh, it's worth noting that the NPD numbers do not count, uh, bundles, um, which I'm sure PS4 sold plenty of with the Nathan Drake Collection. But I, I say that just to show that there is a group of people that are still buying these even more obscure, um, or not as desirable exclusives. So when you see something like Zelda being confirmed as still a Wii U game, um, which is not a huge surprise, uh, that shows that that game's going to sell very well. Yeah, when",

So let's just go down, down the order of how things happened in this Nintendo Direct, this beautiful, beautiful Nintendo Direct. Zelda: Twilight Princess HD finally confirmed. Greg owes me a burrito 'cause he said, \"This ain't happening.\" I was like, \"What's wrong with you?\" When did you say that? Why cannibal, yeah, but I thought, why cannibalize your Zelda game that apparently is not coming in 2016? I don't care. They said 2016. It's not coming 2016. I'll double down. I'll put another burrito on the line that you're not getting your Zelda Wii U in 2016. I mean, I don't want to bet that if it doesn't come out in 2016, they're going to be in trouble. I don't believe that. I, I'm still holding out even though they're **** saying all this stuff. I'm still holding out that it's not coming to Wii U. Like, and",

It makes no sense for it not, especially this, this Direct confirms it to me. Yeah, absolutely. So, but I'm wait, wait, before we move, why would you make that bet? It like conclusively leaked that like a month ago. I like making entertaining shows where Tim and I argue about things and I, I'll buy a burrito anytime. It's not like I bet him 100 bucks. I wasn't like, I was like, \"It's going to happen.\" But so you make bets just to make them. Your bets don't mean anything. People get engaged. They talk about it then on Twitter and they tweeted us about it. I thought it was a dumb move. So, but now if I, if I really don't, now if this Zelda game is going to be so far out, yeah, yeah.

I mean, it gets, I think it gets shot on a lot. It's definitely not, it's, I, I don't think it's, it's not, it is good. It's not amazing, forgettable. It's definitely, it was definitely a decline in quality, um, that I think really actually started with more like the Minish Cap than anything else. And then kind of just started like Wind Waker was to, to me, the last, I **** love Wind Waker. And, and to me, that was the last truly interesting, just aesthetically pleasing, really interesting looking, different kind of Zelda game.

I just didn't, I was like, \"Nah, no way. Not for me.\" So I, I don't get, I'm, I'm with you that I don't, so you never beat it? No, no, no, really? No. I did. And all I remember is fringe fingers turning into a wolf in the beginning. Like, I don't remember that game. I played that game, sucked. I played that game stem to and just don't know, don't remember anything about it 'cause I just, meanwhile, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, uh, Wind Waker, these are things, you know what I mean?

Like, God damn, that's funny. I, I like Twilight Princess. It's not my favorite Zelda game, but I don't think it's as bad as people make it out to be. But I will say that watching the an HD trailer, I was excited because I knew this was coming. I want a burrito off of it, damn it. But I was excited to see the trailer because I thought it was going to be impressive to me in the way that Wind Waker HD, when I saw that trailer, I was like, \"Ooh, this looks good.\" You know?

It's, I thought I'd get a little bit more of like, \"Ah!\" And I didn't. Yeah. Um, but there's a Wolf Link amiibo, so Zigger's happy out there. Of course, Zigger must be. He's probably in a coma right now with all the amiibo talk and all these different amiibos. I'll say that I think it's a smart move for them to release the game because a lot of people do love it. And, and there is not, you know, there's a dearth of games on Wii U. So I mean, I think it makes perfect sense.

So I was glad that they opened with it. Artwork leaked. There was little like, it was on the eShop. Yeah, it was like, \"Of course it's going to happen.\" Yeah. And the, the big thing about the Direct for me is like, there's, there was so many games talked about, some of them for just three seconds. But like, that's all I need. It's just like, there's a lot of Nintendo things happening. Not all of it's going to be for you, but there's going to be a lot of it. This Direct had so many things that I was just like, \"Yes!

It, it was new footage, but I mean, it didn't show anything new. Link kind of like had a weird like hood on. Yeah, scar thing. Um, I have a, I have a lot, I have a lot of hope in that game actually. I hope with the Wolf amiibo or whatever that's worth. There's other, you can put the other amiibos, Zelda themed amiibos. Take your time with that game. All the time you need on NX. But they, I mean, it's, I mean, they, they re, I still think it might be on the NX too. But if we believe the NX might come out next fall, which I don't think it will, excuse me, I'm burping.

And I think I, but I think for the like the success of the NX, I think it's upsetting. I wished that in the time we hadn't heard about the game, they just completely moved over and started fresh on the NX. It's still possible that they're doing that again. Remember like we said it before, they're in the space in between right now. And so they can't necessarily, you know, Twilight Princess was a GameCube and a Wii game. And I, I don't, I don't necessarily think that it's not, it's impossible that this is the same thing. They just can't say that, you know. Yeah, no. And I, I think I will be shocked if this game's not on NX in some form. My biggest question is if this is a 2016 game, the NX isn't in 2016, what do they",

My biggest question is if this is a 2016 game, the NX isn't in 2016, what do they do with it? And the thing is, they might not do the exact same they did with Twilight Princess. They might do something more similar to Smash Bros. on the 3DS and Wii U where it's the same game, but there's more stuff on the NX one. And that's going to make people want to buy it either again or wait and buy that version. Yeah, I think I just, I don't believe that NX is going to come out next year simply because it doesn't seem, it seemed so back in like between the NES and SNES transition in '91. NES was still like really viable actually for a long time. I mean, they were releasing first party Nintendo games in 1994. Um, so it was, it was, it was different then. SNES and N64 was a little more tapered. And by the time you got to GameCube, N64 was basically dead. Um, I remember the last N64 games I bought were in",

So I just, when you think about the transition from GameCube to Wii, 2004 and 2005, especially 2004, were really strong years for that console. But by 2006, the console was dying or dead already. And the, the, the release schedule of some of the games still on Wii U, uh, in 2016 indicate to me that NX, it just wouldn't make sense to release NX then. You know, I don't think it's, I don't think NX is a fall 2017, but I think it's probably maybe spring 2017. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, my money's on 2016, but just because I, we don't have anything besides Zelda left for the latter half of the year. No, but, but still, I just feel like you want it to taper and have some a vacuum of excitement before you, you don't want. This was the same",

No, but, but still, I just feel like you want it to taper and have some a vacuum of excitement before you, you don't want. This was the same, was the argument I made with why Zelda shouldn't move over to NX completely. It's because you don't want to burn the people that are going to be there for you, the only people that are guaranteed going to be there for you, the people that own Wii U. So it's, it's as long as you treat them well towards the end of the life cycle. Like Nintendo's fan base is, is demonstrably shrinking. And you need to take care of those people before you try to expand out where the Blue Ocean strategy kind of thing only works when you have a strong core, which is why, why the Wii, I think, succeeded because I just don't, I feel like I just, burn me, burn me hard.

Like, give it some time to die. See, my argument to that would be that the people that aren't adults with money aren't the people that are clamoring for this Zelda game. Like, those are the ones that are playing all these other games that I don't care about. Like the Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival or whatever the hell it's called. We'll find out. I hope I'm, I hope I'm wrong just in the sense that I want to see what the hell this thing is. But and I, I think we will see at E3. But, um, it would be nice for it to come out in the fall.

So, um, yeah, yeah. Um, so then Bill Trinen comes out, talks about Triforce Heroes. There's an update, 30 stage free download. Talks about Splatoon, new stages, equipment, tournament mode. Mario Maker has a portal site where you can go on the internet and like look at websites that way, download them and sync them to console later. Hell yes! All of this to me is great news. This is what I want from Nintendo where it's these games are platforms. You're not going to need to wait for 10 years for the sequel to come out or whatever.

It's only been out a couple months. We've already gotten multiple announcements or updates and stuff. So very stoked about that. Then they started talking about some eShop titles. Pokemon Picross, which I've never been a big Picross guy. No, it's, it's interesting to see that come out and it's a, it's a, you know, this was, this one of the free to start games. Picross. Yeah, it seems like this is like a new model in conjunction with the, the rumors that all the Nintendo mobile games are going to be free to play.

But Picross games on Nintendo, Picross games have been huge for five plus years in Japan. So then the eShop title that I'm most excited about is the one called Fast Racing Neo. We've seen it before a little bit, but we're not getting a new F-Zero. Yeah, like F-Zero or something, but it's like pretty much a spiritual successor to the N64, um, era of those games.

Uh, Pokk\u00e9n Tournament. We saw a new Shadow Mewtwo trailer. That game looks amazing to me. Like, I mean, when I say amazing, I mean very, very solid eight out of 10. Are you going to fight? Yeah, that looks awesome. I mean, it looks, it's a fighting game that, that's how I imagine Pokemon games would be when I was a dumb little kid. You know, like that's what the cartoons looked like.

So, um, yeah, it's, uh, it's cool to see those characters all in the same world. Not the first time we've seen that, but yeah. Um, yeah, I mean, it's a game that I'd certainly look to maybe play later. It's cool to see them all together in more of a actual, it's not really, didn't look too much like an RPG, but like an action RPG game. Usually we see them together in fighting games or like music games or stuff like that. Um, then Star Fox. We saw a trailer. April 2nd is the new release date. We saw more of the Walker.

Like we're playing Fallout 4 now and I know a lot of people think that game's ugly, but that's not really one of the problems with the game in my opinion. Um, it's just that when you think about Star Fox's heritage, especially on Super Nintendo and N64, those games showcase those consoles in ways that other games didn't.
