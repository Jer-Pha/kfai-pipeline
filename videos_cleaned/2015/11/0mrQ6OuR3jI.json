I don't think he'd done anything before that, and I don't think he did anything since, which is unfortunate because that movie actually wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. But I think that's Daniel Craig's fear now, is that he wants out of the series because he's been typecast. But I don't know if that's true. I don't think I buy that. Does that even exist anymore?

Quantum of Solace fucked things up. Skyfall was like, let's kind of get it back on track. And then this one just kind of put things together, but didn't go anywhere with it.

What I liked about Casino Royale that unfortunately I think Quantum of Solace kind of uh, kind of jostled a little bit was that Casino Royale was a little more like a Bourne movie. It was taken from it was taking a lot of cues from The Bourne Identity in the Bourne series, where it was super violent. The action was super fucking visceral. And like, it wasn't tongue-in-cheek. Like, I'm going to say a tagline afterward. Like, there's no there's at no point does he ever say with the rare with the exception of like one or two choice lines, like, \"Don't lose your head.\" Those fucking dumb one-liners, right?

And then and then by the time Skyfall comes around, I think Skyfall was a reaction to Quantum of Solace, where Quantum of Solace was because of the writer strike and because of some of the circumstances of when it was being produced, it wasn't as good as it could have been. Uh, namely, I think Daniel Craig actually had wrote some of it, if I'm not mistaken, because they didn't have the writers. Like the writer was striking at the time. Why you take a shot at this, Daniel? Well, he's a co-producer on as well. Great line. Awesome. Thought that myself.

Weezer's Blue Album reminds me of um, my sister's old boyfriend, Skip, who bought it for me. Um, because I was like, I used to he us he was a guitar teacher and he he actually helped buy my first drum kit. Um, because he worked at a music store. And I I remember driving around with him. He had like a Camaro or something. And we used to listen to the to the Blue Album and sounds awesome. And uh, cool. Yeah, he used to go like Taco Bell and stuff. Like he was like really cool to me.

Yeah, for me, I mean, like you're bringing up old stuff that I'm thinking of too. Like when I think uh, when it's I looked it up, Carole King, uh, \"It's Too Late\" or whatever. Like that takes me right back to the motor home because my parents had a Carole King tape that they would put in and just listen to over and over and over again.
