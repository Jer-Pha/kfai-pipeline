So here's my thing, I want to talk about the article, but I also want to talk about how ridiculous people's reaction to the article is. Sure, because I just don't understand the kind of reactions that it got, where vicious uproar. My uproar was not vicious. I did not tweet, I did not yell, I did not scream. I saw it and then I saw people discuss, you know, like I saw the headline, I saw people reacting to it that the ads lied to you and da da da. And I was like, oh, that sucks, because I hadn't started it yet. I haven't jumped in. I don't know what the story is going to be. And the story I have set up is Locke first, Chief. That's the thing.

I don't know the spoiler of what happened or where they're going or whatever, but the ads got me hyped based on the story. You know what I mean? If that makes sense. So then knowing that that's not really what it was, I'm like, oh, I don't know how I feel about that. Yeah, but I mean, here's my thing, that's not Mitch's fault. No, you know. Well, I'm not mad at Mitch. Okay, well then, but what I'm saying is a lot of people are, oh, people are mad about.

And in terms of the spoilers, yeah, spoiling what's not in the game is spoiling the game. But if you're being lied to, this stuff should be presented to you, right? Okay, well, read the story. What's the what? I I because I didn't click on, you know, I mean, I Halo last night and now I'm into it, but I still haven't gotten to where the story falls apart in 180s. It's not. So this is, it's it's a long article. I'm going to just read read excerpts here. I'm I'm do spoilers here, but they're spoiling just what's not in the game.

So most of the cinematic scenes you've seen for Halo tell a very different story than the game itself. The debut trailer for Halo for Xbox One shown in E3 2013 has little resemblance to anything that happens in Halo 5: Guardians. The lonely uh, robed traveler wandering through a desert wasteland never shows up anywhere, even thematically. In fact, your squad is with you the entire way. This is a co-op campaign through and through. Nothing about this scene seems to matter to the main plot other than the existence of the winged Guardian itself. So, okay, there's that. So far, so good. Then the most baffling piece of marketing is the commercial twacks showing two separate perspectives of the same scene. You may remember Master Chief looking down on a dying Locke contrasting with an alternate scene that reverses the roles and shows a Locke chastising a wounded John-117.

Above, the Infinity is smoldering, the sky possibly singing towards the planet surface. None of this happens in Halo 5, not even close. And then they go through this whole two sides of the story and how like just a lot of that stuff is just not what it seems at all. Okay, see, and then I I think it's just a bad headline, because when I saw the headline, I assumed what we had seen leading up to this was not the story. I was assuming we were getting a Batman: Arkham Origins style twist where I thought spoilers for Batman or Batman: Arkham Origins. I thought, yeah, you're about to go play it when you get home, Kevin. I thought we were going through and we're getting this Black Mask story, right? But really quick into that game, it's like",

I thought that I'm waiting right now playing it based on the headline, waiting for the other shoe to drop of Locke gets killed and it's just Chief or so, you know, or now they're immediately like, we all know they're going to become friends and have to fight a greater force or whatever. I thought that was going to happen immediately or something like that. Uh, that's not bad. Now I understand, now I understand what you're talking about. I would say the E3 2013 marketing lied to you.

They don't have to say all the marketing lied to, but anyways, but I mean, but but that's the thing though, is I I do feel like this is an important conversation to have where marketing tools and stuff should it",

Or does it, are they promising you something? Are they promising that what you're buying has this thing in it? Sure, you know. And it's like when you watch a movie trailer, movie trailers and Mitch even makes this point, nowadays give away the whole movie. Sure. So it's like, would you rather that or would you rather them kind of tease you with the stuff that's just not in the game? Right, you know. And some things are just like, in terms of thematic stuff, it makes sense where I didn't really expect the scenes of them killing each other to be in that game. How would that happen? I didn't expect the scene of Chief walking alone in the desert in his poncho to be in the game. But see,",

The the biggest change there is the fact that that's so old and technically that wasn't Halo 5. Yeah, that was Halo back when it was just Halo. Yeah. Um, so things change and I get that. But that sets a tone for the game. That sets me being like, oh, this is different for Halo. This is something that I he never wears a poncho. But but he's never like alone like that, never. And why is he wearing armor and then a poncho? Yeah, what's going on? It was a disguise. Make any sense? But but I do think that that interested me. And as somebody that loves Halo but isn't necessarily going to play every single Halo game that comes out, like I'm like, oh, that looks cool.

That's what I'm saying is I thought what based on the headline, I thought it was. And I I was thinking about how mad I would be that if Arkham Origins story was spoiled that way. You know what I mean? That's what I'm saying. Now we're just talking about straight up the early marketing isn't what it turned out to be. Does that matter? I don't think so. You've had how like I'm having the exact opposite where we watched the trailer launch trailer and I was like, this is getting me hyped. And then last night we're doing the thing where we're falling through the sky and the Muse song should be playing, but it isn't. I'm like, all right, yeah, I remember this. All right, cool.

I don't even remember the execution switcheroo kind of thing. But I mean, so that's the thing that that's I think a lot of people do, you know, like especially the ones that are invested in this and like invested in the Halo lore and stuff and all the Hunt the Truth, like the whole Hunter thing, the whole like you hunting this thing. It's like that's not really the point of this game. And it's like that's crazy, because that's all they've said, Hunt the Truth, hunt the shit truth. And we're not hunting things.

I I I'm like, oh, Halo, I want to play this. My girlfriend, I pick it up off the Walmart shelf and I come and play it. So like, Hunt the Truth, like if you were to ask me what's Hunt the Truth mean, I'd be like, oh, well, you know, Locke's hunting Chief and they're trying to get to the bottom of what this message he just got from this person was. And if that's not it, great. But that's what I mean, to me, the Hunt the Truth campaign still makes sense, because I don't know. I didn't listen to the podcast. I haven't listened to Car Talk. I haven't listened to Hunt the Truth podcast. I haven't listened to these other things. You know what I mean? Or like really watch these old school trailers.

Like, shit that. You know what I mean? I would love to not know anything going into it, because you know, I knew I was going to play Halo with Christine, right? Like I know I'm going to play Uncharted. Uh, I don't think they need to be deceptive. Don't show me something like you're fighting 80-story tall enemies, right? And then you get in the game, you're always just fighting grunts or something. You know what I mean? Like if it's one for one. But then again, I'm still speaking to something I didn't see and don't understand.

And a lot of times it's just fun little Easter eggy things like, oh, like that's a different take of a line that they said or whatever. But like with something like this, I think that this is a, it's a bigger deal in the sense that like, it's the everything they've hyped up about the story is different. Really? Yeah, I mean, it it's definitely from what I've played and what I've seen and like from reading this, I'm like, yeah, that's right.

Like I think that if it if the original thing had shown more of that team element stuff, then this wouldn't be such a a problem, a lie, you know. It'd be more of like a you just got more. The marketing stuff was just more for you to enjoy, you know. And like that's like the the forers movies when they first announced them and stuff, all the trailers weren't even the movies at all. That was the point though. It was just like getting people hyped for whatever ended up, you know, disappointing everyone. But like at least the marketing was, it was marketing, you know. It was just get hyped for this thing. And how long ago was the Dual execution Lone Wolf trailer thing? Less than a year. Okay, interesting. Yeah, so",

Okay, just some CG in the desert. Got it. But anyways, I just think that the the the idea of the lies and marketing, we were talking a couple days ago about the if Zelda wasn't on Wii U and just was on NX. I think this is a very similar thing. I feel like you were promising someone something, yeah, by tantalizing him with it. Like there's no difference to me between watching these trailers and Nintendo showing Zelda and saying it's going to be on Wii U. My question is, what about what's been the case in developer interviews and stuff? Have they made it sound like he was going to be alone at any point?

I feel like that's that's the course I've been on where we've I've had them on Up at Noon. I've talked to them. They've been on our live shows or whatever. I forget which ones. And like I see the game and I always expect, I always heard about, you know, it's Locke's team versus Chief's team and this is what's happening and we're trying to figure all this out. We're hunting them or whatever. So like the again, I I don't know. I feel like we're hung up on this. Read more. What was what else is what's so mad? I feel like we're hung up on one trailer where there's an execution scene. Yeah, I mean, that's the the biggest thing. Well, big deal. Um, I mean, I I don't want to read some of those.

But there's just some things based on like characterization of Locke and Chief and how they interact with each other. And it's just, it's a delicate thing, because I don't think there was a right answer. Like I'm contradicting myself many times in this, because I'm saying like they're lying and that's bad. But also, I think it's a good thing. I think it just needs to be a little bit as it's the thematic thing going back. I mean, like I guess this would be the question of like, if if everything, if video game journalism and criticism and everything else was where it is right now and Metal Gear Solid 2 came out, would we would it be that Metal Gear? Would we put up an article that said Metal Gear Solid 2's ad campaign lied to you? Yeah, I mean, I think that is kind of uh, does that matter? Because that",

It's like, I think and like, why didn't you wait to do this? I'm like, I think that it's it needs to happen now. And I it's like, what's the point of waiting for it? Like don't read it if you don't want to read it and stay just stay away from it. But I think this is interesting. I think Mitch did something really cool of going back and finding all these things.

Like I agree with you, if it was like, this is how it changed over time, then that's an innocuous innocuous headline that you'd read and be like, okay, cool, that's oh, interesting. The game changed and developed and evolved. Right? Yeah, but when you're trying to come up with a punchy headline that attracts people, you know exactly. I mean, that's really what it is.

Would I be like, oh, like that's I think that is a a very valid thing. I mean, let's even with Metal Gear, like that's a like thinking back on how they would have handled that. And like if Metal Gear Solid 2 had come out in this day and age, there would be a million articles about that. Sure, talking about how, you know, this is like be they I think much angry.

I think I think the thing that seems to be lost on a lot of people is my assumption is that they've already talked about the next Halo game. So uh, my assumption is that this this saga will continue. I'm not going to play Halo. I've no interest in playing it at all. But my my assumption is that, you know, 343 is going to continue this series in perpetuity for a very long time. And that this story is not done yet. So I, you know, they might be setting the cadence.

But I'm not sure that Microsoft's intent was to deceive anyone either. So I think it's a it's a valid point to make. But you know, I don't I don't really have much an opinion on. I don't really care. It's it's um, it wouldn't be the first time or the last time that a video game trailer. It's like Fallout 4 is being largely advertised with Pip-Boy videos and live action trailers that are not going to have anything to do with like that, you know.

I do agree that it seems like people really don't like the campaign um from what I've been reading in terms of the story. Um, I've read, you know, I've read that complain quite a bit. People like multiplayer and the game's getting great scores. So it can't be that bad. It's like it's like an 80 between 85 and a 90. I think I'm a Metacritic. I think it'll be just fine. Yeah, yeah.
