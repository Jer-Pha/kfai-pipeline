Jeez. Do you have a list of everything that came out? No I mean we can we can kind of kind of just go through it. I I have I I'll be honest. I've lost track of everything that has come out. I try to play everything like every big release. I I try to beat every game to completion. I really do try. It's hard. Yeah that's a that's a long road to hope. I I feel like the game releases didn't start until Metal Gear. Oh wow. Does that make sense? Like did you not play Bloodborne? I didn't play Bloodborne. Yeah I Okay. Yeah. If If you can go down the list and like Dying Light Dying Light I beat Dying Light. Okay. What do you think of Dying Light? Better than I thought it would be. Yeah. I I thought uh cuz I thought Dead Island was kind of a piece of **** Um I thought I liked parts of it but",

And I I don't like weapon degradation. Yeah. On an RPG level I liked it in Far Cry but I don't like like I love the idea of like you're using a gun it blows up on you like \"Oh that's so random. That's so cool.\" But when you're just you're whacking away and the the blade is going down I thought they did a much better job with it in Dying Light. And I thought it was fun to control. I was like we haven't had a Mirror's Edge game in a long time. In a game that out Mirror's Edge Mirror's Edge you know what I mean? Like open world parkour. Exactly. It was awesome. It felt great.

It got to a point where you can just like sit on the legend kick kick kick stupid. Uh but I I ended up enjoying the game way more than I thought I would. And I thought uh Roger Craig Smith did a good job being the voice being that main voice. Like I don't know. It was it was like a really good Dead Island. So yeah. Yeah. I really liked it. Still I'm going through my list. Yeah. Uh Bloodborne though that I ended up having to stop just it's the same frustration I ended up having with um Dark Souls games. Yeah.

Um just the the overall like once you save everyone responds and you're like ah like it is stressful and it's cool but like it just sucks. I like that I have to I I don't have that much time. We'll get to it eventually. But you and I are talking about Fallout. Like what I like about Fallout is living in that world and like what I do matters. So if I do kill something that's this big guy he's dead now in that world. You know what I see? But it also has a quick save option. So I'm an adult. I'm sorry. Did you play IDARB? IDAR.

Holy **** I thought it was last year. No it the remember they did betas forever and it was at every event ever and then it got delayed to February. It's it was such a cool idea that doesn't work. It lives or dies based on the online like you know stay based on who's playing it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I feel like that's a game that would probably benefit for being like a free-to-play where if you buy the game you can play as the monster and then everyone else free-to-play is just like the dudes. Um never got into it. It was weird. It's just it's such a weird concept.

Have you tried to do a Vault of Glass run on Destiny and like try to organize people? There's no matchmaking so you have to like I would get on Twitter and just yell be like I need a team and people like I'm on PS4. I'm like \"Well I'm on Xbox.\" And they're like \"Too bad.\" I was like \"I couldn't get four **** people to reply to me.\" Yeah.

Left 4 Dead was just jump in and pick up a gun and play and you don't need to have like specialized skills of what you're doing. You know what I mean? learning curve on Evolve was just it was ridiculous. Not only on an individual basis but as a team and being able to work together. Yeah. And then maybe they should have like steps or iterations where like it started out as a very simplified version of Left 4 Dead and then it built up to what it was.

Gave it away. Well so so what happened? You're just he's just on the street and he just like dead drop passes it to somebody as he goes. I bought it because of the gauntlet. I remember Freddy was playing Hot Shots on it. I was like \"That thing looks amazing. Like this is a cool device.\" Um and then it just started collecting dust cuz I stopped using it. And then we did a live show and a fan of ours went on our subreddit. She talked about a great show. Uh sad though someone broke in my car and stole my Vita. I'm like that's great.

It was fantastic for when I had it but it just it sucks they didn't support that thing. Yeah exactly. I wish I could have definitely gone for more amazing games. Uh The Order 1886. I never played it.

Like you're just telling me this one thing which I would have loved if you would have just told me in the beginning it's going to be Red. I think you look at it this way there's a lot of people who probably play the Batman Arkham games who don't know anything about Batman. So you've never heard of Red Hood.
