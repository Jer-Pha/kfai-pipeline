Go to KindaFunny.com/forums, leave a topic for the show, and we'll read it just like we're doing right now with C.R. Stern. Hey Tim, Colin, and Greg, long time, first time. Colin frequently talks about how his favorite NES series, Mega Man, all feature perfect gameplay. Which games have near perfect gameplay in your eyes? Are there modern games that approach NES pinnacle gameplay in your eyes as well? The only thing that jumps in my mind perfect is Mario, the 2D Marios, sure, specifically the world previous. Anything that in the in the in the current world that approaches that? He talking about anything current games or any modern games? Going back to to any games at all that have perfect gameplay? I say Mario 1, Mario 3, Mario World. Mario World, yeah. Um, I mean, two, two's great too, but like I think that one, three, and World stand on their own.

Um, especially when you get more modern, I definitely can't think of any off the top of my head. The name that jumped to mind, 'cause it's and it's I don't it's it's a complicated question, right? Of is anything ever perfect kind of thing? But like a near-perfect gameplay loop of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The fact that like, don't get me wrong, like you can get frustrated, not know what you're doing, da da da, but the way all the systems work together, like we always talk about, right? And the the the GMP and I want to build this and I want to play that, you know what I mean? The fact of like, what what does perfect gameplay mean?

Well, that's that's a that's a loop, I think. Yeah, well, that's what I'm driving at, has on gameplay loop. Uh, in terms of gameplay, I mean, it's games that have rules that are predictable and you know, I think I think very deeply about about gameplay, like gameplay, playing the game, the act of playing the game, which I think is is lost on a lot of people today. Um, and is forgiven by a lot of people. It's the reason why I think Call of Duty is so good because it's good gameplay, you know, like the game plays very very well. Um, series that come to mind, yeah, Mario, I think is a perfect example. I think even Castlevania one, two, and three, um, have perfect, near perfect gameplay, even though the games are stiff and heavy, that is the idea. So they're unforgiving, the",

Um, but I really love the the the stiff is used as a bad word and it it should I think usually be used in that way when you're talking about gameplay, but the heaviness of the game, it feels like a Castlevania game. That's the way Castlevania feels. And then it really changed quite a bit with, you know, you know, a game like Symphony of the Night, which had fast gameplay, but still fluid and perfect gameplay. Uh, Ninja Gaiden one, two, and three, um, are up there with Mega Man to me in terms of gameplay. Those games are fast. Um, they they don't plot at all. Jumping on walls and just running like the the think about people out there played the original",

Like it's you're just running, running, running, slice, slice, slice, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, you know, like it's I don't know, the those games are really really special in that regard. Um, modern games don't really nail gameplay the way they used to. I mean, that's just the nature of the way games are made now. So so what what's funny about what you're saying is all those games are 2D Platformers and like what I was talking about as well is 2D Platformers. Like are every is every other genre and like once you get to 3D, is it just too complicated to have that perfect? No, because I I talked about Call of Duty, which I think is is just in terms of shooters, like unrivaled in the way it plays. And and so that's the that's the bar",

I don't I don't make shooters, but that it can be done in other other um genres and other modes and other ways of looking at games. But I think that it it works in 2D so well because there's little else to rely on in those games to satiate the gamer, which is why I think those games are so special and why that genre is so special. And side-scrollers will never disappear because they they just really do benefit the person that wants gameplay above all else. Um, and gameplay is absolutely king. So um that's why and and I've I've beaten the horse dead and why I'm so excited about Matterfall and Alienation from Housemarque is because they make perfect gameplay games.

Um, so a game like Resogun or Dead Nation even, um, these are you know, Dead Nation is not only a game that is great to play, but also has what Greg was talking about, which was a gameplay loop, which Resogun also has, which which is why Housemarque's one of the great developers because they really understand gameplay and that is a lost art. There's a lot of excuses made for a lot of games, games I like, um, that um, man, this game's pretty, the story is great, look at these characters, look at the environments. Oh, the game about the gameplay. It's what I always talk about with Assassin's Creed. Assassin's Creed would be a 10. And I'm not talking about the new one. I've not played Syndicate, I've not played Black Flag or or any of these games in the last three years, but I'm talking",

If the if Assassin's Creed III played the way it looked, that would be maybe one of the best games of all time. You know what I mean? Like it but it just doesn't. It's like, man, this is a really great environment. Look at these environments, these people look so real and the story is interesting and the voice acting, it's so immersive. And then you move around and it's like, oh, they nailed they didn't nail what matters most, which is playing the **** game. And uh, it's not to say every game needs to be. We were talking about Gone Home, which is a game, you know, you might not even call it a game. And I I don't I don't maybe you shouldn't call it a video game. I don't know. It's a Choose Your Own Adventure game. You make choices. Yeah, so",

You make choices. Yeah, so there's no gameplay in it at all. But it's great. And and Gone Home, I I really loved as well. And that's like what people call walking simulator, just like, you know, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or um, you know, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. So it doesn't it doesn't mean that games have to have gameplay. It means that gameplay is usually the nugget of what makes a game worthwhile. Um, and so we go back to games that made had no excuses because that's all they had. They didn't have I want to give a shout out to Tetris, dude. You know, you know what game that came to mind first straight up after that you mentioned Mega Man was Arkanoid, where like Arkanoid is **** perfect. What a Arkanoid is in my mind a 10.

So the very simple things like River Raid is one of my favorite Atari games. That game is very simple. Um, but the gameplay is fun. Kung Fu on NES is just five levels over and over again, but it's awesome, you know. Like so and it's not because wow, look at Mr. X is such a compelling **** enemy or you know, there's like four different enemy types in the game. It's not anything. It's just like it's fun to play and they didn't have excuses back then. They didn't have anything else to to hide, you know, what made the game fun. Look at look at The Order. We talk about that game a lot. The Order is gorgeous. I don't know if there's like any game on PS4 or very",

I don't know if there's like any game on PS4 or very few games on PS4 that look better than that game. But it doesn't. It's just it's just a generic cover-based third-person shooter at the end of the day. And that's what turned people off to it. It wasn't the way the game looked or the way the game sounded or the story. It was the way the game played. Um, so man, gameplay is we we must have lose sight of the fact that gameplay is just very very important. And can modern games nail it? Yes. And do they? Yeah. Um, but ****, look at the games we love. Like Fallout 3. VATS is there because the game sucks at gameplay. Yeah. Like like VATS is an excuse for not being able to do first-person shooter controls. And and we let it go because everything else around it's so good. But is the gameplay good in Fallout 3? Like gameplay mechanics are really good. The RPG",

I don't think the mechanics are good at all. And that's when I'm talking mechanics, I'm talking about for RPG mechanics, I'm talking about leveling up, you know, skill points, stuff. Yeah, it's great. But like and Fallout, one of my Fallout 3 and New Vegas, I I adore those games. But man, they're like not good. Like if you just played them in a vacuum, if you're just like, if you if you made Fallout 3, if you removed all the elements, all the story and made a corridor in front of them, like Killzone for instance, and they like play. No, it would be awful. Be **** awful, you know. So that's why I'm excited about Fallout 4 because I want to see how it feels, right? And they talk about bringing it in and all this",

I just right now I want to just keep thinking it's just a fancier version of Fallout 3. So when I get it and it's not, I can be **** amazed. That's why I I'm telling you, man, that's why Far Cry is so great. And that's why I think Dying Light's great too is because it's like, wow, it's this open world. We have expectations that everything suffers in an open world, right? Like just design wise, everything suffers. Like the gameplay is almost the last thing that matters in these games. Look at Assassin's Creed and Far Cry, you know, especially Far Cry III and Far Cry 4 came out and we just like, well, this is a this is a a shooter that is better than 90% of the shooters on the market. And this is an open world game that's",

Like a competent shooter in an open world. I really like the original Crysis for that the same reason. So I don't know, we can go on. I love talking about gameplay, man. Yeah, like I I love talking about mechanics and and uh, oh, go play Resogun. Jason A. asked, hey guys, do you think there'll ever be a successful PC console in the vein of the Steam Box? On the surface, it seems like a great idea. The 30-year library and the power of PC mixed with the affordability and big screen of a console. But in practice, it just hasn't worked out yet.

Here here is the Steam Box. You can get this, you can play 90% of the games. And if you get to something else, we will sell cards that we it will tell you what you need and where to get it and how to get it. This is the answer. And instead they said, here's a controller, everyone make a Steam Box. There's computers in a different format. And it was a million Steam Boxes. And it's the same cumbersome, confusing experience that I don't want to invest time in. Yeah, you know what I mean? Someone needs to get it together.

But if they would have done it, they were the people to do it and show it and make everyone believe in it. And they didn't. They left it open. And that's why nobody has a Steam Box. Nobody cares. Is it going to happen now or in the near future? No. Is it going to happen at some point? It's a far conclusion. It's going to happen. The my opinion. So I I disagree with Greg and in in certainly saying like no at all. I think it's inevit it's inevitable. It's totally I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you. I'm mad at you, but I didn't mean to hit you. It's okay. It's I think it's",

I think they absolutely did. But I don't think that they look at it like that. I just don't think they care. Exactly. No, it's failing us. Someone is going to come along and they are going to care. Um, because to the point like there is a wealth of games spanning since the late 70s really that can be played on the same sort of I don't want to say architecture because that's that's that's not necessarily true. But you can play like the the the way we play a game like Oregon Trail is the way we play a game like Dota 2, right? It's it's a it's a it's a computer and a monitor and a mouse or a keyboard or something like that. So in other words, this whole",

Like can't I can't imagine that that's not going to future. I see is that yeah, no one will ever get it together. No one will ever be big enough. And so what'll happen is yeah, when consoles do die out or whatever and there is no more set top boxes and whatever, however the **** it all comes down is it'll be that you have to suck it up and get a PC and figure it out or whatever the new machine is or TV is or dongle you plug in the you know what I mean?

We were all so wrong about that two, three years ago, four years ago. Now, final question of the day, uh AmazeHob says, in the past, you guys have talked about YouTube trying to take down Twitch using its new YouTube Gaming service with introduction of YouTube Red, which will which will require content creators to pay a fee of $9.99 to keep their videos public.

But I think this is like an important question to talk about because there's a lot of people not understanding what this service is and the difference between YouTube Gaming and YouTube Red and YouTube. Yeah, YouTube Gaming is just a different way to look at at YouTube and everything we talked about pre it coming out about it versus Twitch. They're not competitors in that way. It's just you YouTube is a competitor to Twitch. YouTube Gaming is just a different lens to put over YouTube to to look at channels in a more video game focused way. Like if you go to Gaming.KindaFunny.com, it'll work. Same thing for Gaming.KindaFunnyGames.com. Same thing for Gaming.EpicMealTime.com. Like doesn't matter what the YouTube channel is.

Cool. Until that day comes, it's not even worth time out because we don't know what they're going to do. This YouTube Red thing, there's so much people that are confused about. So you're going to need to pay to be able to have to make money off your videos? No, just if you don't your the only way your videos are private is if you don't accept the new terms of service.

I think that overall, this is going to benefit content creators. And I think content creators are getting a little upset about it right now. But it's going to we're now getting paid off watch time instead of views, which should benefit the smaller channels even more because if you have a smaller audience that's really dedicated and watches your entire video, you put up a 30-minute thing about how to get this trophy in this game and only 300 people watch it.
