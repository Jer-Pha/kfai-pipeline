And uh, it seems like people like it, but also have complaints that it seems pretty shallow. It's not very hardcore shooter. Um, but when I watch Greg play it, all I can think about is like, what a waste. This would have been an awesome single player game. Look at these, look at these, these models, look at these environments and the places they go. And some like, what a **** waste. That's the only thing I can, they have. That's all I've to say.

Christine was watching me play last night while she was packing for this trip. And she was looking or she would you feel like this game, beautiful. This game is spectacularly pretty. The way the grass moves on Endor, you move around. Yeah, authentic is the word that I, I go to. Like, it feels so, so, so Star Wars. And I like that so much. I think I'm calling that. I want you to know, is there is not like a campaign mode, but there is single player missions. Yeah, that I know. But that's not, but they're worth doing.

The tutorial missions, like the, the Endor chase and like that. Yup. The X-Wing and is the X-Wing. Like, I liked it. It's like, hey, all the fun **** that you want to do here, you just get thrown right into it in the survival modes. I haven't even played online at all. Yeah, I've just done the single-player stuff and had a great time with it. Interesting. It's definitely shallow. It definitely is not a super, super deep shooter game.

Yeah, I wonder, I campaign wise, like obviously a single player campaign is a whole different undertaking. That's a whole different scope of the project. What if they had done something like Titanfall where they are using the maps that you see in the competitive multiplayer, using sections there and just kind of like scripting some waves of enemies and like loosely tying it together along sort of a some kind of story involving a rebel clip squad or you know, that a specific Imperial detachment. Like, would that have done it for you? Yeah, anything. It's just, I don't like multiplayer games. So I mean, it's just, it's just my bias against against multiplayer.

I mean, is another game that's clearly suffered at retail and in longevity because of its lack of single-player functionality in terms of like something meaningful. I mean, just because you play a game by yourself doesn't mean it has a campaign or something that's worth, worth delving into. I mean, this is not the spirit of the game though. So I understand that that, you know, that I'm looking for something that's not really there. But what I had mentioned on Colin and Greg, which I think would be fun and interesting and something that maybe they'll consider doing is like, now the assets exist. Now this engine's obviously running in this particular way in this particular universe. Why not let, you know, they're clearly Garrity",

So why not let DICE continue to do that and and shift that **** off to another studio that could make, that can take a lot of those assets and just make a single player campaign for the next game or whatever? Because it's, it's, I really feel like Battlefront is going to not benefit from having not having a robust campaign in the same way that people complain about Titanfall. It's just at its Star Wars. So it's going to sell 15 million copies or ever be totally fine. It's just, you know, I think there's more that could have been done here, especially considering the game isn't quite as deep as I expected it to be from anecdotally from what I've been hearing from people.

And and compared to some of the other shooters people play like others and what that. So what, what's interesting is like, is that good enough? Right? Like, you, I'm right there with you. I don't play multiplayer games. Right? That's not really what I get into. I don't get into shooters all that much either. And like, it was, I forget what trailer was. We're watching next. It looks kind of interesting. And then I watched you guys do here. Let's guys like, damn, that looks fun. And then when I got here and I popped in in for me and I did, I got up.

And I'm also interested to see as a side of that, how people are already reacting very negatively to the season pass, not surprisingly. And a game that is seemingly somewhat shallow on the outside are going to be injected with a lot of content. Now it's going to rub people the wrong way. So I'm sure to see how that all unfolds. But I'm also interested to see now that the text there, the text Binarian DICE is using stuck neo familiar engine stuff like that. But now that the, like we said, the universe is there and the confines of the Star Wars universe, you're there. How bulky will the next game be? Because they have a lot of **** that's done already. And how much will they be able to",

So I'm as an outside observer, I'm just interested to see how this does because this is clearly gonna make a lot of money. But is it going to win a lot of goodwill from the gamer in the long run because of its shallowness when there are more hardcore shooters out there? 'Cause you look at Call of Duty. I have not played the new Call of Duty yet in any substantial way. I did two videos for our site. But I have not said that I played it. But it has a campaign. It has Zombies mode, which is going to be awesome. And it is awesome for a lot of people. And then it has a whole online suite. And it's the same price.
