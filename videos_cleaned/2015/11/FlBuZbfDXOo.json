Before we jump into the show and the shenanigans and the PlayStation stuff, we wanted to take a moment to talk about Alex Oldhouser. Uh, if you haven't been following us on Twitter, missed our Twitch stuff, and it's kind of weird because chronologically you're listening, you might be listening to a GameOverGreggy Show over on Kinda Funny or the Gamescast that was recorded before any of this happened, but this is our first recording of a show since the death of Alex. Uh, Alex was a Kinda Funny Best Friend, just like you, big Comedy Button fan, supported both us and The Comedy Button on Patreon. Uh, we just done a thank you video for him. We were talking him through Patreon messaging. We had met him at New York Comic-Con last year, um, and he was tragically killed in an automobile accident. He was, uh, struck across the",

He was, uh, struck across the road. And I mean, he was a great dude. You remember him. We both remember him. He made an impression on us for being a fun, jovial, great guy. Um, making matters even worse for him, I mean, the fact that he's 25, uh, a month before his home had been flooded, the the home he he his childhood home is where his mother lives, been flooded by a South Carolina storm. He had started a GoFundMe page for that, and then a month later is is taken from us this way. So we felt the best way we could pay it forward for him, for all the support he gave us, was of course to encourage you to go to GoFundMe.com/OldhouserFlood. In case you are listening to the MP3, I'll spell it out for you: O.L.D.H.O.U.S.E.R.F.L.O.O.D. Uh, it's up here on the screen. We'll put a link in the description, of course, for the episode.

Uh, according to Alex's post that he wrote there, of course, they need about $30,000 to fix this home and get it back to where it should be. And I feel like obviously it's the least we can do. I mean, no parents should have to bury their child, let alone worry about the financial burden of a flood ruining their house. Yeah, this is the best we can do.

Sony confirmed the news to Wired in a statement which briefly read, quote, \"We are working on utilizing PS2 emulation to bring PS2 games forward to the current generation. We have nothing further to comment at this point in time.\" End quote. But this is where things get interesting, Greg. Wired points to Digital Foundry's findings that indicate that three of the four older Star Wars games that launched recently on PS4 are already using the emulation. Quote, \"There are a number of signs indicating that they're running on proprietary software.\" And quote, Wired says in summing up Digital Foundry findings.

But this is indicating that the emulation is running on PS4 in a different sort of way, which is what I mean by, you know, saying it's it's in stark comparison to the way PS2 Classics ran in a vacuum where it was just like you boot it up and now you're playing a PS2. The three three of the four Star Wars games that came out, you know, retro Star Wars games, it's sad to call them retro because they're PS2 games, um, but they have trophies.

The PS4 iteration differs from the PS3 version by toting enhanced 1080p graphics with new effects, a new decision tracker at the end of of each chapter, bundled in enhanced experiments DLC, and perhaps most pivotally, the ability to play the game in chronological order, which was a major, major problem.

Dark Souls would have never even happened and these would have all been PlayStation exclusives for them, but they really didn't know what they had and it was Bandai Namco that figured out what was actually there. And so they published Dark Souls, Dark Souls and Dark Souls III.

If you remember back in the day, people bristled when they had when they sold horse armor for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. I remember that. It's something that has always happened, but if it's good enough content and you want to pay for it, why not pay for it? That's what it comes down to. Ellipsis.

There were other weapons if they were more a more experienced player that they could buy. It's up to them. If you're already make if you're already kicking ass, you probably don't need these, but if you want them, have them. It's just a matter of personal preference. There are hot debates around this all the time in the office because everybody's got their own opinion. For me, the more thought that's put into DLC, the more you should be able to charge for it because it's one of those things where you're creating another game into it into it unto itself.
