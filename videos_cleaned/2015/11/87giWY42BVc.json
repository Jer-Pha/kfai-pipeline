So I mean, I think that there's, there's a, there's a strange amount of nuance to the question in the sense that, you know, if you're just having a sexual relationship with them, absolutely. I mean, it's, you know, a lot of these women are **** gorgeous. Like it's, it's, it's, they are like the ideal sexual, uh, fantasy of a lot of men. That's why we watch it.
