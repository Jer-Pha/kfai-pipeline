Fortune.com reports King Digital Entertainment, the company behind popular Facebook games such as Candy Crush, seems to have decided that being a publicly traded entity isn't all it's cracked up to be. King announced late Monday that it's being acquired by Activision Blizzard, the makers of popular console and PC games such as Call of Duty, for 5.9 billion **** dollars. King stock price has been under pressure in part because investors are concerned that it could be a one-hit wonder or that its games might fade in popularity over time. Now King is close to 500 million monthly active users, but that number has been declining, and so have the company's revenues and profits. Candy Crush was first released in 2012 and quickly became one of the most popular Facebook games ever. Investors' concerns were most likely well placed since other Facebook and social games have lost their luster in the past. Zynga",

Investors' concerns were most likely well placed since other Facebook and social games have lost their luster in the past. Zynga was once the most dominant game maker on Facebook thanks to titles like FarmVille, but its popularity and its share price faded after the social network changed its algorithm and wasn't promoting the game as much. With the buyout, Activision is able to address one of its chief areas of weakness: mobile. Activision's stock price hit an all-time high reported today, closing up 7.5% after the King deal was made. Investors were most likely responding positively to landmark news that Activision is dropping 5.9 billion to acquire a mobile publisher, blah blah blah. But it also doesn't hurt that AC has a stellar third quarter that out-paced analytic expectations. So just for reference, EA bought PopCap back in uh 2011 for $650 million.

Yeah, they got a steal because PopCap's making, makes, you know, more than one game. Um, so this, this deal struck me as incredibly strange. Now there's, there's an important, there's an important note to be had here, and I have not looked into it too deeply, but apparently there are significant tax benefits to this deal. And I don't know the exact nature of that. I'm going to have to look into that. Maybe we can revisit it because I've just not had time to research it. But people have tweeted at me that there is an incredible tax benefit to this purchase that that benefits Activision. Um, so there's that. Here are some numbers that I was looking at and I thought was a little, that was a little strange to me, and I would be very scared if I, like, buying King for this much money is, is, is seems completely suicidal to me.

Uh, and we'll get to why. I don't know how suicidal it really is considering who's running Activision, they're not stupid people. Um, last year, 2014, net income of, so net profit, I really should say, of King after all expenses paid was about $550 million, around there, maybe a little less. They, their gross revenue is something like five times ahead of that, so probably somewhere in the line of $2 and a half billion dollars. So Activision paid 10 times the amount of the profit made last year to acquire the company and its IP. And why that's weird to me is, is, uh, the things that they talked about. Zynga is a great example of something that looked like it was going to be dominant and **** fell off the face of the planet. Um, and that was, I mean, it was so obvious that that was going to happen.

Um, and so I look at this deal and I look at it and I'm like, I just don't, why? Like, why, why would you spend this much money on this company? The, the numbers that they didn't call out here, and I'm going to call out these numbers, and I called them out on, on Colin & Greg Live. Microsoft bought Mojang, which came with it Minecraft, for $2.5 billion dollars, which is a **** steal now compared to what these things are going on. Disney bought Star Wars for $4 billion. Yeah, Star Wars, I hate to tell you, will make billions and billions and billions of dollars over the next 10 years. That was a **** shrewd buy. It was probably worth twice as much.

It's like, so $5.9 billion for King. Publicly traded people are going to **** make out as bandits. Stockholders of King are probably **** **** in their pants right now about how much money they're about to make. But the, you know, as long as the, the big thing is that the deal is not, will not go through till the spring in Ireland. And King's an Irish company. They need to, you know, they need to go through all the, the, the rigmarole over there. This just doesn't make any sense to me. They make a, they make a bunch of games, but they all are derivatives of either Candy Crush Saga or they have different, like, you know, so match-three puzzlers.

That's one in 14 people in the world are playing King games. I just don't, I just, I just don't know about that. So I don't know. That doesn't sound so crazy to me though. I mean, just in the way that like, everyone has access to something that these things are on. But what I'm wondering is, how is that number counted? Is that counted as like individual downloads of games? So if a person has five King games, are they counted five times or are they counted once for? I'm just, see, I'm seeing that number and I'm just like, that doesn't sound right. That just doesn't even sound possible. Like, just that doesn't sound possible. I could be wrong.

It's about the people that buy. And there probably are a few million people that spend money. Now these are your whales, correct? Yeah, your whales. This cannot possibly last for them because the next big thing is going to come up and take their place, just like the next big thing displaced Zynga.

He's not only a businessman, he's an incredibly successful businessman. Bobby Kotick is no dummy. So the one, the one X factor to this whole situation is like, what do you know? Because it was the same question I asked when Microsoft bought Mojang, which I thought was for a lot of money, and they got away with murder with that one. Pretty much an EA with PopCap is like, I'm sure they're looking at it being like, I'm sure the guys that own PopCap are like, ****, you know, uh, we could probably sold for a lot more. Yeah, because PopCap to me is like real, I'm not saying people at King aren't necessarily talented, I'm just saying that people at PopCap are Peggle, Peggle, and Plants vs. Zombies are already more diverse than anything that King's made.

So I think part of it is this possible tax ramification that I have to look into that might be very beneficial to them to be able to write a bunch of **** off and maybe they save millions of dollars doing it. So it's just like six and one half dozen of the other. In which case, okay, maybe they only paid in real money and a half billion dollars for the company and so it makes more sense.

Are you investing because you're not investing in their development? The thing there is, I don't think that it's, you know, am I saying it's worth it to me? No. But I'm like, you said, I'm sure I'm missing a lot. But it's the infrastructure. It's the infrastructure of marketing and getting mobile games out to people and casual games out to people. That's something that Activision doesn't really have right now in that way. No, they're not a mobile games company. So I, but now they are. Yeah, I know. You know, and I mean, but that's, that's the thing is like, now it's, it's another pillar. And with things like uh Hearthstone, which are huge and core gamers love that ****, you know, money.

Yeah, with Hearthstone, with the Candy Crush. What does that become? You know, I don't think it's so much about Candy Crush being this thing for Activision. It's more about combining the elements that make all of them work together. Just being this thing. How does it, how does it work? Like in my mind, I'm like, how does this work? If everything stays the same with King, we talked about this on Colin & Greg Live. If everything remains the same with King and they keep, they stay that the structure remains the same, the games make the same amount of money, and the status quo was kept, which is obviously not going to happen.

They're going to need new games or they're going to disappear off the **** face of the planet. But let's assume that that's the case. It will take Activision 10 years to make their money back. Now that's a good investment in a vacuum. But the, in, in games, the market's so much more dynamic and fluid than this. 10 years ago, we could not have possibly predicted where we are now. And in 10 years, the market's going to look very different again. And what will the relevance of what King does be in 10 years? I don't know. King obviously has made an asinine amount of money and, and there's no doubt. They're bigger than anyone that makes that, almost anyone that publishes or makes, you know, core triple-A games, like by a mile. So they can, they're going to laugh all the way to the bank. And this might be a very shrewd move on Activision's part. I just don't understand that King seems from an outsider's",

It seems like King preys on the things that work to get people to spend money or the whales to spend money, and they just kind of regurgitate some ideas to keep those games current. So to, in my mind, Activision is not paying for that. The Activision under their umbrella has game developers way more talented than them. So I, I think you're right that it's, it's got to be for this marketing or this reach thing. But like, why can't Activision just find that reach themselves? This is what I'm saying. There's a difference there. It's, it's a, they can, but this is different reach.

But it's like, that doesn't stop me from wanting to reach out to IGN and GameSpot and CollegeHumor and Rooster Teeth. Hey, can you promote this too? And with King, this is one of those things. Candy Crush, I mean, I see it anytime I play any mobile game. The ad comes up and it's like, you want an extra uh life for in Peggle? Then you need to watch this 10-second ad for this thing. Now Activision owns that. They can put whatever ads they want in front of that. They're going to make money from the ads. But more importantly than, than that, they can promote whatever they want.

Just because there's commercials for it and every **** game has ads for that because they bought ads in everything. So it's like, now if Activision controls that, they control so much. Like they can make anything they want popular, create totally popular. They, they, if they put ads for that everywhere, that game would sell so much more just based on people know about it. Oh, this is happening. You know, Call of Duty, I was going to sell more four. It, it's, it's, I don't know. I don't, I'm really interested in how this plays out and what their intent is.

And I'm looking at this now and I'm like, huh, I wonder if we're getting so out of control with valuations now that this sparks the beginning, the end of the boom and the bubble that we're in now in terms of tech and in terms of gaming.
