So my topic is Los Angeles, specifically our trip to Los Angeles we took. So we just talked about San Diego in the last topic real quick. We went down there to visit Sony San Diego, do Conan Live, do a Kill Screen thing. While we were doing that, you, Kevin, and Sean Finnegan went to LA and Nick, well, I'm sorry, I, I, I gave a very baby gesture similar to when Christopher Reeve got regained control of his one finger. But anyways, I gave a baby gesture. That's a real thing. I'm a big Chris Reeve fan, everybody knows that. Anyways, it's a real thing. It's that was like when we thought we were going to get it. Uh-huh. You know what I mean? As a supporter of the Reeve Foundation, we thought we almost had it when he was when he'd be talking and then he moved singer and then his wife Dana.",

He did it again. And it was like, holy ****, how is this happening? There's his body's making new neural pathways and all this stuff. Then he unfortunately died. And then of course, nobody except me supports the foundation anymore. Go support this foundation. Anyways, we were in San Diego. You guys went to LA, including Nick. Yes. And you shot a whole bunch of Love and Sex Stuff. Yeah, we did a special guest season of Love and Sex Stuff with a whole bunch of really cool people. And man, traveling is an adventure. Road trips are an adventure. I don't know how. Yeah, I hadn't done a road trip in forever. And we've done them to LA now like three times.

Anyone that's done that clarification. Going to LA is generally boring when you drive from the five, me, all the way down the five. It's made way more exciting when you have you, Kevin Coello, and Sean Finnegan in the car. Yeah, and we started having, we left late, of course. We we should have should have left at 5:00. We didn't end up getting on the road until probably like what, 6:30, 7:00. It was pretty late. So we're we're driving down the five and we look over and I'm like, holy ****, the moon's huge. And Kevin goes, you know, the moon doesn't actually change size, right? It's just when it's up in the sky, there's nothing around it. So relatively, relative like relative size speaking, when it's by buildings, you it appears much bigger than when it's up in the sky. And I was like, that is fascinating.

Like John said, catastrophic. We don't need we don't need to get need to go into it. But here, I want to hear, here's the point of the story. Was this was this we argued to the point for hours. Tim put his headphones on. I I didn't. He like crawled over. He was saying out of it. Kevin is screaming and arguing every small semantic point possible just because at like past an hour, he stopped he stopped arguing. He just wanted to piss Sean off. Sean basically was about to go to blows. I had to give them both a timeout. I was like, we need to stop talking right now for 30 minutes. Just enjoy the road.

The the very very very condensed version of this story is one time we were at Wing Stop. We had just finished eating chicken wings and they started fighting over who's faster. Decided, wait, wait, I wasn't saying I was fast. Okay, Sean Finnegan claims that he is the fastest person at IGN, hands down, no denying it. He is the fastest person. We should be. He claimed, I don't know if he still thinks he is the fastest person, but as of about a year ago, he he thought he was. I mean, he I don't know why he wouldn't because Miranda Sanchez text him right now that he is the fastest person at IGN. I know she was a fast. Kevin is like, I will beat you. I will beat you in a race like for sure. There's no doubt. And Sean gets so",

And I'm like, after you guys have just eaten **** an obscene amount of chicken wings. Yes, cool. We go in the back alley. They I'm like, all right, three, two, one, go. They both start racing. There is video footage of this. I'll try to get you that. They both start running. Within five steps, Kevin trips and falls like we always talk about him doing to catastrophic **** events. He tumbles, pops back up like a goddamn like a Kung Fu Panda, like a Kung Fu Panda. Ridiculous. Sean comes towards me, five steps away from the finish line, starts going, ow, ow, ow, because he twisted his **** leg. So now we have these two **** that just decided to race for no goddamn reason.

We decide we're going to have a rematch and make a huge thing out of it. So Sean's like, all right, I need one month to recuperate and I need one month to train. And we're all like, yeah, he like pulled something to beat Kevin in a race. You need this. He's like, yes. Then we wait. There's **** flyers made. It's a whole big deal. We go. Also, weren't the round of flyers the first ones had the wrong date? Yeah, yep. Jesus for detail. Then then we go, we do the race and it's not even close. Sean just he trained super hard.

Yeah, the the problem arguing with Kevin or doing anything with Kevin is the second you decide to be oppositional, you've lost. You've lost because Kevin doesn't care about winning the argument. He just wants the argument to go on so long that like as long as humanly possible so that he can continue to **** make fun of you and go you into more arguments. Yeah, and you get angry. You get super angry. That's what happened here. And that's why the the entire um car ride was just insane because Kevin and Sean are just fighting and reach a point that they're not even arguing about what they're arguing about.

Um, Sean Finnegan at some point said, what you got to realize is you need to stop trying to be cool and just be cool. So thank you, Sean Finnegan. How'd that relate to the moon? This is this is pre-moon. This is all pre-moon. We're just going through. We're just going through. We started talking about space at some point because there's one quote that's great that Sean said. So um, then at some point we're talking. I I remembered a story of when one of my best friends was talking about the second sexiest thing in life, linger. And we're like, no, it's lingerie. Um, wait, what Sean said that? No, but my weird talking and a story came up where my friend James Burke, linger. He was",

One of those quotes you never live down so much. Oh, he never will live it down. All right. And then we got we got Nick saying, hey, we got to stop at Del Taco. Sean saying, why'd you add an S? Nick responds, sorry, my mouth was full of McNuggets. Because we we're just leaving the McDonald's before he decided he needed Del Taco. We were I just wanted to set the the trip correct and say that we were at least going to go to Del Taco one time on the trip. And I might add, we went twice. I love Del Taco. Twice.

No, that now I got context to what the hell's happened right here. We start getting into the moon conversation, right? Don't tell me you wouldn't want to be a **** space captain. Sean Finnegan later, Finnegan to Nick, the moon isn't actually growing, dumb ****. In terms of how far far away the moon. No, he didn't said it to me. I think he just said, I think he said it to Kevin. No, he said it was to you. Was it to me? Mhm. Now go punch him. Why did he say that to me? Moon is actually getting further away. You made a joke and he took it seriously. Oh, okay. I was like, wait, I didn't say the big small.

You have any you have any questions about space? SpaceAnswers.com is your place. Gotcha. Is that run by Neil deGrasse Tyson? No, wait a minute, it's not. Now you think that nothing would happen if the Moon disappeared if like just disappeared, right? I feel like what about the tidal effect and all that? Yeah, what are you talking about? It only controls like 60% of the. We still we almost text you by the way. We almost text you. I was like, can I call can I phone a friend? Can I call call it in on this? Also causes tidal effect. Sure. Everything. Anything big like change the world. I think it would. Kevin's Kevin's argument is that it wouldn't destroy. No, but it would it would it would upend and disrupt everything.

We said there would be a cataclysmic change. No, I don't think there would be a cataclysmic change. But if the moon never if if there was never a moon, we would never we wouldn't even be here because it stopped so many asteroid collisions, right? So I think the conclusion we came to is yes, there would be some dramatic effects as to how long those effects would take. But how did we get to that? Because eventually now Nick is on Yahoo Answers. I had to go down. I had to get the real answers. Greg, Space Answers is good. Yahoo Answers is better because it's crowdsourced. It really is. And you get some genius answers on Yahoo Answers.

They only have like very short spans because for a number of reasons, psychological and also they they're not new anymore. So they have to continue to kind of do crazier and crazier things.

All of us in black leotards with those **** little ears, maybe a tail, and like the black whisker paint. And it would have been the funniest **** thing ever. But I but I wanted leotard like they had in like um Cats where it went down to your belly button. You know what I mean?

That was a particular mistake on our part. We decided to drive toward Hollywood after we saw the uh Jobs. And I was like, oh, let's go for a drive. There's a bunch of trick-or-treaters. And we got stuck in literally four hours of traffic because they shut down Hollywood. They shut down like uh Highland and and and Hollywood Boulevard. And anywhere in like a 40 mile or maybe maybe not 40 miles, but like anywhere like a three or four mile radius is gridlock.

That's that's 4 ounces of bourbon and I was feeling it so I was feeling it so so hard, otherwise known as a bottle bottle of it. It was like a rough, rough day for me and I was so tired. I just wanted to go home and sleep. I did not want to go out and do any of the parties or anything. I was like, uh, but it's me. I'm not going to f*** be like, let's go back.

It was the first time in my life where I had spent days just driving around LA for work and it was very fascinating 'cause the city had always been very big to me.

So we got stuck in that for a little bit. But then that was hilarious 'cause it was, it was like the difference between the Halloween parties and the cosplayers. Yeah, so like hardcore people that actually show up and look awesome versus the dude that just painted his face silver and was like the Silver Surfer cat thing nipples, cat nipples. Yeah, all all six of them. Do cats have six nipples, Kevin? Yeah, all right. Yeah, they do. If Pory does, they do. It was fun. It was, we had a great time and it was, it was cool to go on road trip.

Okay, uh, are most acts driven by selfish, just selfish, uh, motivations? And that when again, another just another argument drove down. Really, I mean, that went from civil to 10 minutes later, Sean and Kevin again hating each other. No, it was Nick. I didn't really care about. Yeah, I know. But ask Sean. We were screaming at each other in the car, not screaming, but very, very loudly talking to each other in the car.

Yeah, well, but see, that's there's a there's an art to How to Have Sex for the First Time review. Um, so yeah, so we went down. We did a lot of the episodes. We did some with uh, Chloe Dykstra, Ava Gordy, Trisha Hershberger, the girls from Just Between Us, Anthony Carboni. Um, we're missing some people. Mari Takahashi, uh, Jen Shire from Smosh Games. And I think that's it. That was fun. It was interesting because we went from people's houses to like, we went to Defy Media, which is where Smosh is uh, is based out of. It just, it was, it was cool.
