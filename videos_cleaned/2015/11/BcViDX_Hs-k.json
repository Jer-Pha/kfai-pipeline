Like, I'm telling you, you keep telling me you want to cut it. I'm saying keep, let it go. The kids have, they've been well spoken, outspoken, some Wellen. They've been well spoken and outspoken that they want to see the Colin Moriarty fro we hear so much about from back in college when you didn't know any better. Women already hate me. Can you imagine how much women are going to hate me if I have? Would want to be you even more. Look at this guy giving no ****s with his hair. That's who I want to be. I have no ****s left to give about literally anything at all, right? Literally anything, right? So just do it. We'll see. Just don't go super short.

I don't know. I'm sure a video game brought it up. Playing Fallout 4, they got a whole bunch of memory stuff you doing there. They got a memory den and things like that.

When we did Podcast Beyond, uh, last year at PSX, we were the only Standing Room panel.

And I know that you're going to fill that room up in the Venn diagram of PS I Love You XOXO and PlayStation. It's like overlapping. It's just one circle. There's very few people, I would think, who don't know of the show. Probably a few don't like us, but very few. The people are going to come to this panel. It's exciting.

And reading, reading all the stories and fan reactions about it. It was interesting because people are thinking maybe we'll hold back some story or stuff like that.

Then obviously, we don't have the resources to work on it because everyone's working on the game. We just know that we're going to do it. Ellipsis. It may be scary from the outside to say this, but we don't have a franchise plan or anything or even a big idea of where anything is going.

We've always said to ourselves internally that when we're in the pre-production stage, we're trying to figure out what type of game we're trying to make. Do we continue the series or not? If things don't feel fresh or if it doesn't feel like we have actual story to tell, it doesn't feel like we're able to try new things or innovate with gameplay, then we'll start thinking about stepping away from it. Every time it's worked out in that we're like, oh yeah, we have a story to tell now with moving to the PS4 and being able to take everything we learned from the previous three games and apply it here. And looking at where the story arcs went for the first three games, it feels like the natural time to step away. It was something we were coming to realize in the early phases of development that it was feeling like the right time. End quote. So it answers the question I was posing, is it time?

Fully 68% of adults, and this is a presumably in the United States since it's Pew Research now, uh nearly doubled the share of the Pew Research Center measured in the first survey on smartphone ownership in 2011.

And she writes later on, game console ownership is where it was in 2010. Now I have a problem with this because on me, we are counting in 2010 the Wii in addition of PS3 and 360. And I don't really consider that a tradition gaming console. And I don't think most people would. Um and you're and for the record, you're not doing it as a knock or a shot against Nintendo.

Hence the company's high expectations for the upcoming Star Wars multiplayer shooter Battlefront. Meanwhile, PlayStation Europe Boss Jim Ryan told MCV that the third-party partnerships had began cobbling together before PlayStation 4's launch will continue. Quote, we are going to be strong with games that we have developed and we will publish, but third-party partnerships continue to be important to us. The days of a platform holder working in isolation are long gone. It is a connected ecosystem and relationships with publishers operate on many levels. They will certainly continue to be really important in 2016. End quote. I can't but help wonder if the the days of a platform holder working in isolation or long gone is a comment being made indeed in isolation or if that's a shot at Nintendo because like I'm reading into it.
