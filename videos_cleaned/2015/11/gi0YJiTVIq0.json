All right, I haven't. You've never had a DQ Blizzard with some Whoppers in there? DQ is not a thing around here in the Bay Area. So, I love DQ. Look at that, the Peanut Buster Parfait.

Rite Aid, you asked me before this podcast, what's Rite Aid do? I would have said they're like a Walgreens. They, but they serve ice cream in squares. Yeah, it's weird. They have a little ice cream stand. The scooper is like the shape of this cup, a little bit smaller, so it, the, the, the scoop of ice cream comes out looking like the tip of this mic.

Um, you do talk about Bond a lot, but we've never had his topic, have we? I do. I, I don't know that we have necessarily. I mean, I've brought him up multiple times. Um, Tim, you saw the new James Bond: Spectre? Yeah, so I mean, I don't know. I, I want to gauge how you guys feel about this because sadly, I'm becoming less and less of a Bond fan.

And we're talking about 50 some odd years of, of, of a franchise. And so what I, what I kind of had the realization on this one was, although it's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, it's well made. The action's cool. Very, okay. It's, it's just that every single thing in it feels oddly reminiscent of every movie that came before it. And that's starting to wear on me a little bit.

And Daniel Craig was like that, the four so far that it's kind of like The Dark Knight Trilogy of the grounded.

I don't know if they got, they've cleared that up or not. But yeah, he's supposed to do five. This is number four. And it's interesting because it's gone full circle with me. He did Casino Royale, which was a really cool reboot, right? It's very much what Tim's talking about, which is like a Nolan-esque reboot of like, let's, let's ground this a little bit more in reality.

And now we're sort of at that place where nothing really matters because nothing's grounded in reality. You don't have that much of an emotional connection to the character anymore. And I'm sure you, I don't know if you felt that or not in this, but you're just kind of like, eh, I don't really care what happens. No, I mean, well, that totally, that sums up this movie. And I think the problem with that is the way that these movies function. Like they, they're sequels to each other, but it almost as if they don't expect you to have watched the other ones, you know?

And they had like very, very straightforward. They weren't even subtle. It was like the original car comes back and with the ejector seat and all that stuff. And you see sort of updated versions of that here. Um, but one of the things they wanted to do is they wanted to tie in the original evil organization Spectre, which prior to this had been Quantum.
