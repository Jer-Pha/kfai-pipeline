Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Call of Duty: Black Ops, Call of Duty: Black Ops. Um, well, there's got to be a Halo on this list, right? Okay, I I can say I I can probably name four off my head, but it's funny because this list will always change. This that's fun of the discussion. I talk about video games like I do food. People always ask like, what's your favorite food? If you could eat one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be? I'm like, nothing. That'd be hell. You end up getting sick of it no matter what. You're there's there's a place in Austin called Torchy's Tacos. Yes, we know it well. Really good, right? And you don't have it in San Francisco, so every time you go there, it's a treat. Yeah, I think we had it like four days in a row. I'm like, shit, I hate Torchy's. You can't you can't do that to yourself. You can't binge on stuff and think you're going to appreciate it.",

You can't binge on stuff and think you're going to appreciate it at some point. So like for me, it's right now it's almost like nostalgic and like like off top of my head, it's basically Halo 1, Kingdom Hearts I or II, kind of. Which one? Kingdom Hearts II had two swords. Yeah, I think I like II more. Me too. I my thing is with II, it's like one, yeah, it was the original on this and that, but II played better. The controls were better. It was more epic. The fight against the thousand freaking Heartless. I was like, you won me over. And the shit, oh, just Cloud and Squall together. Like, are you kidding me? Yeah, yeah, it was basically, yeah, it was a teenage masturbation for me. That's the sort of stuff I masturbated to. Uh, yeah, yeah, Halo 1, Kingdom Hearts II, Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid 3, uh, Subsistence, not or Substance? I think was it Substance? Subsistence? Substance?",

Why Halo 1? Um, it was it was the game that made first-person shooters work on a console for me. Mhm. For most, I think. Yeah, that's what really redefined. Well, was the I think the twin-stick shooter, you know, GoldenEye. Sure, good point. It was it, yeah, I I never really gotten GoldenEye. I didn't know an N64. And like, Halo for me, my first experience with it was multiplayer. Like, I had like a birthday party and my friend brought his Xbox over. I'm like, this just makes sense. It makes sense to me. Everything clicked. Like, I even played with the shitty Duke controller. Oh, yeah. And I remember getting an S and being like, Oh my God, life is great. Um, yeah, it just it just it was the",

I'm about to buy a $150 controller just so I can play the game better. Yeah, I mean, but it's worth it. That's a great it's an investment. The Achievement Hunters got it and I I used it for a little bit. I'm like, I can't go back. Yeah, you can actually aim. It feels so good. Um, and then I remember just being blown away by the single player. Like, that first opening mission. I was like, it was just I was I was at a friend's house because I didn't have an Xbox. They were downstairs, I think, playing like World of Warcraft. I was upstairs. I just remember being like, this game is awesome. Yeah, I I'm in a spaceship and exploded.

I mean, Hal, yeah, Halo 1 is so special to me for the same reasons, both campaign and multiplayer. Like, I think my first twin-stick shooter, uh, was TimeSplitters on PS2. And I loved that for the quirky story and for whatever, but the it felt like GoldenEye, just like where same guys, right? Yeah, exactly. And it felt that way. And it was like, you the aiming is kind of it wasn't it felt cartoony. Yeah, I always thought that was a weird thing that they carried over to TimeSplitters that um, GoldenEye did where because it wasn't a twin-stick shooter, GoldenEye being what it was, you'd have to stop, hold aim. And then I was like, okay, that that was a limitation. And then, uh, TimeSplitters, a TN, and they still had that mechanic. Please stop.",

And I remember controlling the Warthog for the first time being like, this doesn't make any shit sense. Then all of a sudden it clicked. I'm like, this makes more sense than any shit vehicle ever did. Like, just the weight and everything. Like, I was just it just it was a game that just worked. I don't know. It's hard to explain. Like, when you feel it for the first time. Like I said, most of the picks that I have are almost just deep rooted in nostalgia. But I mean, you were talking about the campaign. Like, I'll never forget the Silent Cartographer level, which is like the third level in the game.

I just did a I did just replayed it with Lawrence. We did a co-op mission for it, uh, with Master Chief Collection. When it works, it's great. Uh, but co-op kept kicking us out and it sucked. But when we did that level, we landed. I was just like, hard on, this is so good. Like, it even because they did the remaster thing with it, so it still feels good. Like, I get that nostalgic ping of like, can't believe the game's 10, 11 years old now. Yeah, we're old. We are. We're very old. Yeah. Um, I don't know. I kind of need help with a fifth. What's a good like classic game that everyone renowned as like Mario? Any Mario on that list? Mario? Because that kind of rounds out your list. That's lazy. I don't. Um, oh, you know what?

But um, I put a lot of hours in Majora. Yeah, you know what it was? Because and like, I I base a lot of these on like personal memories of. And Majora's Mask was that game where I had the I had the strategy guide and I was getting all I was doing that last Fierce Deity Mask, uh, to get, you know, I have to get all the mask. And it you have to have you done this where you have to like, you go through the entire day. There there was a story that plays through all three days and you have to be at the right place at the right time to do all these things.

And um, yeah, that was that was like that that game just it just brings so many memories. No, I mean, when I think back to both those games, that's the same thing. Ocarina of Time was such a special one for me, right? Because it was my first Zelda. My friend had to convince me to play it, right? And I came home and I put it in and like, just gone. You know what I mean? Just gone playing that game. A Link to the Past was my I'm A Link to the Past guy. I I never played the first one on NES. It just looked way too hard for me.

Yeah, I've played it since. Yes, yes. They're almost remakes of each other. Exactly. Kind. And that's the thing is like that and I wonder how much that is, 'cause every Zelda since Majora's Mask, right? I'm always like, can we stop telling the same shit story over and over again? It is, you know, it's there's dungeons there. Then eventually you need to collect three things. Then there's an alternate version of the same place you're in where you need to get five or seven more things.

Yeah, I am the NX's biggest fanboy. But uh, it hit a point where Zelda and Mario and Metroid and all that, they every game previously had a different art style and a different feel, did something unique. And then hit a point where it's like just sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel. And it's like, how come we haven't like, you look at Mario 1, you look at Mario 2, you look at Mario 3, you look at Mario World, you look at Mario World 2. Yeah, those are all you look at Mario 64, different games, totally different art styles, different look, different feel. And then New Super Mario Bros. And now every game since then looked like that.

Yeah, so PlayStation was 32-bit. Oh, no, no, but uh, um, but Nintendo never did it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, interesting. But I I'm even just talking about art style, you know, like, you look at they just kind of once they hit Mario 64, gave Mario a voice. That's what Mario is. I think after uh, Sunshine, he's kind of looked the same and done the same. I I don't know. I mean, it seems to work for them. And I mean, for sure it does. Games are still good. They're not they're never going to be the perfect life-changing experience. Then Galaxy happened. So I guess I'm just spitting shit.

I'm I'm almost positive Nintendo's looking at that and like, let's keep Mario wholesome. Let's just keep him what he is. And if it's not broke, don't fix it. Sonic's very broken. Sonic's a shit joke at this point. Me, Sonic never made the jump to 3D. People say he with Adventure, but he didn't. Sad. He's funnier on 4chan than anything else. Yeah, it's just the weirdest thing.

Yeah, they said first on PlayStation. The Cloud announced for Smash Bros. I was like, something's going on. I I want to say it's going to be a launch game. It's not going to be a launch game. That game is impossible. So far off. Yeah. Uh, now that it's becoming more and more real, I'm getting a bit more excited for Final Fantasy VII Remake. Mhm. 'Cause that is one of my favorite games of all time. Well, okay, yeah. So going on that, that Final Fantasy VII is one of my favorite games of all time. I don't think top five, but it first Final Fantasy. Um, I played X first, which is probably not the best one to go into. I was just young, so that's how that worked. People don't go",

I love X, but I think it's a nostalgia thing. Um, I do love the battle system. I think it's amazing. But VII is VII's great. And um, going back to it, it still did hold up, not graphically or anything, but in all the other ways. Um, so people are either really excited for the reboot or like hating it because they want an exact reboot. What are your thoughts on it? I I don't know what I want now. It's been so long. And I think Kingdom Hearts kind of became my new Final Fantasy where I was like, oh, the combat's good. Then it went away for five years or whatever. Just don't get into bed with Disney.

But regardless, I'm saying like, combat wise, I was like, yeah, Kingdom Hearts figured it out. It's fun. I they made an RPG. Cool. Final Fantasy VII is like, it's so dated. I don't know if you can change it. I don't know. I don't know if you can update it today. Sanders, and I love Final Fantasy. I love Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Still makes me feel weird.

But like, I love the world that they built. And I love that were like, this there's this weird clash. It was so unique. Advent Children came out like, oh, looks like every other anime. It looks like every other anime. It's super dark. And all of a sudden Cloud's like, they just ruined Cloud's character. He went from being this guy that like had issues, but was still kind of fun and like did the whole cross-dressing thing and all of that. And then you get Advent Children and he's just a Hot Topic.

And a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but I'm like, I think that they should update it. They should do things. The battle system is going to be different. The b- if that battle system was in a modern game, it wouldn't make sense. No, because we progressed since then. I don't I mean, they might try to make it like the new what is it called now? Final Fantasy XV. It's not Versus. Shit, that naming. Final Fantasy XV. Dudes in a car. Dudes in a car. That that demo didn't play too well for me. It was okay.
