M, all right , so because we have Alfredo on this show, I feel like, don't shake your head at me, Kevin, you knew what you're getting yourself into. You quit, my God. I feel like this topic is is very appropriate. Alfredo's here, episode 69, it's been a long time [Music] coming. I like Colin's noise. You got to wait for that. By the way, Colin is what makes it funny. It's not, it's only, it's scummy. Colin doesn't get into it. Yeah, it's normal if it's me. Alfredo's just being nice. Then when Colin does it, it's like we got, we got it, we hit something, we hit a residence. So my topic is dating in the modern world. Oh man. So Nick , for the uninitiated, what do that, like this means? It's, it's crazy. It's a whole new world where everything's really easy and it's just thrown at you and it just doesn't make sense and um, so it's easy, you're saying it's easy? Oh yeah, finding quality, that's a whole another story. Find the a real relationship, a quality relationship, much hard sexually dating or",

I've, okay, I mean, start at the beginning. Well, I mean, here's, here's my thing, like Greg, us, we've talked about Tinder before and Tinder is just like, it's this crazy, it's the, you know, the best iOS game of 2013, 2014. It, it's just crazy. It allows you to literally just say yes or no to people on would you **** bang, don't want to bang. Wow, that's nuts. But it's like beyond that, it's like there's all these online dating sites and we're at the point now where that's not a weird thing. It's a normal thing. That's like if you don't, if you have no story of online dating at some point, it's kind of weird. I don't know about that. Are you kidding me? Well, I'm talking about people my age, my , my experiences don't come from Tinder, they",

You got girls over Twitter this, it starts going up a second. The thing that no one's really understanding right now, the freaking Underdog is Uber Pool. Oh my God , Uber Pool, Uber Pool, a practical Implement that could be used for dating. Oh my God, it's where it's at because **** Tinder, **** this yes or no ****. Uber Pool is, hey, a stranger's going to get in the car with you, probably going to go somewhere where they're trying to have and you're for it's in the same dire, you're going any moment you could be like, hey, uh, just I'll go with her. Mhm, done. And this happens. So yeah, so, so there's so many times where I would just, I just start taking Uber Pool back from from IGN after work. I'd just Uber Pool",

I, where, who the **** cares? I'm just gonna take it. No, that's the other thing. Uber Pool is $5. It's like five if you do it within SF. So it's like **** cheap as ****. You just pay $5 and you just r yeah, exactly. So I would, when I was at working at IGN, I would get off, I'd hit the Uber Pool, then it'd ping for someone else and be like, oh, it's a chick. All right. Anyways, so like you get picked up or she get picked up first and then you're in this ride and with this person, this female and you're stuck together for a good half hour. So you have a good half hour to spit game, make it work, make a twerk, you know what I mean?

That's how it **** happens. That's how it is. But I mean, the thing with with Uber though, it's it could half the time it's a dude . So it's like whatever, it's just a normal ride home. But there's always that time where it's like, oh, it's a lady, you know, and then this literally makes me want to be an Uber Pool driver just to make videos out of you taking Uber Pools with women just like genius.
