We're going into the Screw Attack game thing. We're going to Momo Con. I want to know Twitch Con, that's that's coming up. We won't for San FRC conventions, we don't work that hard. Um I want to know everyone at the table their best convention memory and worst convention memory. I can't even get into mine. Oh, you need to bring somebody on. Mine's the whole whole rigmarole the R so you guys continue. I I think that this I think this E3 coming up will be my 10th and I think that the the first one I went to was 2004 and that was just a great memory for me because I felt like I had made it in some respect when I finally had gone and it was a that was when they're showing World of Warcraft for the first time, Resident Evil 4 was there for the first time which was like really awesome, Doom 3 was there so it was like there was just a lot of good games",

Like so like there was video in 20 04 but you didn't have YouTube and like no one was really watching game trailers. You weren't like downloading **** EGS of **** so I I never really you had like screenshots but never really had an idea of what it was like, right? And so that was just really memorable to me because I've been to scores of shows now I mean like all over the world but that first show regardless of what was being shown there was just a really surreal moment",
