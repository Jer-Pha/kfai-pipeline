And that's the kind of stuff I started thinking about where they like Greg is able to really not fuse these things together and I find it really hard not to because religion is the study of God or the belief in God or Gods if you're polytheistic and that's totally fine and no one's right or wrong. Um, we've gotten a little way from the centralized question what the proof we need is, but to me it really all spurred from the fact that like wow, I never really realized as as someone who really I think understands the Bible better than normal Layman although not as well as obviously as a theological scholar or a hardcore Christian because I don't where I was like wow, like we really don't believe in visual proof even though the people that were all subjects in this book had visual",
