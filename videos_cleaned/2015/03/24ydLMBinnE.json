But to your point earlier, I'm sorry I interrupted you, but but that's why I always advocate not getting into a serious relationship until you're getting closer to 30, cuz you really don't necessarily know who you are until you hit about 25, 26, right? And you have that sort of that sort of period where you know you're not on the same wavelength with a woman, then you hit 25 and you guys can kind of understand if you're going to be compatible going forward together, if you're going to compliment each other's lives .

I can't even imagine who I would be right now if I didn't have my wife. I'd probably be rotten. I'd be rotten. You'd be in Asia somewhere getting lost.
