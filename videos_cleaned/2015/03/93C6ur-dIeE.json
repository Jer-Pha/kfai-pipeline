            "text": "Greetings and salutations, welcome back to Kinda Funny Games. My name is Colin Moriarty, this is Nick Scarpino, and Nick, we're here today to talk about a special PlayStation 4 game that we were very excited to play. We've had it for a little while, finally everyone can play it. It's called Axiom Verge. Now, so good. I'm starting at the Cross Media Bar on PS4. They don't really even call it that anymore, it's a PS3 thing. We're going to call it Cross Media Bar because you wanted to start at the very, very beginning. Hear that? That jam, you're like, okay, this is cool. You know, you get a sense of the art style right here, uh, and you're like, okay, well, it's loading. It doesn't really tell you it's loading, but you can assume it's loading. Here it is. You're like, that's kind of dope, right? Very nice. Oh, that that beat, that bass kicks it, that that back beat. Oh yeah. All right, now this is going to be kind of a unique let's play for us because this is going to be a let's play and kind of a review. I've not beaten the game. I",

I've not beaten the game. I don't know where I am in the game. I'm somewhere somewhat far in the game. You have beaten the game completely and we're going to just start one of my missions up. I think I'm like 3 hours in or not even two and a half hours. Okay. And I've got about 16% of the map and 5% of the items were vice versa. I don't map. That's that's what I thought might might have said that made a little more sense. It makes more sense. Uh, so here you're seeing this is cool. This is one of the various checkpoints or save points rather. And the game has a lot of these, which is nice. So every time you get past a nice section, a hard section, you can bet that there's probably going to be a healthy amount of save points, uh, which makes you a little bit more bold. Um, now this actually is a great stage to show show off some of the",

Um, R1, not R. So now you'll notice something crazy and when he shoots that out, you let it go over. It's okay. Now it's blue. So the cool thing about this game is that when you use, you get you get a multitude of items and weapons and whatnot, but you can actually each each one of the each every time you meet a villain, villain, every time you meet an enemy rather, if you hit him with a disruptor, it does certain things. Some enemies it slows down, some enemies that actually uh, turns you to your side. So if you hit that guy for instance, hit him with disruptor. There you go. Now let him shoot at you, kind of lead him a little bit over on the other side. Now see, he just revealed oh, a section that",

Now see, he just revealed oh, a section that you can go in now, which you wouldn't have known about before. And that actually makes it a lot easier when you're first starting off, especially in the section where you're at right now, cuz you don't have a lot of health and you don't have a lot of uh, you know, you're not really leveled up yet. So now you can kind of skip through that. So if you hit that first person with it, you can skip the whole thing and go all the way. Oh, interesting sense. Yeah. And that the game's kind of like that where you just sort of happen and discover those things and you're like, holy C crap. Now, of course, later you get another power that will allow you just to kind of go through some of those walls. Um, I'm getting killed too. You're getting wrecked. It's been a while.

I got some code. I'm I'm warm if that's what you're asking. No, you're you're good. Um, so yeah, basically the game is like this, you know, it's a it's we we've talked about this in NA, we've shown it a few times, but the game is very much like Metroid where you hit the hit this pad, you can see sort of where your map is right now. So you've already uncovered five of the worlds or five of the levels rather. Yeah. And you can go through scroll here there. Yeah, there's plenty. But actually are you're pretty far along.

For some people, you know, um, I don't know if you're going to like a game that requires this much exploration, cuz the map doesn't really show you a lot of things. No, no. Um, it really is just kind of barebones map, but it can actually be quite illuminating as far as some of the secret levels. And there there's plenty of little secret passageways and various things, uh, that you can find in the game that if if this is your type of game, if you like this kind of gameplay, you're going to love this, I think. Um, I played they say it's about 10 hours long. I've about 5 hours of it. So wow, you played that much? Yeah, because I'm trying to complete the whole thing and I just cannot find the last 5% of the map. I'm at about 78% of the items and in 95% of the map and I just cannot get that",

I don't like using it. There you go. Now you can just kind of go. Now I'm trying to I wonder I wonder if this is the place I'm supposed to go next. Let's look. No, this is where I just was. So I think I got to keep climbing. You got to keep going. And I got this little like, well, I guess I I I took some damage, so I don't have the Scorpion Tail thing anymore. No, that thing is one of those things where I I don't know what what the whole point of that is per se yet. It's cool.

So you've only got oh, you got the you got two of the the weapons that you're probably going to end up using the whole game, which is which is your uh, normal disruptor and the Kilver, I think is what it's called. Yeah, the lightning bolt. That thing's badass. It's like the shotgun the game. And what I like about it is it actually goes through levels or it goes through uh, areas in the game. So you can do you have the Drone yet? No, that's what I fig. I need to have you get the Drone. Um, but this thing's like a shotgun. It'll actually go through those those platforms, which is cool. So yeah, this is the do you have the dash yet? No, yeah, I do. What is it? It's a double right? Yeah, yeah, there you go. So where do you think we should go from here? Uh, I let's look at the map.

Those are devastating. Now those things if you use the if you use the uh, I'm I'm killing the name. What? Go to the menu real quick so I can figure out the name of this thing. Uh, go down to the little disruptor down there. What's it called? This thing? The Field Disruptor. Yeah, so the Field Disruptor is what? Oh, this thing here. I see. That's the thing you end up using a lot. Do you have the uh, you don't have a claw yet, do you? No. Is that what? So do I need like a better disruptor to get through?

This reminds me of actually I remember going to the screen. This reminds me of Rygar, you remember that game, the NES game? Oh, we should look it up later. It just reminds me a lot of it. I feel like it has to be intentional. So the the story behind this game, by the way, is that you play as Trace, which is the character you're seeing right there. Um, and you get sucked into this other world. Now there's all sorts terminology and it's not I'll be honest with you, a lot of the story fell on deaf ears when it came to me. I just I it didn't really track. I don't know how you feel about that, but I just I'm like, I think it's purposely supposed to be a little cheesy. Yeah, I think it's it's supposed to be supposed to be kind of 80s or 90s. Yeah, a little up.

And I think it's I think it's purposely doing that, which is kind of cool, cuz you you have his dialogue where he's like, all right, I'm not really sure what you meant by that, but I guess I'll go do what you tell me to do. Um, which is cool. But the story is you get you get sucked in this world and there are these gigantic beings, one of which you saw at the very beginning in the in the uh, intro menu, um, the title menu rather. And they're asking you to go kill the big bad guy. And there's some twists and turns. I'm not going to spoil any of that stuff for you, but basically you're on a mission to save this these these parallel cre these creatures in this parallel universe, um, from destruction.

And for people that are curious, by the way, we already touched on it, but the reason I'm able to go through that is I get a move where I double tap left or right. It's your lab coat. It's it's the lab coat I'm wearing. So this you get the upgrade a lab coat, um, and they it allows you to actually phase through one level of wall per. Yeah, see, I don't know if you can get over this yet. Yeah, I wonder where I'm supposed to go next. This is where I stop. So I'm I'm a little confused at where I'll just keep backtracking and see what happens. So yeah, I mean, this is this is what the game is a lot of. So, you know, it's a lot of exploration. It's a lot of looking through your map and uh, let me see where your map is. Hold on. It's going to reload here. Let's see.",

Did this one through this door here? Let's try it. Now, how often? I mean, this is a good question for you because I haven't found myself like totally lost in the game yet, but have did you find yourself like really like tragically lost at all in the game? Uh, you do. You go through a period where you're like, I don't know where any of this is. And then eventually you learn the maps like after hour 10, you learn the maps. Um, um, and you start to kind of understand, okay, how they flow, how they build together. And you start to negotiate them fairly quickly. Uh, however, that is kind of one of the drawbacks of the game is that there is no fast travel system. You are just you",

You are just you got if you want to get from one of that to the other, they have a little bit of that built in and you'll see that once you get um, once you're able to make that jump in the the other land where there's kind of a a being that will take you all the way across the map if you stay on her and it goes pretty fast. Um, but there's a reason why you have to keep going back and exploring other stuff, cuz as you increase your abilities, obviously you start to there you go. But I don't have I I don't have the Drone or whatever I need. You do not have the Drone yet. Show you what's down here. I would use the Kilver on those bad ****. These guys here. Yeah, you got that shotty. I don't I'm not going to use. There's a there is a quick switch on the on the on the sticks, right? Yeah, there you go. Boom Boom Stick. There you go.",

Well, there's your yeah, those are the quick yeah, so we can so you can just start firing and shooting and aiming. That's incredibly helpful. That's useful to know. Very useful. Probably very very something that you should get used to right now. Um, okay. So let's keep backtracking then. See where else we can go. Yep. We are seeing a nice variety of maps. Nonetheless, this is a kind of a midpoint of the game, I would say. Not maybe not even. No, you're about a quarter of the way through. Um, how much bigger does the map get? I feel like I feel like I've seen so much of the game. It gets big. Um, kind of excited to play more, but I kind of just wanted on Vita. Oh yeah, this",

You're going to spend a lot of hours playing this, cuz I just enjoy once you level up too, you go you jump back into your old save and you just wreck things. Like you're unstoppable toward the end of the game. Plus if you get certain weapons, um, of which I've only have half. I only have half the weapons. There probably all told, uh, what's three rows of like probably 18 to 20 weapons in the game to put it in context. Um, as well as a number of items. I have every item except for one, which is annoying. I and some I'm just rushing through by the way, so we can get new part, right? Um, there we go. Trying to think what you need for this. You need that second disruptor, but I got just keep going left. Keep going this way and see what's",

Keep going this way and see what's over. Destroy these things. Love that you can get a nice trophy for for destroying some of the bubbles in this area, by the way. Um, if you use your disruptor on this guy, it turns him. So this is a cool thing. Go up and use the disruptor on one of these guys. Oh, you know, it's not strong enough yet. Never mind. So you really did run around using the disruptor, huh? I'm just going to say, well, when you get the second disruptor, it becomes very very helpful. For instance, with those guys, um, on level two, if you hit them with that, they turn from spreading out those little bad guys, spreading out life. Oh, so they'll actually be like in certain levels, you have to start and you have to get really especially when there's some uh, the boss battles involved because on some like this first boss battle, you go in and it",

Certain boss battles, you can actually exit out, go get more health somewhere and come back. And so you have you have to start managing those resources fairly quickly, um, toward the end of the game if you want to beat some of the bosses. Otherwise, it's just not going to work. You're just going to get destroyed. So I feel like I'm we'll just go in this direction and see what happens. I feel like there might be something over here that we didn't do yet. Um, those guys are annoying too. Those these particular guys see you and then run at you and you got to gun up and they get worse. Well, the cool the other cool thing about the game is this, um, um, sorry, I'm just watching you play. No, no, it's okay. When you go back to these other levels though, they don't get harder.

It actually becomes fun fighting these guys, cuz they come at you and you just blow them away. Yeah, they're right now a little scary, but they give you a lot of life. They do give you a lot of life. And uh, you can see here the thing we talking about a little Scorpion Tail that I have that gives me like an extra bullet basically. And that was another upgrade that you got from the ethereal beings that you're fighting for to give you a little blood upgrade. So can I get at full health? You you can go through all these.

I was trying to up, but I you go all the way up. What's up there? Like up to the left, right? So I think I'm going to have to go back down and then up that tunnel. Yeah, you're going to. So let's try that. You can go through that, by the way. This way here. Say, I think you can phase through those. No, you can, but I think it's a oh, can I keep? I see where you're saying.

Um, but yeah, you have to get good because some of the uh, you get quite a few weapons in the game, some of which I don't think are are are useful at all. There's about three main weapons that I use toward the end of the game. Um, do you think there might be a secret here? There might be. I don't even remember this.

Yeah, this this is actually was one of the hardest parts in the game for me when I first got here, cuz there's those guys are fine, but the um, so yeah, you start to learn as as you do with any platformer like this where you need to be to hit those guys.
