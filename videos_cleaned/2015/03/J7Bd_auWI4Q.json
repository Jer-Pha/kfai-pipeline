They in the playoffs yet? Is it playoff time? No, not yet, but they'll make it. They'll be fine. They play the Rangers tonight. I have hope. They'll clinch probably in the next couple weeks, and then the playoffs start in April. When does the puck drop? The puck drops today at 4 o'clock. That was my favorite thing when we went to Boston, is Colin kept saying, oh yeah, the puck drops at 4.30. It's just like, wow, that's a thing. That's what they say. It's a real thing. Oh yeah. Over there, the pure one, Tim Gettys. Let's get nasty. Oh my goodness. That's a different. Over here, the producer slash seducer, Nick Scarpino. Go Devils. No, everybody!

There are Huskies involved. Just because you like dogs? What type of Huskies? Oh, I like Huskies. At Northeastern, we have a real Husky named Scout. Of course, Scout the Husky. I think it's Scout the 6th now or something like that. Does he live on campus? Does the dean take care of it? I don't know, I just see him every once in a while. We have a statue of a Husky too that everyone rubs his nose. Sure, good luck. You gotta do that. But you don't do that with a real Husky. That's what we have Kevin for. We can do that with Thomas Jefferson. We just have people rub his nose. They rub Thomas Jefferson's dick. You sit next to him and then it's what, Francis? Whatever, it doesn't matter.
