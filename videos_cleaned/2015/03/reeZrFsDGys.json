You start talking about The Killing Joke. You like comics. Then during it, you reveal you're a DC comic fanboy over Marvel, just like me. So, we're kindred spirits on that. I didn't know this. Then we're out at the table and we're talking about comics and you said, \"Man, it's just I get excited to talk about comics because no one else talks about comics and I want to talk about Saga.\" I'm like, \"I want to talk about Saga.\" All these different things. It So, here's my question. This is my topic. Why Why aren't comics more popular? What the hell's going on? Because this is going back to this Bat girl thing.

These clearly weren't all comic book fans getting mad about it. These are people who just saw the image and now have an opinion about it. Are they mad about it because it looked like it was violence against women? That that it wouldn't be Well, it was also infantilizing Batgirl. That's how it was interpreted. Okay.

Um, there's all these different things to it, but again, so much fervor about it from people I know, not that people I know aren't, but the number of people that aren't really reading comics, they're seeing an envision, reacting to it, they're reacting to a piece of art. So, this just got that's not really what we're talking about. Sure. But it's more about the fact why aren't comics more popular? I think the easy answer is that comic books are the nerdiest of all the nerd things, you know, when people think the nerd movies are so popular. Yeah , but like that's different though.

Um video games are finally starting to be not even starting as far as I'm concerned. They're a thing now where it's not weird to like video games. Um it's a little more mainstream but still like I've recently been introduced to a whole group of people that think it's crazy that people actually play video games. And I was like I didn't know those people still exist. Those people in your life they're really weird people. Were they from 1987?

Like you look you don't look at them as an actual pastime and an art form. You just look at them as something people do on a train.

People know that and that's like kind of like the tropiest of tropes of that. I think there's a different reason, but I think it goes back to comic book nerd . It's not so much also that it makes me look bad. I I think I found this because I'm still reading a couple DC. I'm waiting for them to reboot this nightmare that they created for themselves.

That's all you have to read.\" I mean, that's thing. There is a core. But then the problem is, especially these days, they reference things that happen. And sometimes in Spiderverse, this recently happened where you can't just read the Spiderverse books. Like there's big events like people die in in the other issues and it's like they just don't even reference it later until randomly it's like oh yeah where's this guy? Oh he's dead.

What I'm always pushing and these are the DC people. always pushing them on. Just don't do the New 52. Just blow up continuity. Just take Jeff Johns and Jim Lee and say, \"All right, guys. Great. You have 12 issues of Superman. Do whatever the **** you want, and when it ends, the next person gets to do whatever the **** they want.\" And it that's why I love Injustice so much. At least the first year, two years of Injustice. Right now, it's so hard to keep up with cuz it's been going for so long. But Injustice was like, \"All right, cool.

And like and my my uh sort of point of reference for this is not I don't read Marvel. I don't read DC comics. I just don't. Uh I got back into comics when you guys were started talking about Invincible via The Walking Dead, which I still haven't gone back and read The Walking Dead comics, but I got I was like, I'll check out Invincible. And I'm hooked .

I don't ever recommend, oh, you need to read Superman 35 to 42 because they No, I'm like, read Last Sun, which, you know, happened in action.

Yeah. It's, you know, I I understand that there's the certain economics of the of the comic book industry where they want to kind of get that big fanboy, but when you become that reliant upon like your fanboys and like the people you currently have, your your community, you really do that at the expense of of broadening things.

How much longer comics have been around than video games, but how I feel like every day we see the video game industry mature with us. That's what I always talk about, right?

But I feel like when if I'm on an airplane and I'm reading a comic on my iPad, I'm going to get weirder looks than if I was playing a 3DS or a Vita or whatever. Especially when like nudie bits pop up. Oh yeah boy. I'm like I I didn't know it was there. This last one I'm reading Saga and I was like oh Saga's got to love I was reading Powers and Powers there's no nudity in it until like like the 16th uh book and I'm like oh oh okay well that's disgusting.

But I think well first we got to make the distinction right and this is unfortunately the distinction you have to make between a comic book and a graphic novel which for some reason the graphic novel just seems so much more mature. It does. Right. No. uh they're telling more mature stories and it's not about the you know it's not about the fantasy of the superhero. It's about telling a story you can't easily tell in other mediums. Um I also stand by the fact that it's it's a price point problem why they're not mainstream. Sure9 is still ridiculous damn expensive for what you get. Like it wards me off every time I want to go get a comic book.

I mean, you get a **** 99 or freetoplay game on your phone and you have seven hours of entertainment. Once again, this is one of the things that Image does so well is I don't believe I've seen this out of DC is they'll sell like the TPB volumes. So like 1 through 14, you know, so you're coming in at like $15. I can get like seven, eight of them in continuity and I can now make an informed decision.

And that's one of the reasons DC went back and reset everything to try to get you in, but it didn't work to, I'm sure, the level they want. Now they're back to like I definitely think that it it did.

That was Marvel's way of getting a new reboot. That was Marvel's way of just doing something new. It was not part of the actual continuity. It was a new jumping off point. And they started with Spider-Man back in 2001 because of the Spider-Man movies coming out then. It was like, \"All right, we're going to get this new group of people in.\" And it's supposed to be able to just get in there.

So, imagine and Greg's really into Superman, you know, like I've never met anyone who loves a superhero as much as Greg loves Superman and he doesn't even know everything about him. So can you imagine pre can you imagine the holes in normal people's lot and knowledge about some of these comics they should just treat it with a little more care and respect I think and that's why I still think that like with the comic book movie craze is indicative that the comic the whole thing is going to crash like it might not happen in a year or two but it's going to",

You know what I mean? I sent it to you today. We didn't It didn't make the show. Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I forgot about that. No big deal. I thought this was fascinating and we'll end it here. This has nothing to do with comics, but it's a similar thing of what's happening. Maxis just closed down, right? Emery, all the Sim City guys.

And if when DC and Marvel do inevitably have trouble and have to hemorrhage out big artists that can't get paid when this isn't going to happen, but let's say Jeff Johns left, he's like CO COO now or whatever. When he leaves DLC or DC, he'd be able to do something like that and be get the books and do different things and have it however he wants it or just go to Image.

Well with Convergence whatever I'm getting to finally look back at the universe I used to like and see what happened. What is going on with Superman in this suck man and you're explaining why comics don't do well. No, I know I trust me I know the the answer. It's just something I thought was a good topic . So ironic with the rise of Comic-Con and and and the movies and stuff like that. Like it's incredible the they are not congruent with each other at all.

Yeah, you you and and I I just want to say real quick like I I I've always looked for reasons to get into comics and it's one of those things that I just it's just never happened for years. You should really try the latest Batman run cuz I think yeah from start to finish where it's at. It's not done yet but like from start to where it's at now it's excellent and it's awesome and everything else and like you don't need to read any of the other **** ones like yeah in the family.

But what is how do they explain how a normal human can fight against Superman and have any chance? He's really kryptonite. If he doesn't have kryptonite, he can say that he put a bomb on an innocent person and that if he if you break through this thing, he'll die. You know what?

Yeah, that's platinum that game. Yeah, me too. I was like, \"So, exactly how does it work?\" Since he can like conjure anything he wants and well, you have 32 constructs. It's like, you know, he really it's like does not work. Not only in the comics, it's like, well, he if he's that powerful, why do we have problems? Yeah, exactly.
