You are a key member of the Kinda Funny team. I a crack Maria. I'm like the sniper on the SWAT team. You're like the guy that goes to the door like bust to the door. Colin's like the guy that plans everything goes yeah, mhm. Yeah, he's got like the blueprint in the cup of coffee on the the hood of the SWAT car. Tim's the guy that comes in like a little like hung over. Tim's the guy who blows it. He's the one who runs get shot immediately. Uh but we're running you through some video games that are important to us and showing you what they mean. Of course, Colin gave you a taste of Castlevania Symphony the Night.

I thought I'd go a different direction and start with something a little more current that we talk about all the time on Kinda Funny, Persona 4 Golden. Of course, this seminal PlayStation VA game. Now the one knock of course that Persona 4 Golden gets a lot is that it takes a while to get going. You start the game, right and you it takes a little bit of you know what's going to happen, where's it going go? I've jumped you about 70 hours into the game right now . 70, 70, 70, 70. But I believe the save on this one was 72 to be exact. So we've jumped in, we're running around our what did you do for the other 72 hours of this game? I romance CH. This is my girlfriend CH over here. She just chills there in her booths. Yeah, seems like an inappropriate outfit for the winter time. It's clearly winter time.

See we're running around greeting everybody. I'm if you've never played Persona, there's a chance we'll run into spoilers I guess. I don't I mean 70 hours in I don't think so. But the big part of Persona right is managing all these relationships right and then going into the TV world to do battle with evil things. Okay, so I'm going to see if we can do it on New Year's year. No, no, my greetings all take priority. So I'm going to run around see this is the whole thing is that we got to run around and talk to everybody right? All these people that have mattered to us forever right?

Okay, all right. I don't know how how how clear how it's clear as day that he's not really a bear right there. Okay, he's just the man dressing up like a bear. It's Japan after all. There's a long story here that we don't need to go through right now. Is that your girlfriend cuz she's cute? No, I that's Yuk iko and I didn't take her. I I took CH. This is re why you take CH? CH is amazing. Re is cute too. I know they're all cute. That's the it's a it's a jrpg. How cute is she? Let's go talk to her . I want to see what she look like.

Well, I don't think you'd have the same success as Senpai here. Well, it's cuz his pants are really high and tight. I don't know if that's why he's having such a good is that him? No, that's that's no I am Senpai. You're Senpai. Yeah, thead be confused with kohai which is from Rising Sun start Wesley S con great film skipping through everything. I don't want to spoil anything for you but I'm you know we're I'm giving you a tour of Inaba here. Okay, this is the big point. You know what I mean? I don't know if you understand.

Yeah, well the whole it's a it's a story driven game right? Like I I got to talk to a fox here. Clearly there's a lot going on. So basically this game is just a metaphor for hardcore drug use. No, what you talking about? Look how happy the foxes to see is. Yeah, that fox like if I saw that in real life I'd be like what did I just eat? I got to throw up immediately and ride this one out. Everyone great soundtrack though. Oh my God, but like see we're talking about it like in so you can come down here and like you have to build these Social Links with people.

Oh okay, so it's the one thing where I'm like God can we just get through this stupid thing the stupid uh I think when you see how cute everybody is here and how how great the story is it'd be a different story. Well, I mean it's it looks cool. It looks like this is something you want to kind of get out there and explore especially since this is a Vita game right? Yeah, exactly. It's with you all the time so you're kind of just kind of hanging on on the train you're like well I'll see what's happening not in the real world which is clearly not as fun as this world.
