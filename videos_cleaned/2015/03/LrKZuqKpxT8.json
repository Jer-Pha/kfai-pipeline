      "text": "Greetings and salutations , welcome back to Kinda Funny Games. My name is K Moriarty, this is Nick Scarpino, and we're going to continue the education of Nick Scarpino with a game that I hold near and dear to my heart. It's one of my favorite games of all time, Nick. It's called ActRaiser. It's a Super Nintendo game, um, and it's by a developer called Quintet, which doesn't exist anymore. Quintet's kind of like, I don't know, they have it. It says Enix. Quintet is in Square Enix. Yeah, well Enix used to be Square's competitor and they were a publisher and they also developed games. Um, they combined later on, but at this time it was just Enix and Quintet, like they developed like Illusion of Gaia, Robo Trek, uh, Soul Blazer, like a bunch of games on Super Nintendo. They, they don't exist anymore. They went, they're defunct now. Um, but this is their best game I think, um, and one of my, again, one of my very favorite games of all the time and I'll contend, Nick, that this particular game is one of the most unique games ever.",

Well, right off the bat , column, what we're seeing here, uh, gets me excited because it is a cherub, a small angel like creature. It probably is actually an angel, not a cherub because it does have a halo on it, but you know, I like Pit. I do. I, I'm aware of that . So if this game's about Pit, which I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that it is, it's just basically a Pit game, then I'm super excited, but I don't think so because it says Filmore, the angel Filmore. Of course, uh, one of the most notoriously steep streets in San Francisco has stairs built into it when you walk up it. So Filmore is actually going to be the first place we go. Now what's unique about this game is that you, let's just, yeah, let's just go in and and uh, take care of it. What kind of game is this? Well, I'm going to show you. So the game is",

Well, I'm going to show you. So the game is half side-scrolling action game, half city building simulator. Okay, there's nothing like it. And the game, so you go to different territories. Filmore is the first place we go and you're going to see it up here and we go in and we fight the monsters. This was, this was Super Nintendo. This is Super Nintendo, very early Super Nintendo game. So this looks like Pilot Wings right there. Okay, we just fell to the Earth and so what we're going to do first is we're going to go through this section of the game to unlock it from its monsters and then we are going to build the territory as if it's Sim City. Now do our angel just go into this like suit of armor? I'm actually, I, as far as I understand, I think I'm God actually at this game. Oh, you're God. Yeah, so, so it's similar to real life. Exactly.

And one of the things, there not many people talk about this game. I think a lot of people really know about it. No, I've never heard of it before. But one of the, one of the people that loves this game too was someone we used to work with at IGN, Mitch Dyer, and he was one of the only other people I've ever met that's like has like a, doesn't like ActRaiser, but has a passion for ActRaiser. Really? Yeah, because they made a sequel.

So like the game is just brilliant. It looks crazy right now. It's this is some crazy Tolkien stuff, you know, like there's like a, that's like an imp right there. Is that what they were called? And an, yeah, an. Yeah, so we, we're going to fight the boss here. Okay. Oh, he's a regal looking fellow, isn't he? What's going on with that spear? He has a reg, where's that spear coming from? Jesus , this guy's got a lot of powers. The the face of a hawk, the body of a man, the legs of a, a Clydesdale. Look at this guy. He's got a lot going on in that suit of armor.

He does have great and I know how you love thighs. I love thighs. Um, I'm a huge thigh fan. I almost died there, which would have been embarrassing because this is not even a hard stage. So the Filmore is now clear of enemies for now. Okay, we'll go back in again and fight in a little while, but in the meantime, we're going to go back to our God kind of headquarters, the place in the clouds. I don't really know what exactly what it is and Heaven. Some people call it Heaven, Heaven, but I don't, I don't want to call Heaven because I feel like it's really more of a command center. Okay, so now the game totally changes control. Got it. Heaven gives Filmore right there. This is Filmore and Heaven gives us our first man and our first woman.

Please raid the land of these monsters with my arrows. So now we're controlling the angel as a proxy, okay? And the game had the game is surprisingly deep for when it came out, especially I think on console because we're going to have to start building houses and roads, get rid of some instructions all the while dealing with monsters that spawn everywhere and we have to send our guys to seal various monster layers because there's some remnants of the monsters then we go and we fight one more time and we do this all over the world.

U my master, we are having a difficult time building homes because of many bushes. Please burn the bushes and guess as we begin to build our road. So they're, they're asking me for help. Okay, so what we're going to do is, uh, we're going to build his little butt. Yeah, so like here I can, I can come here and fight these enemies with my, you know, as the angel as, okay? And these guys aren't really going to be able to do much, like much yet. These bat creatures can steal your, your people when you start habitating land or, okay?

Okay, so, so I'm going to use this and I'm going to, sir, which direction do you wish the city to develop? And I like the city to develop in this direction. So I'm going to, so they're going to start building in this direction. Now people are going to come out of the house, the road is going to be built, okay? And they're going to come and they're going to come, you know, they're going to come in this direction.

Um, pretty thick, but a lot of a lot of instruction man would think back then. See, so we have six territories and we haven't been to Bloodpool or Cindor or anything like that yet, but we will go there and it will show you like how you're doing. So you can actually jump around from place to place if you want and you can see this your own status. So I have three lives and some, you know, experience points and stuff like that. Um, so let's see if I can get out of here. Let's see, move Sky Palace, move observe the people. So now we're back down here with my little angel friend .

So they built a house in a little field. This field will feed my people and now my my population will grow. So now I have six people. Oh , that's cool. What's with the bat symbol? So this is, so if I eventually I'm going to eventually encourage them to go this way, mhm. And then when they build here, I can actually, I can draw them all the way here. So I'll show you if I can, I can make it happen. Okay. And then once you hit that, can you take over that symbol? Exactly. They'll seal it and it'll go away and you'll get some some cool powers.

So my houses are going up. I have 22 people in my town now. Um, and so they want to talk to me again. So they're praying to me. Our master, we finally master the hunt skill of hunting animals. We now have enough confidence to fight monsters. Please lead us to the monster layer. So this is exactly answering your question, BAS. Okay, cool. So if we encourage them to build in this direction again, they'll go and steal the monster there. Wow, you got a lot of dudes now. They procreate very fast. Yeah. Oh yeah . Time's going. I have a little horse too. See? Oh, look at the horse, Tim. Look at the horse. Hey, you know, he looks like one of those uh uh what are what are the dogs the queen has? Corgi.

Is it like a powerful item, some sort of power ? I don't know what it is. Let's see now was the goal to then start building the building out to that other Monster's Nest? Don't have any. Yeah, exactly. You want to eventually seal all the layers, okay? And this is just in Filmore and this is just here. So we still got to go to Adidas, marijuana and North North Face, right? Exact exactly those those towns that for some reason oh see this guy was trying to steal my people and this guy this guy burned my house down.

Now one of the cool things about this game and I didn't realize this until I was an adult mhm is that you can actually max out your your population in very specific ways, but you have to like destroy all your buildings and then build them again because they learn new building techniques. Okay, so let's see what they're going to say. What you destroy with like a like a fire? Yeah, I can destroy with earthquakes. Oh wow. My master recently strange things have been happening to me. Many of my thoughts actually come to life in the real world. Oh, these powers real. I feel the presence of something hly radiating from the woods east of you.
