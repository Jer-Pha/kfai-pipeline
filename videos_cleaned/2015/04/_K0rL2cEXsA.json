Well, they started this whole, you know, lottery thing. It's like, what are you doing? You know, for 10 years I never had a problem getting a ticket until they made sure scalpers couldn't get a tickets and then the people who really want them can't get them. And then you're like, what are you turning this into a social game? It's like Zynga was designing the the ticket policy. You know, like what are you talking about? Keep coming back and it'll be available for sale in 3 hours on one day. Like what the **** are you doing? You know, it's really upsetting, which is, you know, but you go out there and you die anyway. I mean, so harsh. There's a fascinating, they did a documentary about that and like they they have all there's that original crew that that plans it every year and they talk about how it it's it's sad because it's one of those things that's",

I mean, they'll even say they like it's disappointing this goes a little bit against what this thing is, but if we don't do this, if we don't charge prices, we like ticket prices, we can't have ambulances, we can't have ER people. We can't lose the social game of uh lottery **** that they injected in, which is like who designed? I swear it's like the worst social gaming company they hired to figure out how to sell the tickets and and now you're talking about an event like Burning Man, right? We're not talking Coachella where you go down there and you know you're going to go to a concert for a couple days and stay in your little tent on grass, right? No, we're talking about you go",

They're like, **** this, we moved out a long time ago, moved to Seattle a long time ago. It's literally that bad, you know. I've seen 121 degree days out there, right? Like **** is crazy out there at times. And so you need if you're going to do it right, you need to plan a whole year in advance. Except the way that they do is they go, well, you know, as you missed the February Lotto for this, but you didn't get picked, but you know, coming up again in May and you're like the events in August. Yeah, I got a plan for this thing. It's like summoning K May. I'll so I just stopped going, you know, and I think a number of people do that, but a lot of more people are showing up.

But the other thing that was interesting is is that when I started going there, I remember the first year I went, it was with great people. There was one bar that I remember where people were serving alcohol, everyone else is high on something else, right? There's one bar. Now it's all bars, which means a lot more alcohol, a lot more people. And and I can guarantee you this, no one ever got smarter on alcohol, right? Yeah, I'll tell you what they did get is dehydrated, which is which is and because they probably didn't bring water either. Um, no, it's a fascina if if you get a chance, there's a great documentary on Netflix about it and not it's not a great do Bernie Man or just this like the tick ification. It's the beginning of Bernie Man all the way up until I think Bernie Man 2012 when they start how long Bernie Man been going? 94 something first one on the beach",

They did the beach out out in um 93 that beach, right? Right. Yeah, North San Francisco out. I can't remember where we're at se um yeah, Seaside. Um it's it's fascinating cuz they they start with a complete and total blank canvas and their their the methodology behind it is it's like they don't leave anything behind, right? So like they they have groups of of at the very end of the event, they have groups of volunteers that will walk like you're looking for someone in the forest and they will make sure there's no Nails, no screws, cigarette butts, anything left behind. They do they go down and pick it up. It's really fascinating. But then the other fasc is they show how they have to um store all the **** cuz like half of the infrastructure they have to have infrastructure because it's so big you have to",

It's all stored offsite like miles away and so they start loading in that show like like a month in advance or something. It's crazy, man. It's an industry, but it's it's still I think from what I've heard a lot of people say it's still worth going to. It's still worth experiencing. You don't die without going to Burning Man. I mean like don't hit your grave without seeing that first like no matter what it sounds absolutely horrible. It's absolutely insane. How many years did you go? About 12. Okay, you know, it's uh but the first year it changed it totally changed my life. Really? That's what people that's what everybody say. It renewed my faith in humanity.

We're going to drag 50,000 people out into the harshest one of the top 10 legitimately one of the top 10 harshest environments on planet Earth, right? Like I said, ants don't live there. Insects are like **** this place, right? Insects think think about that, right? So people absolutely live through the Apocalypse in and they W go to no they don't go to bur like what are you crazy think you for doing the Beetles. Yeah, but when you got there, I mean the first year I went was with the uh you know, Josh Gabriel, the DJ I grew up with uh Bas uh uh Gabriel and Dresden, you know, stuff like that.

And they're like, you got to go to Burning Man. It's so intense that you get a different sound, you get different things happening because the environment is just so harsh. You're all in it together, right? And then what you're looking at like, you know, I mean the trust funders, the trust afarian, you know, they're coming in from all over the world, right? Japan, China, wherever the people are coming there because there is no party like it on earth, right?

I mean, there's Thunderdome, the the the club, the East Bay Rats, the fight club, they have the do thund and the guys, you know, sometimes you'll see people ultimate fighting and you're like it's **** Bernie Man, you're ultimate you're bashing each other's faces, but hey, you know, that's what they want to do and uh let's go what the **** yeah, this is a real thing. This is something that people do. Let's go get Super Stone and fight each other at the end of it.

So this is like industrial accidents at the entertainment meaning this is like industrial accidents for entertainment, right? It's unbelievable and we were out there one time and they did we didn't know it was going on, but they said ah guess you know, I mean it's so big and so many things going on you don't possibly you can't see everything it's impossible. There's like districts and stuff, right? Like I've heard it's a million things happening at once.
