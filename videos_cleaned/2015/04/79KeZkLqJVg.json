So they're a thing, they're definitely a thing, and they're a real big thing, and I don't think people expected them to be as big of a thing as they are. We got grown ass men and women out there fighting the good fight trying to get their next Amiibos. There's so much going on on Twitter, it's turning people into animals. It's a new Beanie Baby . Yeah, they are. And it's it's crazy because like, all right, this Disney Infinity didn't do that, Skylanders didn't do that. Well, that's cuz they understand supply and demand . Yeah, well then also they just they were different. They were very Activision about it, which is just like, let's just **** make money, buy this ****, you know, little kids, you want this, go for it. This is like, hey, here's characters you actually really care and I guess Disney Infinity has this too, but like this is different because this targeted the heart of Andrew Goldfarb and I was like, you need this, you **** need this.

And now that so Smash Bros, what's shocking to me is we're like four characters away I think from all 50 characters having their own Amiibo in stores. Oh, really? Yeah, well at least announced, sure, sure, sure. So like they've given dates for all of them except for like four of them. I think Falco and like Falcon, I know Falcon doesn't have his, but it's like I never ever in my life would have thought that I'm going to get a Star Fox figurine in stores. Yeah, that makes no sense. An Ike from Fire Emblem, what? Yeah, like there's all these like crazy things. And so there's Smash Bros and now there's the there was the Mario line and then there now there's Yoshi's Woolly World, which amazing little yarn ones, I'm definitely getting one of those . I'm",

I don't understand why people are acting like these are the worst things in the world cuz you get one, you get a whole bunch of them. Yeah, you got what's the problem with that? That's on a lot of them. That's on you. You're against them cuz if you get one, you got to get them all. No, against them. I just know that like there's a reason why I don't buy Pop figures because if I buy one, I'm like, oh, I'm going to go I'm going get all the characters in that like imagine if those Pop figures gave you costumes successfully made them a collectible, which I didn't think they were going to do.

I didn't think the quality of the Amiibo stacked up against Disney Infinity figurines, um Skylanders figurines as well also really high quality. But where Nintendo has failed with Amiibo in my opinion is in game functionality. In a lot of the games the functionality is really really weak and they haven't made a game yet where you need to have an Amiibo to play that game the way that Infinity and Skylanders have. I think that's where they've really misstepped and maybe that's why they kind of held back in production of Amiibo which makes them hard to get is because they were kind of you know tepid about the audience response knowing full well that you don't need to have Smash Brothers Amiibo to play Smash Brothers, right? So I would like to see Nintendo actually step up their in-game functionality and then maybe I'll consider buying them cuz I've have not bought a single Amiibo yet and I have a shelf full of",

Do you really? I do. Do you play Infinity? I do not all the time. I need to play more, but it's um it's a hard game. It's most fun when you're playing in Toy Box with friends and the only friend I have that plays in Toy Box regularly is Brandon Jones. So see that my thing with I agree completely with what you're saying, but I just I don't think that Infinity or Skylanders are the right answer. Like it's not like if Nintendo made that that it'd be like, all right, now it's worth buying these things. Like I don't know that we need a game based on that cuz that might be a problem cuz then you have to buy all these things to make this game fun and like that's an issue.

I mean that's the functionality that Skylanders Infinity has, right? And that's what makes it so addictive is that idea that you just put the character down onto the Infinity Baye or the Skylanders power portal and like your character instantly appears in the game . It's like that technology at work in front of your eyes is really magical, you know, you know when you use it and Amiibo just doesn't have that.

Yeah, I I remember I did a demo of Infinity and I was just like I I love these little figures. I love Disney way more than I should and I want these things, but it's like I don't want to play this game. I really don't. Well, I would say Infinity's gameplay strengths are in the Toy Box whereas Skylanders gameplay strengths are in their actual like campaign. I think that they just did a much better job of making that gameplay accessible and exciting to people that are above the age of like 10. Um and I think we'll see in in the Infinity team take it even further with the next Infinity that they're going to announce which hopefully will be happening sometime soon.

Yeah, I mean my problem with I my I mean problem in quotes because I don't really care about the Amiibos, right? I'm a Sega kid. I wish I had I wish I made different only wish there was Comic Zone Amiibos, man. I wish I made different choices and the characters meant more to me than they do. They don't. I respect everybody and don't get me wrong, but like you know when the Mega Man came out, made sure I pre-ordered it for Colin for Christmas. Like that was his Christmas gift and even that got here in March, you know what I mean? And that was not not just because they couldn't fulfill the order or whatever. The problem I have with them is this crazy like just make more of them. Why? It's 2015. Why are we acting like",

You go to Amazon, you click buy, you get it. But Nintendo doesn't get along with Amazon so everything's all **** up. I don't like that. Just fix it so everybody can get what they want. I don't understand why this is such a big deal. I don't understand and clearly I don't understand why it's such a big deal because Nintendo does understand why this is a big deal to make it a bigger deal . They they have played their fan base like a fiddle and good on them.

They hear you. They know what they're doing. They're doing this so you tweet about them so you keep talking. Like I don't even know how many waves of Disney Infinity Figures have come out since the Avengers and you know Guardians of the Galaxy and stuff cuz those are guys I would care about . Have there been more? I don't know. Maybe there have, but the people aren't tweeting about him every day. You have people tweeting about this every day. You have Jose Otero with a cart full of **** Yoshis taking photos of him. It's just like what the **** is going on ? Like what the **** is happening right now? You know what I mean?

No, I I again if they were just out nobody would be talking about. No one would give a **** if you could just find Ike in any store you walk into. No one would care, but the fact that you can't get Ike makes you want Ike. Like the thing is when they first came out I was like I don't need these. I'm not going to use them for the actual game functionality. I kind of want them cuz I like buying things a l and I was just like which which characters would I buy? I was like all right I'll definitely get the characters I play as so I'll get Zero Suit, I'll get Charizard. Oh those aren't out yet. I use Mar, I'll get Mar and of course Mar's like one of the rarest ones you can't get. I'm like well this just went from I",

And now once I started thinking about that number I'm like I don't need this but one day I'll it's one of those things where it's it's Comic Con every **** month whereas like Comic Con you don't get in line for the Hasbro you don't get the crazy He-Man thing you **** about it on Twitter for one day and I never hear about it again and like every **** 3 weeks I'm hearing about Amiibos. I just don't understand the little faucet they're letting trick a lot of characters but again it's just cuz I I just I'm immune I am deaf to their Pi Piper and so I just get to watch all these people freaking out about it you know what I mean?

Yeah I mean I'm yeah I respect Nintendo but they're you know it doesn't really resonate with me but God forbid if they make Pokemon ones oh I know I would go bankrupt. That's the problem like Nintendo's going to that's their game when they make the Pokemon game with the Amiibos oh God help us all if they make they made a true like full RPG Pokemon that had required functionality then that would be really huge because look at how much Skylanders has made for Activision. It's a over $2 billion dollar franchise now since that since that franchise launched you know Nintendo could make that kind of money if they did it right but Nintendo just always missteps just a little bit right just a little so like they're doing the they're on the right path but I don't think that they're making all of the right decisions yet and I",

Yeah I don't think they're going to I think the smart thing if they were to do a Pokemon game would be just you can play the Pokemon game right and you can catch a Pokemons yeah okay yeah and then the ones the ones that you can't find you can just go buy in the store and then use that like like integration right but because then at that point it's like oh like I have the Blue version like I can't you know I what you're saying the exclusive ones you can't get I could buy all the red version ones or you're adding in-game transactions that are in stores an in St transaction to a game",

Yeah I mean that's the real killer when like if they want this I guess they again they don't need to they're fine everything's working I'm sure the way they want they rolling in money from this but when they're like all right now we're putting out 8bit Mario Amiibo and when you touch it to your Wii U you you automatically download the original Super Mario Brothers something like that it's **** awesome and not really doing that it's like kind of that it's like you get to play for 15 seconds and it's like well **** you but like that's what I'd want from the Smash Bros ones like if the new DLC characters so when Mewtwo comes out and Lucas and whoever the hell else comes out like if instead of me paying for the DLC to buy",

So Mewtwo is what $3.99 if you buy the digital download if you were to buy the Mewtwo Amiibo for what $12.99 they are right? $14.99 I only see him on eBay for 55. I don't know. So if you buy the Amiibo and then he automatically unlocked when you tapped into the gamepad that would be genius , right? But they're not doing that. Yeah, missed opportunity. That'd be so awesome. Another thing that bothers me and this is just a very me thing but the yarn Yoshi yeah it's like it doesn't have there's no base like where's the consistency guys? You can't do that.
