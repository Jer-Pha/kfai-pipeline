Coat coats asks Nick Scarpino, which is, if you have topics for me, please at me, is digital entertainment, movies, TV, games, etc., a literal waste of your time? What's a good balance of work and play? Do you guys feel that sometimes when you're playing, you're on your eighth hour of a game, you're like, \"****, this is eight hours I could have been spending doing anything else?\" Does that ever creep into the back? That's why I don't watch movies or play games or listen to music. I just read a lot of Wikipedia. You do? Yeah, now I'm like, I'm informed. I, uh, you are, you're channeling Colin. I don't know what's happening. No, I do. I do read a lot of Wikipedia. I thought I thought it was just really there's a lot of experiences I'm like, I don't need that. I don't need to put 10 hours into this. There's a lot of comic books that I'm never going to read because",

Well, I think I think this comes down to to two competing forces here, right? This is you not to eat the Nature Box food, two competing forces. Number one is that sort of um there is something in like in like a fandom community or like in a geek community that I think we're all a part of that is like the guilt of not not being informed, the guilt of not knowing, of not being up on everything and you want to be able to like play the games, watch the movies, read the comics, do everything that everybody else is doing and you want to be a part of it, right? Because you love this stuff and it's just like, oh, I want to be up on it all, you know? And then there is the uh there's the whole like there is this real adult guilt",

Like you're talking about like, okay, I'm having a fairly good time with this game. Uh, I have so many other things that I could be doing, you know, like I need to watch and this isn't a joke, I'm not leading into a joke. I need to watch Fast 6 this weekend before I go see Fast 7 on Sunday. I don't care what the titles are. Stop shaking your head. No, I'm just upset that like whatever you're saying, just keep going. Hey, can you do me a favor and try not to fall asleep this time? Well, I was drunk that time, so like give me some credit there. I remember bits and pieces of him like drunk on speed what happened here ly and he's like doing the detective Vision thing that's all I really remember anyways, but it's like I want",

I also want to I you know, I'm caught up on Flash and Arrow now, so I feel good about that. But it's like, yeah, like where do I you know, ET out those two hours where I'm not ignoring Christine or ignoring a game I'd rather be playing or doing this to. Yeah, and I think the answer is it's just more like it's more about editing and not having that like fear of missing out on the thing, you know what I mean? The problem is like it's so much more pronounced now with Twitter, right? You or like Facebook, whatever the digital stratosphere in the way that you have now, we'll say 100 friends, right? And where in the the old days you hang out with your five friends, you'd all have a shared interest, you'd all go watch a movie, you'd all watch the show",

Now you have a hundred friends all with splined interests all wanting to ask you if you that as soon as Arrow ended on the East Coast before it's even aired out here what did I think of it? Like you're like, I'm not there yet. Stop stop not just that, but there are certain there are certain things where you can feel when the spoiler threshold is about to break. Yeah, you know, and every and every TV show, every community, every movie has like a different set of rules. Like if you're not watching Mad Men when Mad Men is on, you're getting spoiled. St everybody's live Game of Thrones. The Game of Thrones community has no etiquette about spoilers, right? Well, that's there was one specific that specific episode with the Red",

Well, for me it was everyone's talking about it Tom. I think it was the Red Wedding. I forget what is usually I watch it the next day with Christine or whatever and it was I was on Twitter and everyone's reaction was like holy **** hashtag game like all that nobody spoiled it but I literally turned off Twitter. I'm like, we got to watch Game of Thrones right now. I don't know what the hell's happening but I need to know and so that becomes part of it too where it's just like but if I don't do it now is it going to be ruined for me?

Well, except for maybe Ultimate Spider-Man for some reason because you're definitely not watching that hash best Spider-Man series everh but it is a lot and the other thing that's like making it harder and harder is uh just how available everything is now where it's like and the volume and the yeah, so everybody's like, oh man, are you keeping up with the Americans? Watch the Americans. It's like, okay, I'll add the Americans. It's like, oh, by the way, you need to be watching this. Oh, okay , I'll watch that Keeping Up with the Kardashians.
