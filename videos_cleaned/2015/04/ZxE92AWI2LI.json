Uh, so I went to Iceland the other day and I've been overseas, I guess this is like my fourth time overseas, my third time, no, no, fifth time, my fifth time overseas. Um, and I offended you at yourself. I had no, no, I had my first, and I'm not Canada and all that. I had my first bout of real anti-Americanism in Iceland, like real to my face anti-American ism. I was, I wanted to share the story with you guys and and kind of talk about why it is that we are much maligned. Um, Obama, yeah. Um, so here's the story. First of all, I want to preface it by saying that people in Iceland for the most part, like with the exception of a few people, were awesome, like really nice people. A lot of them were very self uh deprecating, like why are you even here kind of thing? Like why would you ever come to this place? You know, like um, we want to go to us. I don't understand why you want to come here. Very nice people, very helpful people. Um, English is fluently spoken there. Um, it's mandatory to to",

Um, it's mandatory to to learn it. Um, there's only 320 ,000 people in the entire country, which is unbelievable. That's uh half the population of San Francisco. Um, and uh it's about a state the size of Kentucky. So you can you imagine like when you're in Reykvik, it's it's a it's a thriving city, about half the population lives there and then the rest of the country is just sparse, just very sparse. Yeah, beautiful place though, very desolate, very dark, um, very snowy. So I went to a bar, we were just like going from bar to bar, like just going from random places. We and we um, it's me and Cheryl and then two of our friends from um, really Cheryl's friends from our high school and then their boyfriends. Um, well actually one husband and one boyfriend.

Um, so three, four of us went to high school together and then another the a fifth guy is from Long Island and then uh six guys from Utah and we go into this bar and we're just drinking or whatever. These really, this is the weird dichotomy of the stories, these really nice older women are sitting around this table and we're kind of encroaching a little bit on their space, but they're slowly getting up and I sit down in someone's seat and I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ****. She's like, oh, don't worry about it, we're leaving. And she puts her hand on my, very warmly puts her hand on my arm and it's like, I, you know, like please sit, you know, and we're getting out of here. And I was like, oh, like really nice, what a nice old lady. And uh so they that that crew of ladies leaves and we sit down around this table and there's this older blonde woman, maybe in her 50s, very well-dressed, hot",

I a Golden Girls bar there, all the Little Women around drinking. It was just after work, I think one every just like kind of hanging out. And um, that was the one thing I noticed in Iceland is that because the city's so small and Reykvik, whatever, like there's just people of all ages in a lot of just same areas, like because that's where they hang out. Um, there's only so many bars, so many restaurants and ****. Um, and we sit down and we're just kind of coddling around and I go to the bathroom and then I come back and this blonde woman's talking to my group or whatever and she's asking them like who invited you to sit here? Like kind of like rudely or whatever. And she's like, you were not invited to sit here or whatever. And that's how we do it here. And I'm like, we were invited to here and we",

And we're like where and one of my friends is like, where do you think we're from? And she's like she like rolls around, she's like the United States or whatever like that. And uh and I'm like, yeah, where specifically do you think we're from? And she goes like this, she's like in the South, like as an insult. Oh yeah. And this is this is my first thing where I'm like, I'm so sick of the anti-South **** in this country. I really am. The South has a really **** up history, so does the entire country.

But she was saying that to us to insult us. Uh, oh, and then you know what happens to people that talk **** guys and the the funny thing is that my like the five of them are kind of just engaging with her and and trying to be nice and I'm being like really **** rude to her and what I realized was that like she was being the nicest to me because I was challenging her or whatever, but she would do things like she went and shook Cheryl's hand instead of her handshake like wasn't firm enough, whatever. And like like was she wasted or no? God damn, this is very intrusive. And then and then she was saying how she's like one of the last Viking families and like just a weird, weird totally weird ****.

Um, so uh it then gets to the point where she's talking about how she lived in Boston for a while or whatever and so on and then she's like making fun of like the way we're dressing and why we're here and like we don't belong, like basically don't belong there and like why would anyone come here and and like you're basically not invited, you're not welcome in Iceland kind of **** or whatever, like just straight up like anti-Americanism like like to my face. Like I've never experienced that before. I've been to Germany, I've been to England, I've been to Japan, like never had a problem really with anyone based on just who I am.

I'm like cuz it's really cheap to get here. And she like kind of just looked at me saying like, oh, it's a beautiful country. I'm like, it's just really cheap, we got here for like nothing. Yeah. And um, and she was like, and I was saying something to her like um, I'm like, you really should be nicer to tourist, your economy depends on us. And uh she's like, oh, that's not true, that's not true, you should learn your history. In my mind I'm like, what does that have to do with history ?

So maybe you should be like everyone else has been nice to us, why are you busting our balls or whatever? And then she was like making F like she said some something so weird where like she we were all wearing beanies and this was the weirdest comment. She was like she's like, no people would beat the **** out of you if they saw you wearing these beanies around here or whatever. And you notice that in Iceland a lot of people like pretend like it's not **** 10 degrees outside.

And this is the best part. I'm I'm leaving out parts cuz I don't want I don't want to belabor the story but my my favorite part of it was that she got up and she had blue jeans on and I'm like those blue jeans are American and and like I'm I keep confronting her and she keeps complimenting me.
