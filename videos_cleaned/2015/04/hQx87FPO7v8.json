You see, but you're indignant about it because they're not getting him for the right reason. What's happening? It's like YouTube people are getting him for the right reason. I just ****ed up as people know at there because I've talked about this before. If you wanted Mewtwo, you had to like register your your Wii U and your 3DS codes and you get him like a week early or whatever and then otherwise we have to buy him next week or in two weeks. Okay, I never thought that they would have given him early and like I forgot. I was like, oh, the last day to register is tomorrow and I was like, oh, that I would have to go home, get my two coffees, do all this. I was like, I don't want to do any of that. So I was like, I'll just buy it for $5 when it comes out. And then it comes out later. I'm like, oh, well, I made a bad mistake. I screwed up so I don't got Mewtwo. I don't really care about",

I didn't really use him in Melee at all, but I want new Smash for those characters give me excuse to play again, forces us to play again and I like that. Yeah, you can vote for what character you want, right? Is that what's going on? So they announced Mewtwo way back in the day, like before the game came out. Then recently they announced Lucas is going to be the next character coming in June, coming back from Brawl. And now there's this thing like, oh yeah, for the next characters we're going to let you vote for whatever character you want. And originally people were like, oh, just Nintendo characters. And then Nintendo was like, no, any game character, whoever the hell you want, vote for it. And the what's interesting to me is the voting is open until October. That's a long ass time. So they're they're",

Like why wouldn't they just, you know, put out something a little earlier than that? Because if Mewtwo is April, Lucas is July, I mean, I guess October is the next thing, but then that wouldn't make sense because making all these, I mean, it'll probably be like, it's not like it's that proba characters, sorry, there's probably other characters too. Yeah, that's true too. But yeah, so I mean, like it's not a public facing vote , right? Like you you cast your ballot and I never know and it just goes out yeah, out of there. They probably have the agreement locked up already. Exactly as far voted for Tails, here he is, here's Tails.

And oh my God, are people talking about it? Like it's one of the top NeoGaf threads every day is talking about what Smash Bros. character do you want? And like we get tweets all the time, what characters do you want? Who are you voting for? Help to get this character in and all this stuff. I'm like, holy crap, people are taking this really seriously, which is cool. People care about Smash Bros. I noticed um so my question to you guys is what characters do you want in, which characters do you not want in and who do you think will get in? I think you have a lot of insight into this. I wish that they would remove half the **** characters already in the game. Like but the the problem with this with the with the the roster as it is is",

Like but the the problem with this with the with the the roster as it is is there's just a lot of just these **** like it's like all these Fire Emblem characters. It's like who the **** are these people? Like I'm like like they're all the same. You know, I mean it's just like dude with cloak and sword. It's like, oh, that's fascinating. So there there's another thing that I I forgot to say uh there was another rumor that dropped a couple days ago since because the Mewtwo uh DLC is coming, there was a patch that was released for Smash Bros. people got in, kind of hacked all the info and found a bunch of **** hack the planet. Yeah, and like, you know, people do this all the time when games come out specifically for fighting games and games that kind of like that's how every PlayStation All-Stars game character came out. Remember that? Yeah, that was the best that type of **** it",

Yeah, that was the best that type of **** it was all in there. I was like, oh God and um you know, back in the day Brawl was hacked and people found that there was um or Melee was hacked originally and we saw that there was like day-to-day like files in there somewhere and then Brawl was hacked later and it was found that there was a Dixie Kong and um Mewtwo and one other character and then now that the happening here there was this rumor that uh Ryu from Street Fighter and Roy from Fire Emblem, Roy, let's get Roy back in there, distinguishable Fire Emblem character number seven who uh who he was in Melee would comeing back and then those rumors have essentially been like squashed and just they're total ****. Yeah, if Roy ever came comes back to a Smash Bros. game, I'm going to be shock. He was my main in Melee and I **** loved him but yeah if",

He was my main in Melee and I **** loved him but yeah if he came back that would make no sense cuz then there'd be three of the exact same character. It's too much man. There's and and I just I respect Fire Emblem. I think it's fine. I just don't understand like why the these it just seems a little uninspired. I feel like this roster for as big as it is is a little bit boring and I think that it would be cool for them to start really chasing some more third parties, but I also think that there there are first party characters that that could be in the game that aren't. I mean, I'm really still confused why Ice Climbers aren't in the game and I I would like you know Ice Climbers were my main and and I and I enjoyed playing as them and it's a little I know why like they couldn't make him work on 3DS and stuff like that.

It's like which is so funny 3DS is like so underpowered that I can't use the Ice Climbers. So I was like, all right, that's an interesting uh issue to to run but but the character that I've wanted for a long time that I've talked about is that I think Dr. Wily would have been a cool character and this is and this is before even Mega Man was in the new one um when I played uh Brawl and uh Pokemon Trainer was in it, I was like this would be an awesome way to do Dr. Wily um to keep him in the background and then he like summons Robot Masters to fight for him. I think would be really cool. Um so that's one of them and and I I I like the more like like when Snake was in it, it's like cool to have more serious character. I I wouldn't want a character like Ryu in there or whatever. I would like to keep it as cartoonish as possible unless it's in the",

Um Simon Belmont, yeah, Simon Belmont would be would be extraordinarily awesome or Alucard or Dracula or whoever. Um if you want to get like really nerdy get Cipha in there, another more obscure Castlevania character, but that would be pretty cool. Um and uh I mean when you when you explore like the first parties or the first party kind of content um they've done a nice job of exploring like getting the Villager and they even like Wii Sports trainer or whatever but I I I do Wonder like there's no no one from Star Tropics in there for instance or like like they can go deeper and and and deeper and I and I I would like for them to do that",

Um I don't know but the roster is already very big but I wish that they would give a thing like which characters don't you want and then they just take like five of them out. You're so funny. You're like the only person can't play you can't play anymore. No, I want I would I would love for them replace who do you want replaced? Like here's I was I was actually thinking about this the other day I've since it came to Wii U and 3DS I've not seen one single solitary **** person play as one character and if you can tell me who that character is I'll be I'll be impressed because I don't even think about him and it say and it says everything why is Wario in this game? No one playes him. No one. I have not seen any **** person with any of the people we've ever play no we don't yeah we just don't play as",

It's just I don't get him out of there get him out of there so funny the Fire Emblem thing is weird like I can't believe there's that many characters in it but it all comes down to Sakurai he's a big fan of Fire Emblem so he wanted to like support it and like stuff like in a lot of ways Smash Bros made Fire Emblem in America like I wonder if the franchise would have ever even come here if it wasn't for well it made a lot of curiosity I mean that's the Brilliance of of the marketing angle of Smash Brothers generally it's just you know people are exposed to this game don't know who these characters are if they're not as in into it as we are and then",

There's only one Fire Emblem character that didn't need to be there and that's Lucina because her and Marth are identical and she could have just been a costume all especially because they do costume Al in this game so that never made sense to me but besides that Lucina Ike Robin are different ass characters I'm not saying they're done they're not different I'm just saying that they are they all come from the same universe and they're just cloaked people with with uh you know that are boring I don't know I like them I think they're pretty cool it's",
