We're like, \"Guys, what do you want us to talk about?\" And then you let us know. Just like Arcade Lion did, and he asks, \"What game series need to end ?\" I look to you, Colin. God of War. Ratchet and Clank. Ratchet and Clank. Yes, it's time for Rat chet and Clank to go away. They've overstayed their welcome. Now they don't matter anymore. Thank you very much. Goodbye. I want them to come back and they are so You want them to come back . They never left, Tim. You can't miss something that never left. I I think but they're a perfect example of I want I wish that they they left a long time ago and then we're coming back now . But I don't want the series to end. They for all they for all intents and purposes they did leave. You know, after a crack in time, there was not a real Ratchet game. All the other ones were just like nobody cared. They kept coming.

They weren't even keeping up the facade when they played. Like, ah, things are coming. I I I I mean, what comes to my mind is Call of Duty, not because I don't like those games, but because I would love to see what they like the hype they could build and and the heights they could achieve if they just **** stopped. Yeah, exactly. It's not to say that like they're they're all, you know, Infinity Ward and Raven and all these guys are working on the games. It's not to say that like the same studios making these games. Sledgehammer's game will not be the new Call of Duty for three years, but what is the power of Call of Duty?

Um there are games like that that I wish that people would just or series like that where I'm like I wish they would just back off because you're kind like I defend Call of Duty all the time because I think they're fun. Um, but it's like you're doing damage to these franchises, even if you're making money on them, by just not leaving them alone. And look at what you could do. Look at how much money Rockstar made and how much profit they made by just not regurgitating Grand Theft Auto. They can make a Grand Theft Auto game every **** year. They pay anyone.

And then again, even more now with five. So, they were hungry. They were hungry. No one's hungry for **** Call of Duty. Like you might you might be anxious to play. You might want to play the new one, but no one's no one's hungry for Call of Duty because they won't make you hungry for it. See, what's interesting to me about this question is that, you know, we kind of take it as I think all of us instinctually take it as like what series do you want to end now so they can come back later. Yeah. But like what if we it was just to end no more in the future? Cuz like Yeah, I would love Pokemon to end now and then",

But what series do we just want to end? And now I feel like that's unfair to say to a bunch of **** cuz like it's I feel like then we can just throw a bunch of stuff out there that we're never going to play to make it a little more interesting. What's a game that we would have one more game of and then end it so they get at least one more chance to like wrap things up? Uncharted. You're going to Yeah, for all intents and purposes, it looks like Uncharted 4 is that or at least Nathan's story.

That would be depressing because I wouldn't want it to end uh looking like that. Even if the game even if the game is great, and I I don't know. I I I we talked about the the demo and I there were some positives and some negatives and I'm open-minded. I have no expectations. Um, I don't want it to end like that. Okay, what about 16 then ?

But I have to reserve my judgment in a way because like they could turn everything around with the whole arena thing, right? like they could have the dynamics that they had in the raid implemented into the arena and like who doesn't want I said this to Greg already but who doesn't like a horde mode style game type and I mean even for me it's harder to get people to be like to get six people together and be like hey you want to run this this raid this game in Destiny which like a lot of my friends are just don't care about Destiny anymore right it's the arena's three players it's easier to get people together, right?

So, like it's just that's not what's I'm going to gravitate towards unless there's something super unique about it. And I don't really feel like there is just on the outset. Um, you know, the reason I started playing a game like Vanqu ish, which is more of like a third-p person kind of shooter, is because it was **** cool and it looked and it looked interesting and I wanted to play it, but I can there's a I could play God of War or something like that if I wanted to play a game like that and I **** hate God of War.

Um, so it's really just not for me. That's why I didn't play them. So, I'm really excited for your answer to this one at 8bit ABS asks. Would you rather Shovel Knight 2, which is a NES style sequel that's slightly different than the core one, right? Or Super Shovel Knight, which is a 16- bit sequel? I'd rather them stay with the 8bit. But I think that I do think that their vision might be to do something more like Super Nintendo um and then evolve it from there. Uh no, I think that there's they going to get Shovel Knight 64 at some point, maybe. Um I think you're going to get a Shovel Knight sequel. I think that's obvious. uh what what they'll do with it",

They're a small team and I think that they worked really hard on kind of that engine and getting that pixel graphic look really right and nailed it and I I think they'd be really foolish to abandon it.

It's just their stupid Twitter to follow friends or whatever. There's a lot of pressure behind creating a username. I totally get that. I'm sorry.

You guys decided lukewarm indifferent. I didn't like the last Deus Ex. I tried to get into it and I was just like, \"No, this is not for me.\" It's one of those games that Scarpino was all about. Yeah, that's one of the A lot of people loved it. A lot of people loved it. But for me, I jumped in there and like the battery to do moves and stuff.

Never use Energizer. We're Duracell people here. But I did like the bunny. I'll always give the credit. Bunny was good commercial. Didn't get a shout out in the last video about commercials. Yeah, we should have. That game never stuck with me. Yeah. So, all right. I'll wait to see when it comes out.

I love that. You sound like Kevin right now. **** you, Tim. Zombies are super hot. Everybody loves shooting zombies. And the problem with the the reason Left 4 Dead works over Evolve is that it's so easy to wrap your head around. Yep. Everybody go shoot zombies with your friends. Got it. Evolve. Everybody go hunt your friend. By the way, each one of your character classes has some very specific things we need to learn. Please sit down. We have a video we have a video tutorial for you.
