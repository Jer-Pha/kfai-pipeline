      "text": "Greetings and salutations , welcome back to Kinda Funny games. My name is K Morard, this is Nick Scarpino, and we've been listening to you precious, oh so precious, Kinda Funny fans. You've been asking us to play Ori and the Blind Forest, an Xbox exclusive game. Um, and uh , so we're going to do just that, just that for you. Uh, Ori and the Blind Forest came out to Xbox One, uh, earlier this year. I think it's coming to PC or it might already be on PC at some, uh, some point this year. And I think it's coming to Xbox 360 actually later this year too, but right now for sure you can play it on Xbox One and that's where we are playing it. Um, thanks to our friends at Microsoft. Uh, so Nick, you and I, um, we saw this, we saw this at the Microsoft showcase that they did about two months ago. Yep. And, and they gave us three different saves at that point to get into like kind of the beginning area of the game, kind of the middle of the game, and then towards the end of the game to try out some new mechanics. We're going to",

We're going to start from the break, we're going to start from the beginning and just see what happens . It would be cool the show, I mean everyone's already seen that level, but I, I do like the level where the gravity starts to become sort of a puzzle element. So that's hopefully we can get to that stage at some point. I guess we can skip around, we can skip, well we have to get to that point, but we can, we have no save here, but I intend I'm playing this game all the way through. People that unfamiliar, Moon Studios made this game, uh, for Microsoft with the help of Microsoft Studios. Uh, this is I think their first game as a studio. Um, as far as I know, I've never heard of them before this game. Um, but I don't know everything, so maybe I'm wrong.

And so we're going to watch the intro here and just see what happens for the next 15, 20, 25 minutes. I don't know, we'll go as long as it, we'll stop when it doesn't feel right anymore. Nick, that's, I, there's only two times to stop, Col, when it doesn't feel right anymore or when someone's telling you to stop, right? That's it. Yeah, that's basically it. That's basically it. So I'm moving now myself here. That's you for now. It is. Look at his gut. It looks like my gut. Oh, he's beautiful. Look at this beautiful creature jumping, jump, the animations awesome.

And I mean look at the grass for Christ's sake. Yeah, I like when games take the time to have art in the foreground. It's beautiful. Oh yeah, that foreground element is amazing. I didn't notice that , but it gives it that cinematic, uh, uh, feel to it, right? Where we've got our, our force perspective in the Middle Ground, we got the backgrounds fed out and we got the far background which is you get that nice parallax scroll, but this takes it to the second level. So my, my big creature found this little creature, he's his friend and look how cute he is. He's just resting. Oh, he's awake. Oh no. Oh dear. Hello. Oh dear, I'm a little creature.

If I saw that guy be like, don't touch me, you psycho cuz he looks like a serial killer. Oh, we got you little, little apple for Naru . He exit out so they know that there's no more food there, I guess. Oh no, that sucks dude. Hey, hey brother, each tree only has one thing of fruit for you.

No, I can't either. Uh, it's just really, oh, there's something, there's something classic about it. There's some like, there's almost a, a, a beautiful, I don't want to say an anime style cuz it's not quite that, but it, it, it has that Mononoke. I was going to say it reminds me of Princess Mononoke, um, or you know, Howl's Moving Fortress, that, that kind of thing. It's, it's cool. So, but I mean something's going to happen there cuz right now these, these two are living just too good of a life. The life good, there's no, there's no conflict.

Oh no, well now the food is scarce. Oh no, this is sad. This is really sad. I didn't think this was going to be this **** depressing. Got real. This is like a Lord, this like the first 10 minutes of Up. Remember that? I never saw Up, but I know what happens in the beginning. Really sad. I played the game. Oh, there's one left.

Now did they do what the cavemen did to their, their lout, like where they just hunted all the mega to Extinction and all that kind of stuff? Is he, in other words, is he responsible for this somehow? Did they take too much fruit? Did this guy get too greedy, Nick? Well, I mean he was basically farming every tree to death as we saw the very, very first thing he does where he puts an X on it, I.E. this thing is dead, it cannot bear any more fruit. Oh, bummer. Wow, this is ****, this is one of the biggest depress, most depressing intros to a game I've ever seen in my life. I'm invested in it though. I like that it's got a heart.

Wow, the intro to this is quite, it's quite bold to have an intro this long. I would say typically time to play is really important, but when you tell a story this good and this riveting and something this sad that makes you want to see more, right? You could , you can get away with doing a 10, 15, 20 minute intro. Um, but the usual so-called time to fire and all that kind of stuff is pretty important in the game. We still have not played. I into it though. I mean mostly CU you're playing and I'm watching anyway, so I kind of had a backseat feel to this whole let's play to begin with. Oh, is he dead?

It's a nice touch, a lot of nice touches here, but see this is what got you into this trouble in the first place. Should have been more scarce. You don't need, you don't need to be that heavy. I really don't think that that's what happened. I don't think he single-handedly just destroyed the entire like de, the entire ecosystem himself. Okay. Oh no, is he dead? I hope not. Hey friend, I found some more for us. I mean these guys, I sympathize with the two of them, but let's be honest, you got to evolve or die. Like what the hell are they still doing there?

If you die, you just become a walking zombie. Look at him, he's moping around now. He's clearly questioning his own will to live. Is it you controlling this or is he doing it? Yeah, I'm controlling it. Get up, come on. What's his name? Nabo? I don't, I don't know who's who now anymore. I thought the big guy was Naru, maybe in this or was he? I don't know, it's not important. Geez, I mean this is just like bro, sit down and let the cold take you, you know what I mean? Just close your eyes and go. It's okay. He's trying to survive.

When we saw them played this game, they IM left out that you're going to want to, you're going to feel like you don't want to live yourself by the time you actually, yeah, you're going eat a **** bullet by the time like the intro scene. Jesus Christ, they aren't kidding around with this huh? They're not screwing around. Oh dear, is it living again of these flowers? Did he die too or something? I think he died. Yeah, his life force went into the ground into this tree. This is like very Studio Ghibli [Music] yes. Oh my God, I don't even know if I want to play this now.

Where is that over here? I think so. You got to get up there. Okay, there's, yeah, jump down. It's telling to go down here first I think cuz you can't get past those until you can attack. How's it control so far? It's awesome. It feels great. You're, I'm moving, I'm using the D-pad. You can use the left analog stick, but this is a game that's made for the D- pad I think and thankfully Xbox One mercifully Xbox One's controller has a good D-pad on it which was not the case with obviously the Xbox 360.

You can just save whenever you want as long as you have that energy which I think I just went right through that which I think is somewhat interesting. All right, don't mind if I do. I'll take some life Shard also. I'll take some Swiss chard. I like Swiss chard. You know my dad really likes Swiss chard as well. Big fan. Is this you can't, yeah, you can't get through that, but I'm, why is it like doesn't it look like it has a healthy glow to it ? I want to go back to that again.

Like you can't get through that. No, that's what you need to get right there, but I think you need the weapon. H let's continue to explore. Let's go back this way. It's got to be something that way. Is it under the water maybe? No, nope. Well you're dead. It's Dragon. You got to keep going this way. Is there more this way? Am I miss, oh yeah, there go.

Very cool. [Music] Oh my God. Yeah, so now you can just attack with which is cool cuz you're not actually aiming, you're just kind of hitting it and taking it out for you. I think the game, I think the game does a really cool job of, um, it is, it really does emphasize platforming over attacking which is even though you would do both. Um, you found a small Spirit Light container so I can level up now. Create a soul and can tap B to near it to access the ability tree.

We'll probably slow down, maybe stop playing, maybe we'll do another one in the future. You want to do another level? Should we keep playing? We keep playing for a while, see what happens. I don't know. Yeah, I mean uh how big do you think this level is? I don't know who the hell knows. Seems pretty vast. I'm already in a new place. Did you go to Berlin or Frankfurt? Uh Frankfurt I believe. Obviously this the game gets a hell of a lot harder. The game apparently gets very hard.

You should watch our uh you know you can watch any Let's Plays online, but I'm sure we'll do another one of one of the later levels where gravity starts playing into some of the puzzle solving aspects. Um, which would be cool. It'd be cool to show that now. I don't know, it's up to you. You're you're you're you're piloting the game. I mean we can't go, we can't , oh we don't have the say we have to keep playing. Sorry, I forgot this is our first play through. Maybe we'll have to do another one of these later at some point. So I'm inserting insert it. You need another Keystone. This is a different thing. I need a map fragment now. This might be getting a little too crazy now with like the the amount stones and all that stuff. Well that's okay though. I mean it's it that's what the game's for. You're basically just collecting things. It's what the game calls them that I guess is doesn't the only really changes they're all keys. It doesn't matter.

It's just a different way of calling to thing you're Soul wor you buddy. Fantastic. It also seems like you level like you get new abilities fairly quickly. I'm sure that maybe slows down as the game progresses as you can get some of those more important abilities, but you're already almost on your third which is amazing. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, there's a nice little Loop here. Yeah, there it is. What the hell was that? I have no idea. You gained another skill ability, skill ability. Let's go. I'll make another one of these save point and then we'll hit B and go back in. What's the next one up here? Oh, requires charge flame, spark flame. I have that right? No, I don't have the charge flame so Spirit magnet rekindle. What's the charge flame? I think we have to go in order. Yeah, no, oh yeah, you shouldn't, you can't pick that one. You can't just keep going with that that no I",

You can't just keep going with that that no I don't have something. Oh, maybe you don't. What the **** yeah, I need this before I can get this. Oh, I see that keeps you from leveling up evenly which I appreciate that makes it easy for me to understand where I'm supposed to go. You know me a level they're it's paralyzing. It's too much responsibility like choosing how I level it is a lot of Dying Light. We experienced that in Dying Light. Can't do it sorry. Oh dear, I don't know how much more of this I can take and by that I mean the **** sheer depression of this game is making me feel Jesus. Wow, this really does have a Mononoke feel to me. Maybe someone disagree. No, I don't think anyone would disagree even kind of the story you know is like very Mononoke just like super power. I just love how this game is like a feast for the eyes really wall jump",

Those stupid ass **** I guess let's wrap it up here. Cool. I mean we've been playing for a while. I don't want to spoil too much of the game for people, but people have been requesting and we are hearing this Nick. This is Ori and the Blind Forest. It's on Xbox One. It will come to Xbox 360 later this year. It's by Moon Studios with the help of Microsoft Studios and this code that we are using was furbished to us by Microsoft so we appreciate that very much. Uh we hope you enjoyed the playthrough and try out the game for yourself. It's a lot of fun . It's very emotional as you can see. I'm I'm certainly going to keep playing um later on so uh thank you for joining us. You can find more on",
