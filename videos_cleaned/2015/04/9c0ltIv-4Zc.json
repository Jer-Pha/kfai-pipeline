I was wondering if I can email you a short video along with my topic. The video is of an EVP, electronic voice phenomenon, I got while driving home by myself one night that is extremely clear. If you let me, I'll explain in the email. I'd love to see what you think of it, maybe provide your best idea of an explanation. So he's talking about ghosts coming through his radio. So this is his video here. It's it's it's titled real ghost EVP caught while driving. So let me pause that, drive that back, do this, click that. No, well that's not I want. There you go. Turn it up here. This is an ad. That's daoi, but that's an ad. Da OI still doing a lot of work. Good job, Dave. Good job, Dave. Here's here's the EVP.

It's basically like, hey, how how funny would it be if this **** just sent us a video, hey, I think there's a ghost and it's just, hey, I'm a ghost. His email goes like this. First things first, I know I'm not kind to win a Grammy, so I get I get it that I suck, but this is how it happened. I was driving home from work alone around 8:30 p.m. on an empty back road in eastern North Carolina, no houses or anything around, no radio or anything. I play guitar and wanted to learn to sing and play at the same time. So to see what I sound like singing , I had my earbuds in listening to Morrow by Silver Chair on my iPod. I was recording on my phone to hear myself when I listen back, I almost crapped myself. I have a brother named Jonathan, so that makes it scarier. He's a fine man, but something I'll never forget. So I guess he's thinking this ghost says Jonathan, so",

What are we supposed to to glean from this? Is it that he wants he wants our no, he wants our opinion on electronic the EVP. I've never heard of this term really. No, I see now growing up after Ghostbusters, I there was a there was a stage in my life as a little kid where I was going to be a Paranormal Investigator. So I bought all the Hans books. I forget his names. I don't want to say his last name. It wasn't him. It wasn't H it wasn't Han Solo. It was with a Z. Anyways, he had all these books about real ghosts and how it was and like his investigations and polargeist and all that stuff.

Of course, everybody remembers Sightings, the ghost alien show on Fox. It was amazing. It scared the hell out of me. I don't believe in ghosts, so I don't I don't think that that's uh goes back to our whole religion and God thing, man. It's all interconnected and I you can't I don't believe in a spirit or a soul, so you don't believe in your own soul. No, okay. I believe that I have a personality and a brain and St like that, but I don't think that I don't think that I have like a beautiful they're beautiful. Nick confirms. I don't think I have like a Transcendent uh P you know, some sort of spiritual thing in me. I don't think that.

We talked about that and like she would make me watch so much of this and it's just like it would be all this where it's just like they're in room, did you hear that? Yeah, and like they rewind and they play stuff back and it's like if you noticed it sounds like they said this this was the name of this person who died in this building. It's just just like this is so contrived. This is Keeping Up With the Kardashians. How do you believe this? Like and I'm like, oh okay, whatever you're just entertained by it like oh wouldn't that be crazy. Yeah, it's so creepy.

That's just okay, there's science whatever science. I mean it's the same when we had we had a topic a while back like what would it take for you to believe in God or or in Jesus and someone you know I think the person that asked the question was like would that person need to show up front of you even if it's almost a moot point at this at this like at this juncture Bigfoot all these things cuz I'm never going to believe it cuz I know how I I mean look at freaking any movie that comes out right now it's photo I saw a Fiat commercial yesterday I was like",
