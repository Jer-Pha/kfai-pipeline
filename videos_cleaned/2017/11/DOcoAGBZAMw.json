I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the busiest lady in the business, Andrea Rene. What's good, Greg? Not much. How are you? I'm doing well, thank you. I figured out finally, oh, you're right. We have a, it's in the Roper Report that the Animal Crossing holiday events beginning in Pocket Camp. Yes, I saw this and I finally got in here. Now I got some candy canes and I see the Christmas tree and the Snowman I need to buy and build. Yes. How much is the, how much is the Snowman? Snowman, 800 Bells. Let's see, he's 800 Bells and I need 300 candy canes. So how much, how much time is that gonna cost you? The hell knows, you know what I mean? If I just want to spend the Leaf Tickets, not, let's say if I want to order it right now, it would take me 362 Leaf Tickets right there. So I mean, that's like, that's a lot of ticket. It is a lot of Leaf Tickets. I'm not gonna do it.",

What's Good Games? Thank you. It's some, it's, it's fun. No, it's one of those things where, you know, you, as you guys know, having your own studio space, you constantly see things you want to improve and fix and change, but that all cost money. And anybody who works in video production knows it's a cost a lot of money. Yeah, exactly. We're really happy with it at this point, but there's always more we want to do.

Andrea's looking into doing some, thinking about it. So your flight home's on Sunday. Welcome out of San Diego Tuesday morning because what we're doing is waking up Monday morning, driving to San Diego, Polite Provisions, Kinda Funny Real Life Community Meetup, bad sweaters, white elephant gift exchange. Come drink and have fun at Air Castor's Bar with me, Joey, me and Joey, Jen, maybe Andrew. We'll see if we can push her over the edge. And huh, hey, he's not coming. Polite Provisions.

What's Good Games is going to be doing a meet and greet Saturday at PSX from 1:30 to 3:30 in the Marriott lobby bar that's attached to the Convention Center. So even if you don't have a PSX badge, you can come and meet us at the Marriott. We're gonna be having some drinks, planes and game, kind of just shooting the ****. Yeah, bring your Switch if you want. I'm gonna be bringing my PS4 because last year I played Paragon on the lobby.

Has Hugh do it, which is a six items on the Roper Report, half a dozen. Number one, we talked about it yesterday with Gary Whitta. Now we have Andrea here, a Destiny expert, to talk about the state of Destiny 2.

Now, this is a giant post detailing all sorts of information, getting into nitty-gritty stuff of when you're gonna see updates, ornaments for different kind of weapon sets, and all these different things. However, we talked yesterday at length and a day before that, I think, or two days before that, about the whole XP shenanigans. They call that out in the post as well.

Our intention was to keep slower paced activities as rewarding as high intensity grinding without confusing variations in display at XP values. But the silent nature of the mechanic betrayed the expectation of transparency you have for Destiny 2. They're going to talk a little bit about how they're gonna change that up even more. I haven't talked to you at all about any of this Destiny 2 stuff. Now, what's your read on this XP shenanigans and then where are you after the blog post?

I have to say though, I'm not sure how upset I was about it. I think I'm in the same camp with a lot of Destiny fans that transparency is really the issue here. It's the idea that they were keeping something behind a wall and making a false, you know, the numbers, but that's not the number you're getting, right? I think that's the issue people are having, not the fact that they were, you know, kind of nerfing your XP gains. I mean, but when you think about it overall, what are you really gaining from from doing these grinding these public events and doing these things over? I just recently jumped back into Destiny in preparation for Curse of Osiris next week. And I have also been, you know, doing the public events and doing the patrols.

Why did it just let people have it? Yeah. You know, like they're putting the time in, they're doing the work. And quite frankly, it can't be that many players who are doing this because let's be honest, they get boring after a while. Is she the same? It's the same like for public events. And I don't understand like why Bungie would feel it necessary. And I don't think we've gotten a straight answer from them if this was intentional or if this was some kind of calculation error that they just didn't fix and then was brought to their attention. I mean, I think we may be answered it's intentional. Yeah, he would have said, right? Oh, this is totally a mistake by",

So obviously, I'm upset about the idea that they were telling you you were getting a certain amount of XP and in reality you weren't. That's bad. Don't do that. But overall, on the scale of me like kind of giving a ****, it's kind of like, I don't really have a lot of shits left to give about Destiny, really, as far as like the pickiness. Okay, okay, okay. Right? Like I like went on epic rants in September about the microtransactions, about Bright Engrams, about the shaders, right? My my concerns around those things are still valid.

Well, and they just put, they finally put the Spicy Ramen Exotic Emote on sale, but it was like 300 Bright Dust. And I tried to do the math of how many Bright Engrams I would have to buy and dismantle in order to get enough Dust if I didn't get Dust as drops, right? In the Engrams. And it was like, oh, I would have to have over 0 Engrams that I would have to buy and dismantle. And I wouldn't even be able to get to keep this stuff. I would have to dismantle everything. Yeah.

He pointed that out in his name. So thank you for telling that. He writes into KindaFunny.com/KFGd and says, Hi, Greg and Andrea. With the recent uncovering of Bungie's XP deception in Destiny 2, I was wondering how you will come down on this, especially with the expansion releasing soon. I'm torn myself. On one hand, it's easy to shrug it off and say the actual consequence to me as a player from their deceit really wasn't too big of a deal. But I also can't help but wonder what else they're willing to be unethical about because they are clearly willing to be unethical. If I buy the expansion and keep playing Destiny 2, am I making a statement that says I'm fine",

If I buy the expansion and keep playing Destiny 2, am I making a statement that says I'm fine for game companies to lie and deceive its customers? Part of me thinks that's the bit, that's a bit extreme. But at the same time, it's also the truth as it means that the fact they did do those things didn't stop me from supporting them. I'm legitimately torn on what to do and I was looking forward to the new expansion. What are your thoughts? If you don't feel like Bungie crossed the line here, where do you think that line is? Thanks to all you do. And I apologize for the lengthy submission. Sean, it's a, it's an interesting tough question. We get a lot of these tough questions on Kinda Funny Games Daily. But um, Sean, I'm with you in the sense that on one hand, it's like, it really wasn't too big of a deal. But also on the other hand, then you're like saying, well, I don't really care that they did this",

But also on the other hand, then you're like saying, well, I don't really care that they did this deceitful thing. I think the scale of the deceit is important in this particular case. I think the deceit isn't so big and so bad that I would say I'm never playing this game again. I already bought the expansion upfront with the version of the game that I bought at launch. So I'm already in, right? So it's not gonna be spending more money to play next week. I've already spent it. But for people who haven't, maybe it's something that they want to pause and go, is this something that I'm okay with? And that's your personal choice and something you have to ask yourself with. It's like, isn't the value for the money worth it? Are you still getting enjoyment from the product that exists as it is?

Like if you think that you spent that money and it was worth your time, then that's really the end of the conversation. I would love to know and I wonder how long will be before we ever get a real story out of it, but how did every house it work at Bungie? Did everyone know that they were doing this, that they're gonna nerf the numbers? And I highly doubt it. So it's got to be a team somewhere, a few people who are like, let's do this and do that.

And there is this little not like the white lies kind of thing of like, we are saying we do this in a game or the community's giving all this feedback trying to answer it. Was this just a white lie where they were trying to like, let's test this and figure it out and see if this solves the problem? But it was the test is on something that so many people are doing that someone actually saw through it before they had their statements ready, had a plan in place, had all these different things.

You're creating these complex algorithms and computations encoding behind the scenes that makes the game work to you with the person holding the controller or the mouse and keyboard is a difficult job. And it's not easy balancing that. So did they potentially test out a new algorithm with like XP gains in this particular instance? And then it got discovered prematurely and it kind of got caught with her pants down. Yeah, probably. Yeah. At least we bought a hope that it's innocuous like that, right? But it's not malicious.

It seems like they're trying to get back to that, right? Yeah. Well, one of the biggest criticisms of the grind in original Destiny was at the high-end rewards, the late-game rewards for those people who had max light level, he characters across all three classes, was that the rewards just weren't good enough for how much time you put into that grind.

We need to make, you know, some of the Legendaries better. We need to make endgame content more rewarding because of how much time you have to put in to get to that content. And I'm glad to see that they're going to be addressing it. Obviously, you know, we have to wait to see what exactly that looks like, how that scales because you're still running into the same problems with with Destiny. So once you hit like Light Level 300, the grind from 300 to 305 is painstaking, even if you do all of the weeklies every week and getting the high-end rewards from stuff like Nightfall and Raid or even more difficult if you",

Like still getting those people together, it's tough at this stage of the game because the game's been out now for three months. But it's it's good to see that they're recognizing at least earlier this time around. And they did in, you know, original Destiny. It took them a really long time. And even by the end of it, it still wasn't perfect. Do you fault them for this being Destiny 2, but still not having this figured out? Having like, no, absolutely. I mean, they've had several years to work on this game. And granted, you know, they were still managing content on Destiny while working on Destiny 2. But they saw the writing on the wall and liken, you can't take a game like this that you've designed it with a 10-year road",

We're only gonna slightly tweak those criticisms for the next, you know, three to six years. Yeah. So I mean, like I mentioned, I understand that doing all of those systems is complicated and you can't really truly balance them until you get it out into the community. You know how many people are playing, you know how the progression is going to work for a wide variety of play styles across all of the different classes because your play tests internally are only gonna give you so much data.
