This story reads Marvel Studios is heading in a decade of MCU. Don't worry, there's plenty more to come whether you want it or not. In a lengthy celebratory profile by Vanity Fair, who the **** doesn't want that? The studio's building of a cinematic Empire. President Kevin Feige kept tight-lipped about those exact plans, only to say that those plans definitely exist in there and they are numerous. According to him, Marvel is 10 movies in.

Some things beyond have already been hinted at like further Guardians of the Galaxy sequels and spin-offs along several alongside several sequels for Tom Holland's Spider-Man. That's no brainer there. We know that. And there's certainly room for more with Disney CEO Bob Iger pointing out Marvel has the rights to 7,000 characters. However, the studio, we have already done the good ones. We don't need any more than that. We're gonna go far down the ****. However, the studio is also keenly aware of what it'll what it'll take to survive in the long run: new faces, new approaches, and new moods.

Avengers 4 is set to be the major turning point here with Feige stating that the film will quote, \"bring things you've never seen in superhero films,\" a finale. So we're gonna get some of the some level of finality. I mean, what's he had a finale? It did. What was that? Was that The Blob? No, it's Batman. Great scene, nice quote. \"There will be two distinct periods: everything before Avengers 4 and everything after. I know it will not be in ways people are expecting,\" he added. That's the end of this story. So if I'm if I'm encapsulating this correctly, go ahead. What do you think? Can you say something? Here's an I'm sorry. What is that? What are you worried about?
