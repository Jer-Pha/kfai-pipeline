According to NPD Group, which tracks US video game sales, the Nintendo Switch system was the number one video game hardware in October, followed by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Super NES Classic Edition system. Goddamned Nintendo in the number two spot. When combined with the Nintendo 3DS family of systems, Nintendo systems accounted for two-thirds of all video game hardware sold in the United States for the second month in a row. The US video game industry achieved hardware sales of more than 1 million total units in October for the first time since 2011. That's actually newsworthy.

So the full top 10 gonna be rolling out in the coming days as NPD does, but they give it to, you know, obviously the publishers first, let them go. No real surprise there. Nice to see hardware sold sales of more than a million for the first time since 2011. Yeah, that's wild, but you figure it's got to be driven by Mario. Oh, yeah, yeah.

And so now, I'm old-school Nintendo gamer. I missed, I like, I jumped, I, to be fair, I jumped over to like the PlayStation/Xbox generation. Yeah, I won.

And they're like, yeah, we're playing like online, it's cool. I mean, okay, cool. And then immediately they stopped. And I bought it, it was like, all right. So I was like, no, that's kind of a cool idea of having a system you can drop in on dock, playing on the console or not play on TV. But I mean, honestly, for me, I travel so much that having a system like that that I can play on a plane is great. And like, more than anything, more than anywhere else, that's where I play on the Switch. Like, I've got, I've been playing Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, right? Or Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle.

There's an interview over on Polygon. Let me jump in there. YouTubers gritted their teeth when Nintendo announced new rules for live-streaming its games earlier this year. But YouTube's head of gaming, Ryan Wyatt, friend of the show, Wiz, says he believes there are better options. Wyatt told Polygon that YouTube and Nintendo have constant conversations with each other to try to figure out how to benefit both the video game publisher and the creator community on YouTube. Wyatt said that while the question was better posing Nintendo, there are a few changes that Nintendo can make to make for a more engaged community. Quote, \"They're spending a lot of time looking at how to engage their creation community and how to handle monetization.\" Wyatt said, \"YouTubers are able to live stream Nintendo content and monetize through our non-ad products.

This meant YouTubers can't monetize their live streams and are required to stream games under a separate account. There's type of their Polygon, fix it later.

If a YouTuber belongs to Nintendo Creator Program and uploads a video with Nintendo content, they'll earn even less. Nintendo and Google each take a piece of the proceeds earned. 70% for channels, 60% for videos. Here's the big issue: If YouTubers don't sign up for Nintendo's Creator Program, they can't upload any videos featuring Nintendo content. If they do, Nintendo will claim copyright infringement and the videos will be demonetized.

And I think that, you know, Naughty Dog through PlayStation would have a better case of like, hey, you know, we're a Telltale or someone. Exactly. Our whole thing is, don't do, you know, a story. You can't screw this. Whereas with Mario, it's like, hey, look at the crazy jump I did, or how I beat this guy super fast, or his cool gameplay mechanic I did.

Bungie, I'm sorry, Bungie noted in its announcement last week that now is a good time to join the clan if you aren't already in one. It's not clear but you may have to do that before the Clarion Call begins in the examples of clan engrams which might operate similarly. You don't earn them until after the first weekly reset following your joining of the clan. We've asked Bungie for clarification and will update this article with any information we receive.

PC players, I'm joking, everybody calm down. Oh my God, the PC, it so breaks my heart. There's no cross save or anything.

Gamefreak55 also says, hey guys, today the PlayStation Blog shared list of exhibitors for PSX. I'm a little confused. Does that mean games? Does that mean games by those devs will be playable in the show floor? If yes, then that list includes Bend, Insomniac among others, which is pretty exciting. What we just talked about exactly. The they listed the exhibitors, listed the games. If you know, I I breezed through it real quick. You know, I was gonna is it news worthy? It's not that newsworthy. I didn't think. But again, if it's an exhibitor, that would mean that there's gonna be a Bend booth, that there would be an Insomniac booth. Are you gonna play Spider-Man or Days Gone or Spider-Man respectively? I",

Yeah, conventions are always a weird beast too because your paychecks, I mean, you think about it like you see something like like Red Dead Redemption 2 has not been an E3 or any other. I'm sure Rockstar doesn't either. Yeah, Rockstar. I mean, that's just weird to think that that would be a huge title that'll be one of the largest games next year. Yeah, there's like yeah, or whatever. There's a speak of Rockstar. They are they are the Pixar of the gaming world where it's like you just trust anything they release.

I you know what you weren't really making a statement, but you were talking. I was just talking. Just just saying words. This is how we do. Capitalist Pig says the idea of a bulk upfront cost for games has been tried in the past, just named differently. The large example I can think of off the top my head is the idea of a lifetime subscription that's several MMOs such as The Secret World, Star Trek Online, a DC Universe offered when they all first popped up.

And then Shredburg says, Greg, you said Skyrim is out today on Switch. It's actually tomorrow, November 17th. Thank you. It's confusing trying to keep all these Switch things and Nintendo makes it all awkward when they send you their thing. Now, will they do it? And I've had Skyrim on Switch for a week, so I don't even know when anything's happening. What the hell is up with games coming out on Fridays? What did that become a thing?
