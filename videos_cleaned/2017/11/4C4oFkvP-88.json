They sponsored the show today. You need to go there. Why do I use Blue Apron? Legitimately, because I love it. Look, eyes closed, there's no teleprompter. I am the hot pickle. I'm paid to say this, but I'm not paid to use it, and I use it all the time. Blue Apron, of course, ships you prepackaged ingredients. They send them to you. You open the box up, you take them out, you go to step by step. They give you a little checklist. They come on nice card stock, which I like. I think you can save them with where I put all my other recipe books. You save them over there. You pull out when you want to use them. You follow step by step ingredients instructions. You put it all together, you make an amazing meal in a 30-45 minutes, depending on what exactly they're sending you. Now again, I use Blue Apron. This is legitimately the Blue Apron report that is asking",

Take a shower, hydrate better, and shower would be my diagnosis here. Local media for my body. Thanks, Lawrence. I left with my own interpretation of God and religion, everything else, right? And like that. And we talked about here on the show every so often or whatever. But I just don't think that God's watching us marking down our bad deeds. I think if you're a good person, your good art. You, yeah, we're worth it. It's a good thing. I think it's the fact of when, you know, I talk about, 'Okay, don't don't that's so gay.' You know what I mean? 'Don't be a fuck.' Like, you know what I mean? Stuff like that. And I talk about that story all the time, not to say those words to shock people, but to say I used to say those before somebody was like, 'That hurts my feelings as a gay person. Please don't say that.' Like, 'Oh my God, I never thought about it.' You involved. So then I've had people",

Whereas I feel like the goddamn is based on a belief, right? We can all come around that screaming it. Somebody, 'You're a fuck,' or even saying it in a jovial stand to a person. Exactly. Like, but goddamn is like you're taking your personal beliefs and putting them on me, right? And I guess that there's an argument to be made here, of course, that a lot of people do still think gay's wrong and that these people are abominations or something. And so me saying that we're not allowed to do that, 'Don't say that, that's a bad word for that,' I guess they would say is me putting my belief on them. But I don't feel they're the same.
