I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside for the first time ever on this show, friend of Kinda Funny, world-famous video game developer Christian Phillips. I'm not sure on what world, but I'll take it. That PlayStation world, of course. Looks, yeah, folks know you, of course, from forever, right? Like you, yeah, you, you did Beyond back in the day. Did you come in for interviews and then we did PSX stuff here? I'm Kinda Funny. You were the former head of Sony San Diego Studio, correct? Now you've been out officially a year today, you told me. Yeah, I again, this whole thing coming together, amazing. That's a train rolling through. They're excited you're loved. Yeah, I'm the trash. Mad love. Yeah, no, it's, I woke up this morning, I realized, holy shit, it was exactly, it was exactly a year ago, yeah, today. How does that feel? How long were you at PlayStation? I was there 14 years.

It feels like I've been gone forever, but at the same time, it feels like it was just yesterday. Yeah, I'm still in touch with obviously a lot of the folks. Can't work there for 14 years and just kind of, yeah, just, yeah, you know, and to end it. But it's been amazing. Obviously, it's been, and it's been a bananas year for me, so it's been great. It would even up to you embracing the indie life. Yeah, you know, I've been in games 25 plus years now, but they were all with hardware manufacturers. So, you know, well, I got a lot of amazing opportunities along the way to to learn development and be part of making games until you're a true game developer, yeah, there's just a lot of shit you just really don't.",

You think that, uh, that not all publishers give a shit, really, yeah, about their developers. Okay, it's amazing. Um, I want to name names. Gonna lay people, right? No, not really. I'm not looking to put people on blast, but those folks know who they are. I, I, I think they would, you know, I'm incredibly fortunate that I get to work around and with publishers that do care. Um, and it's their caring that I think more highlights the lack of caring of others, right? So it's not, sure, sure. You see me going above and beyond, right?

Of course, Marvel Heroes, the action MMORPG, whatever the hell you want to call it, from Gazillion. It was a deal that had happened before Disney bought Marvel. Disney buys Marvel. Marvel Heroes is ongoing, but I've apparently no more.

Marvel Heroes, of course, came out quite some time ago. It's basically Diablo with Marvel Heroes. I played a lot of it. I played it. I mean, I bought the Founder's Pack on PC, which would have been 2014-2015. Kinda Funny, complex, wrong. Even I'm pretty sure it's 2014. Uh, David Brevik was on board at that time. He, he stayed on a while too, but he left recently. Of course, Anthony Gallegos, he was former a co-worker of mine at IGN, now over at Gazillion as well. No date on when it's shutting down. It sounds like it's pretty evident, like it's gonna be pretty gosh darn quick. Yeah, well, I mean, this, this has been coming for some time.

Yeah, this is on Marvel and this is on Disney. This is not on the Gazillion. Yeah, I'm guarantee they're a ton of incredibly talented folks there, of course. But when your publisher or your, in this case, the license wars is well, but like, when you don't have a really clear way of building community and acquiring those users and a plan and an understanding of what it takes to run the LiveOps, that's probably been, you asked me earlier, one of the big lessons I've learned is I got a real wake-up call leaving Sony as to what it really means to have a LiveOps team running in the game when it's, you know, a game as a service like this.",

I was on the morning show today, so I don't know if they've announced a date since then. KindaFunny.com/You'reWrong. It looked right before I came on. Oh, cool. It's expanded more with more context to it. And as I'm a Marvel Heroes fan, as somebody who subscribes to the Marvel Heroes subreddit, I've seen something's wrong for a while, right? It has been the community be like, hey, you, you do weekly updates and you haven't done them in 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks.

And I don't know if I expected it to come like this because this makes it sound like the servers are off. And I don't know if that's true and I doubt it is, but I don't know what they're getting into. But it, it's, it's 100% on Disney. It's 100% on Marvel. And as always, I've been earning this reputation here, the corporate apologist. I don't, I mean, I think it sucks. I like Marvel Heroes. I loved shipping away on on PlayStation 4. Jen is when I put out my tweet today morning. This Jen said my leg, which is that one of the audience bites, you know, done over and over that she's had to listen to a million times.

And it seems like the scuttlebutt, you've heard some of the people who are getting unnamed sources, they've just never been a big fan, but they've kind of had to honor their agreement. And now the agreement's over. And it's similar to, I saw recently over the weekend that Deadpool was getting pulled from Steam. I think this week, the Deadpool game, once again, licensing is up. Like, you have, you don't get to sell that in perpetuity forever. If you're Activision, you, or yeah, Activision, you have to, when they green was done, the game is done. Yeah, so this sucks and it's horrible. And I love Anthony. I love all the people I ever met at Gazillion, but it's like, shit business, you know, it is. This really is.

And we had back then, I had the incredible honor of getting yelled at by David Stern for not waiting for the approval on the title of the game because it was initially Kobe Bryant's with a yes, yeah, yeah, tone NBA Courtside. And he, he said loudly informed me that, yeah, he didn't own the NBA, right? And it put, I almost lost my job that day. Yeah, we've already gone to print on packaging, you know, a bunch of stuff. So we ended up that that game. So when you look at it, the packaging is correct. We managed to fix that, but the in-game title screen still says, nope, it's Kobe's NBA. That's funny.

And that's the thing I think when we talk about this, it's, it gets weird and dicey when you're talking about games as a service, right? Right. But Marvel Heroes, I don't think I stress, is free-to-play. You can get on there and yeah, microtransactions get in that way or, you know, play for free, all these different things. But when it's that kind of game where it's survival year after year, month after month, week after week, is the license that's where it gets difficult because you hear devs all the time or even fans be like, I love new IP.

You know, launching new IP to your point, everyone asks, clamors for it, but then they're super reluctant to invest. They, they're apprehensive.

And then shortly after that, in September of last year, was some time right now, actually, I guess this community and then you got it wrong. I should know it's August timeframe. We went live with Kill Strain, right, which was also free to play and and also a new IP. So super-challenging. Learned a lot. Obviously, Kill Strain unfortunately didn't have the the numbers and the performance that we wanted. Yeah, and that really cut and came down to user acquisition, user acquisition.

And that's worth what you're, what you're being asked to pay. Well, yeah, you know, it's also very much in the news right now. Yeah, exactly. Oh, we'll get to that here in a second. Don't worry. I want to kick it over to Mark English though, who wrote in to KindaFunny.com/KFG D and says, Greg, that's a proponent of games as services and as a fan of the game, Marvel Heroes.

How do you feel with Disney having shut down the game today, according to Kotaku? Do you feel you wasted your time or money in a game that was out for less than a year and will soon be unplayable? Or do you think it was worth it for all the fun you had? Going forward, do you think that more of these higher profile games as services will have shorter half-life due to the competition they face from other like games? Thanks, Greg and Tim's husband. Toss you in the Christian from loaded questions. So let's break it down a little bit, right? He's specifically talking about Marvel Heroes Omega on the console where he's saying, do you feel he wasted your time or money? Worth pointing out that my time is my time. Of course, money though, yeah, I had gotten when I, when they send me review codes, I unlocked all the packs through codes they had sent me. And with like, I was talking with a Spider-Gwen.",

More importantly though, Marvel Heroes overall, again, when David Brevik came by the first time for his first Up at Noon and showed me that game and talked about that game and maybe it was just a demo, but what I digress, I went and bought the Founder's Pack for 150 bucks and played on PC and bought more stuff there with real money. Yeah, how do I feel about all this as a fan? It breaks my heart. Marvel Heroes Omega is a game that I still like.

The biggest the thing that makes me about all this whole argument is when people just want to throw microtransactions in general or bad or in me saying that then throw it back in my face that I'm corporate apologist and what I keep talking about is this balance between art and business and that's what games are and we haven't figured out a way to make them just art where you can get a government grant and make whatever the hell you want in looking for a profit.
