They sponsored the show today. You need to go there. Why do I use Blue Apron? Legitimately, because I love it. Look, eyes closed, there's no teleprompter. I am the hot pickle. I'm paid to say this, but I'm not paid to use it, and I use it all the time. Blue Apron, of course, ships you prepackaged ingredients. They send them to you. You open the box up, you take them out, you go to step by step. They give you a little checklist. They come a nice card stock, which I like. I think you can save them with where I put all my other recipe books. You save them over there. You pull out when you want to use them. You follow step by step ingredients instructions. You put it all together. You make an amazing meal in a 30-45 minutes, depending on what exactly they're sending you. Now again, I use Blue Apron. This is legitimately the Blue Apron rep that is asking",

Here's the thing, nah, didn't didn't do it. And they didn't do it because like, here's the thing with Blue Apron, of course, you get the food sent to you. If you want to make it into their dish, great. If you don't, freeze it, use it later, whatever. I think I ran out of time that week. I froze it. Now I got some salmon there ready to go.

They made him a horse. They made him a harness for Darian. Well, no, but they made a good to his mother. No, the my my topic is mainly just, it's very very quick. I'm curious to think if you think Rey and Kylo are going to switch sides. So if Rey is gonna go down, he's gonna go light. Hold on. Or Rey's gonna go, I agree, Kevin, Rey is gonna go dark. I'm Rey's gonna go dark with with with Kylo at the end of The Last Jedi. Wow. Or they'll stay the same side and Luke Skywalker's gonna die. I will say so what do you think? It would be **** awesome.

Yeah, so there's dark, there's light, and then there's what they're hinting at is Gray. All right. Well, yeah, but like that's my thing is I I ideal world need something like that because you have this stupid war going on for the better part of what, like 50 years? Come on, man. Someone's gonna come in and just at this point you start going like, maybe the Empire had a riot. Like, maybe they were, I mean, they were horrible, but they did bring order to a lot of good. Like a lot of people like P.M.R. Only it sounds like only you. My thing is everything you just said, I think there's an equal opportunity.

And again, that could all change in the next couple weeks with TV commercials. But based on what they've officially put out there, this movie's coming up in a month and a half and we don't know if Rey is gonna end up good or bad thing, right? They hint at it. Okay, I'm sorry. So I did not know any of these theories were a possibility where they stand the trailer of like get like Kylo reaching his hand out and he's like, you don't know if it's the same scene or not of the same exactly.

So here's what I think is gonna happen. I think I think Rey's is going to Kylo and Kylo is gonna offer his hand to Rey to come to the dark, come to the dark side, much like Darth Vader did to Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back. I think Rey will reject it. I think Rey will reject it and I think at that point Kylo will end up beating Rey in some sort of fight. She'll go down off her hand and then Luke Skywalker is gonna have to defeat Kylo and then also Snoke, but he's gonna die in the process. I know I know that's gonna happen. I think no, I think Luke's gonna fight Snoke, kind of beat him, sort of sort of like a Voldemort-Dumbledore fight. That's my thing.",

Is this Episode VIII you're talking about or is this, you know, The Last Jedi? I think I think that a dying, I think, oh, I think Luke's gonna die. Yeah, I think there is a chance we're gonna lose Luke in this. Oh, yeah, yeah. Not good chance. Yes, you have to. You have to do the Dumbledore thing. You have to have you have to take that like in Harry Potter, they had to take Dumbledore out of the equation. Always the question of likewise and Dumbledore's coming here and **** him up.

It was enough of a dude that was, but they have to do that, right? I really feel like they can't. Luke can't come and save the day. Rey is the main character. She's the protagonist of the story. She has to be the person that eventually causes the biggest change in the story. My thing is, I would love to have Kylo be redeemable by. I don't see it. There's no possible way. I think, yeah, ha, once he once Kylo, I was like, you're never gonna be redeemable there anything. And so do you think, I don't know if you guys have seen the trailer again, in the Rey thing in the trailer, she's gonna kill his mom, Leia, as well. Not a chance in hell. No, no. Leia. Okay, Leia",

Okay, I think I think she blows up on her ship or something stupid on this one. I don't think so, man. I don't think so. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. The thing that makes me really bad about teamed up about The Last Jedi is when Force Awakens was coming out and you guys might remember every trailer, I was breaking things down. I came up with the entire plot in the movie before it came out and nothing that ruined it for me because I still **** loved it.

Where he's like, the Jedi has to end. Yeah, or whatever that line was. Like, the Jedi has to come to the end. That is fascinating because that is saying, hey everyone, I we're not gonna repeat the same cycle over again. We're not gonna have you beat the dark side and bring balance the **** Force. Something else thing, something else has to change. We have to do something different. And I'm hoping that is indicative of the next two movies.

But now there's a lot of pressure from the the **** nerds out there. They're like, you can't just give us Empire again. Even though those nerds are also saying, give us something like Empire. Give the exact same Empire again. I think that more, I think people would be happy with it. I just would be disappointed. I think that people like what they're gonna like. But what I'm saying is I I feel like in order for it to really be a, this is the first Star Wars movie since the new ones have come out that I think all eyes are on it where it's like, you better blow us the **** away.

And that there's so much pressure on it. And I I do feel like they have to switch some things up. And Luke's saying good, him staying bad. I think it's too easy.

I mean, like Attack of the Clones is the worst. Episode I is the second worst. And then Revenge of the Sith is the best. Absolutely. Get on the ****. Not even close. Attack of the Clones is so far worse than all the other ones. I like Lord of the Rings as a franchise better than Star Wars. Shoot, pick and choose. I think The Lord of the Rings trilogy is better than the original Star Wars. Is great. They're great films. They're not better than The Empire Strikes Back. You can't out bring The Hobbit into this argument because you don't have any ****. We don't have a Star Wars fans. We don't have ground to stand on. You can't make fun of The Hobbit and then have him bring up the prequels. We're **** and ease off. Kick at Mike and he's saying he doesn't like Star Wars. I just really I just really think with the crew they have right now and the energy they have",

I just really I just really think with the crew they have right now and the energy they have right now, how awesome would it be to go back and rewrite those, redo them and do them in a different way? And again, I I just don't I don't buy that audiences are that dumb. And maybe I'm giving way too much credit to people that they wouldn't we wouldn't be able to like, we're just gonna do another set of them. It's fine. It's fine. People don't freak out. We're just gonna do it again. What Star Wars on anything? And I really do think you have a going-forward. You can do another trilogy with Rey and Poe. You can go back in time and tell before all this stuff. Like you're what you know, nice. The Old Republic. Call the movie **** that and just do some stuff. There's a plenty of things to do. Don't say remake the prequels is very low on the list. Yeah, high canon. And if they did, it'd just be totally different.",
