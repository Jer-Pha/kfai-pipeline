It has been way too long since Smash Bros. Wednesdays, the old days back in the Kinda Funny Let's Plays. I missed the times when we just have a big TV and Smash. That was just be there way back. That was when we worked at a gym. Oh, and hope do you want Dad to come over here and take off the belt and take you to ten? Nick clipped it on. Well, I clipped it onto your pants because you don't wear a belt. It was just strange there. Butthole is literally hanging out of your pants, right? Yeah, you do see a lot of undies. Hey everybody, Party Mode goes up every Wednesday early on patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames. One week later on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. It's been a while since we played this. There's uh, some new characters that I don't think you guys are five clever. Palutena and Corrin. Oh, Corrin. Corrin was a character. Oh, all",

Let's go right now in the Party Mode. Put in a 15-minute retrospective on Nick using Pit all time. Be cheap. I'm played against Nick for a while. See, you're not used to cheap stuff. Nick isn't cheap. Whatever. I've seen Nick sit on the edge, shoot arrows on everybody. Everyone who is watching this video currently has as well. You are, you, you know, you're the Kinda Funny Pikachu. I just want you to know. Thank you. You're not, you're not quite the Detective Pikachu. Ya don't need a degree for that or what?

No, that garbage. Say we don't play that. Really? Are VG? We don't play no games. I'd say that like lies. Our one last time, Tim and I beat you all in Battletoads. Decided.
