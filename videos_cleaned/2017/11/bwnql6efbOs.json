They sponsored the show today. You need to go there. Why do I use Blue Apron? Legitimately, because I love it. Look, eyes closed, there's no teleprompter. I am the hot pickle. I'm paid to say this, but I'm not paid to use it, and I use it all the time. Blue Apron, of course, ships you prepackaged ingredients. They send them to you. You open the box up, you take them out, you go to step by step. They give you a little checklist. They come on nice card stock, which I like. I think you can save them with where I put all my other recipe books. You save them over there. You pull out when you want to use them. You follow step by step ingredients, instructions. You put it all together, you make an amazing meal in 30-45 minutes, depending on what exactly they're sending you. Now again, I use Blue Apron. This is legitimately the Blue Apron report that is asking",

This is legitimately the Blue Apron report that is asking me to rate my latest deliveries. Stir-fried beef and broccoli, five stars, it was amazing. Now here's where it gets interesting, right? Mushroom and red rice casserole. Kevin, does that sound like something I'd like? I liked it. I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm giving it four stars. Then salmon and honey glazed carrots. Here's the thing, nah, didn't, didn't do it. And they didn't do it because like, here's the thing with Blue Apron, of course, you get the food sent to you. If you want to make it into their dish, great. If you don't, freeze it, use it later, whatever. I think I ran out of time that week. I froze it. Now I'm gonna get some salmon. They're ready to go.

Bruce, I want to talk to you about the Let's Play Family. Okay, everything. There's a lot of times on the Reddit of the Facebook group, whenever we do events, we recently did the Let's Play Reunion and whatnot and all that. And a lot of people are like, oh cool, like I'm familiar with Funhaus, so I'm familiar with Achievement Hunter, or I'm familiar with Cow Chop, or whatever.

Yes. Kinda Funny. Let's start with Kinda Funny. Kinda Funny are in three and like three or four senses. Oh, a bunch of **** knuckleheads that probably wish you'd stayed where they were. Okay, so let's be honest. I think he's totally wrong. I think you guys are the more of the industry standard of video games. I think we come to you for the, the most inside video games knowledge as well as personality. That's the way I've always looked at you guys.

But again, lots and lots of personality, which I appreciate because, you know, a lot of the times if you're at an IGN or if you're at a GameSpot or whatever, you sort of have to tone it down a little bit. And you guys are not to do that because you're your own group and that's the way I've looked at it. I think there's the, the amount of video game knowledge in this room blows my mind. So that's why I've always looked at you guys that way. Thank you. He says what? He's right. He's right. He was wrong about Dunkirk. All right, but what's the next group? Cow Chop.

I throw some in the air like they could steal Cool Greg at any moment. Their tough guys would love to have Cool Greg. They are the, they are the live-action, they're the Jackass. They have the looks like, um, 100-day play video games. They're very, very funny. Alex and James are inbred, are just like funny, funny dudes. But they're fantastic at the live stunts. They're fantastic at the stuff that like, you're just like, oh, like it's really crazy. You saw Jackass 2 and then you'd see another Jackass, not that was even **** crazier.

Like it or, or you can't spin it for Nick because I had this great idea for a prank. Okay, right? But it wouldn't happen. But it would be that if we got a car dealership or a car sponsor, we had a new car, we're gonna give it to Nick. What I wanted to do was we drive two different cars to Outback Steakhouse for lunch one day and we have cameras set up, of course.

They're, they're turning into what they're doing is like they're changing the way vlogs work. I think they're training on a sign of it. And like we've seen it a lot done with Arrested Development.

And Morgan's like that. But they want Sugar Pine 7 quality. Yeah, they do. You want that? Oh, that's interesting. That's true.

They said that you guys are either gonna love each other or try to one-up each other so much that each other or just someone's going through a plate-glass window.
