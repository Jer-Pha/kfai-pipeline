Let's him most now what's the deal with these LaCroix? What's the deal with these? Look, there's a new LaCroix. There is a new LaCroix. It's not this no 19 flavor-wise. You drank normal cans of LaCroix forever. Now you're coming in with these Skinny Cans, these skinny cans. There's three flavors, well technically four with the Cola flavor that weird mixes. No, I I'm just gonna avoid any of them. I was like, I'm not gonna do this because at one point GIO's like, I don't like them. So I took that as gospel. Sure. But now I've tried them and two out of three of them I'm cool with. I just don't like these keys that look like this. Me neither. You know, well this Skinny Can trying to prove, I don't know.

For now, the first item on the Roper Report. Phil Spencer, Xbox Big Daddy is popping off all over the internet. Ha ha. Let's start at Bloomberg.

The company plans to increase investment in developing in-house video games, including starting or acquiring studios to do so. Xbox chief Phil Spencer said in an interview last week that's an about-face from its approach the past several years, during which Microsoft has shuttered studios, canceled games and faced criticism at an industry conference from gamers for its lack of hot first party titles. Quote, \"We need to grow and I look forward to doing that,\" Spencer said. \"Our ability to go create content has to has to be one of our strengths. We haven't always invested at the same level. We've gone through ups and downs in the investment.\" End quote. Microsoft on Tuesday will start selling the Xbox One X, a high-end console targeted at hardcore gamers.

The company now tracks monthly active users and revenue from software and services and is looking at opportunities such as further expansion of Xbox Live online usage, esports and games streaming. Quote, \"This means fundamentally rethinking how we measure progress in gaming,\" Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella sat on a conference call with analysts last month.

So right there, Tim, mm-hmm, we're talking about growing. We're talking about bringing more studios, developers into this Xbox one thing, right? Getting more games exclusively to Xbox. Something Phil Spencer shied away from before as he says here. But they need to grow and need look forward to it. Has that sit with you? This is great news. Yeah, overall, there's a lot of interesting stuff in there from the the other woman, the CEO. Yeah, the yeah, Satya. It's a woman, right? Satya. Yeah, okay.

Like remember we're time out like the Until Dawn style. Think of them like, how can we figure it out that the Twitch streaming experience is thought up from the game level as well as the service level of what your box is doing? So when you combine that with them finally talking about admitting that they have a problem with first party output, I think that this is good and this signifies at least a roadmap to a better future for Xbox to be able to quote unquote compete again with PlayStation in the sense that they want they're not happy with being second and they want to have that fight again.

Now that look, I voted in is its own new story of course. But you take that, you couple it in with these statements that they understand what they're doing. That gets sounds like Xbox is getting aggressive again, which I like a lot. Cause yeah, we mean is obviously now we're to jump to the Wall Street Journal where again Phil Spencer and Satya are popping off.

As its building as its building game Minecraft does. Mr. Spencer acknowledged console sales are important, but said Microsoft is more focused on growing game software and services. He said the company measures the success of its gaming business by revealing the number of people who use its online service Xbox Live.

Phil said quote, \"Today we ship Minecraft on other platforms. We all know that. No plans to explain expand this right now.\" Yeah, but again, talking about what we've talked about before is if the Xbox as a box as a console can't turn it around, did they go third-party? Do they just start publishing games? So they want to go that way? I mean, I can't imagine a future where that's the case. And I feel like that's easy to say now looking back at Sega. Who would have thought that at the time, right? But I feel like there was more talk about Sega going going down back then. There there is a Xbox. Sure. Because they're still doing very well.

Our metric for success is the things that we're successful at right now. And like that's a good PR spin, right? And I think they're going down that. But it's like them talking about these first party games. I don't really read this as meaning that they're gonna be on on PlayStation. That doesn't make sense. I don't really think that they're kind of talent lies in their first party software development currently. Yeah, so I don't know how much there is to gain from them going multi-platform.

Phil Spencer got promoted to the senior Microsoft Council or some like that. You know, some kind of cloak-and-dagger society that meets in rooms and snakes. And when they put out the press release saying this stuff, not the stabbing part, just the promotion part, um, they didn't ever mention Xbox. It was very much that Phil was coming in to focus on the gaming of Microsoft or the future gaming gaming of Microsoft and all these things. And I read it there and I said, that's a very interesting way to say this. Why aren't they saying Xbox is is Microsoft's vision for gaming as a whole going forward?

I'm not trying to put two and two together here to say that's it's the same thing. But you bring up this thing of like their first party lineup isn't that strong. And I think most people would agree with you, right? I mean, there's there are exclusives coming. But in terms of wholly owned and operated Microsoft's users are putting stuff out. What are we getting? I think that's only half the picture.

And it's gonna have enough of the market share and mind share to you know, be worthy investment. Something interesting here is the gaming to make Windows more successful is not the path of there down. And Windows has always been interesting to look at in the in relation to the Xbox. Like at E3 the last couple years where it's like, it's a really look, it's Windows 10 running on a SoC kind of or it's a version of that or the games are also playable Xbox Play Anywhere and all that.

Again, Xbox is doing well. It's not doing as well as PlayStation. But for a bean counter somewhere, for somebody who's just looking at profit lost statement, stock rises. When do you start saying, cause they from the beginning, right? Microsoft was taking a bath on the original Xbox, you know, the OG Xbox. But yeah, at what point you say, all right, this is cool. We've learned a lot of things. But we've learned that partnering the Bluehole is a way better strategy to get make money off of video games. I don't think it's imminent at all.

Xbox Live had 53 million active users at the end of Microsoft's fiscal first quarter, up 13 percent from a year earlier. In overall gaming revenue increased by one percent to 1.9 billion.

What do they have to do to turn things around right now, Tim? Games. I mean, that's really the answer. It's exclusive game experiences. Like the PlayStation had those and it always has had them. What PlayStation didn't have was a great online infrastructure and it didn't have all these little bells and whistles last generation. And they're like, okay, we need to fix that.
