I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the busiest lady in the business, Andrea Rene. What's good, Greg? Not much. What's good with you? You know, some sad news this morning, breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, as we wrapped up Kinda Funny Morning Show. Yeah, Telltale's laid off a whole bunch of people. So let's begin a show with what is and forever will be the Roper Report. Time for some news. I like that you're doing a somber beat. I'm doing everything that, yeah, Roper Report has five items on it today, technically six. Now six. I thought they got updated. My apologies. No, I just updated it. This is how fast this happened. Exactly. You know more than me, Andrea. What's going on? So a press release was sent out by Telltale Games indicating that they have let go of some of their workforce. So over at Game Informer, they summed it up saying Telltale has announced today that the developer is suffering layoffs and an overall",

So over at Game Informer, they summed it up saying Telltale has announced today that the developer is suffering layoffs and an overall reduction of 25% of the company, around 90 employees. So their official statement says the decision is designed to make the company a leader in player-driven narrative games, more competitive as a developer and publisher of groundbreaking story-driven gaming experiences with an emphasis on high quality in the years ahead. These changes are not expected to impact the release of any of the company's previously announced projects. So the story on Game Informer continues to say the developer was best known for their narrative-driven adventure games like Batman, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Tales from the Borderlands. Obviously, if you watch the show, you know that we talked about Telltale Games all the time and they have been growing steadily over the last few years by getting big licensed games. I'm just",

I'm just in September, they named Pete Hawley from Zynga as the new CEO, laying the groundwork for restructuring. So clearly this is probably, you know, the fallout from them bringing on a new CEO. He's taking a look at the business and saying, listen, we got to cut the fat somewhere. Clearly we're having some issues with overall profitability and that's what CEOs do. They come in and they look at how the business is running and look at all of the different essential functions and say like, where can we optimize? Where can we make efficiencies where they weren't any? And Telltale is a relatively big studio, which I'm sure a lot of people aren't aware. I'm just on LinkedIn, there are 386 employees under the Telltale banner, which is quite a number considering the type and style of games that Telltale Games are known for. I",

I'm just on LinkedIn, there are 386 employees under the Telltale banner, which is quite a number considering the type and style of games that Telltale Games are known for. I mean, these aren't massive giant open-world games with a lot of art assets or a lot of external or extensive coding and programming and production that's happening behind the scenes like we see with a lot of other larger studios. So that's quite a massive workforce. So really, while it's really obviously disappointing and sad to see this happen, we never like to hear about people losing their jobs, especially right before the holidays. I'm not surprised by this announcement at all. No, I mean, I think honestly, for in a lot of ways, it's long overdue, not the layoffs, but the restructuring and the idea, right? I mean, Hawley's quote here, right, that you have from Game Informer's, \"Our industry has shifted in tremendous ways over the past few years.

The realities of the environment we face moving forward demand we evolve as well, reorienting our organization with a focus on delivering fewer, better games with a smaller team.\" Then Telltale also hopes this restructuring to focus on the technology of their games, an issue that's been plaguing their games for several years now. I feel like we've talked about Telltale recently on Kinda Funny Games Daily and that's what it comes back to is the fact that this studio hit it big. You know, I mean, like Telltale was a small studio and I remember seeing Sam & Max at Comic-Con on a card table and then they got The Walking Dead and they got The Wolf Among Us and then every franchise suddenly wanted to work with them because there was a hot ticket and that was great for them in terms of growth, money, and all these different things, but not in terms of",

Absolutely. And while it's, you know, going to be really difficult for the people who have been let go of their jobs, I have been part of the layoffs before. It sucks, especially the first day, the first week is really pretty terrible. You know, I have seen the outpouring of other developers in the industry putting up links saying, \"We're hiring on our team, please come apply,\" which is always so amazing to see the the camaraderie of this industry really come forward in moments like",

I think this is the statement that the CEO made today is going to be good for fans and hopefully it's going to be good for their team. You know, you always want to take a look at how is company morale doing internally? Now, obviously, we would need to talk to people at Telltale to ask them, you know, did you see this coming? Did you anticipate this? Because a lot of times, most people at companies that are part of a layoff did see it coming. Sometimes it comes out of the blue and it's even more difficult, but I mean, sometimes also though, the writing is on the wall and I think you were right in saying that this is probably the case",

You know, people there and the people who have left have talked about morale being bad. And I think when the new CEO was instituted, that was the first sign of, \"Alright, there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\" because I know it wasn't a great place for some people to work. Obviously, other people have great times and everybody's experience is different. But even with I, you know, I always go back to, we saw them lose a whole bunch of leadership when it was Nick Herman, Pierre, and somebody else who I always forget when I bring up this example, left and",

And I remember that being a big deal that like, \"Hey, Ubisoft just picked up these three people.\" I got like a press release on its own from Ubisoft, I think, of, \"Hey, we just picked up all these people from Telltale.\" And that's not like to say they hated Telltale because I don't know what their opinions were on it, but it is like, that's a red flag when people who have there and are making like your premier games like, \"I'm gonna jump in a group to something else. I'm gonna go do something there.\" And then just to hear from other people who have been there over time and how leadership was there, there was always problems and it seems like power struggles.

Woody, we were talking, it was in the Kinda Funny Morning Show. Everybody knows Woody. He lost his job today too. He was working over on a game. And so it sucks for everybody. But as you pointed out, and as we talked a bit about yesterday, on Kinda Funny Games Daily, right, because there was, I don't know if you heard it, right? I did. Yes, I wrote in. I was like, \"Hey, there's all these layoffs. Is this a bad time for the industry?\" And it was like, \"No, it's actually still better than it used to be where it seemed like there was layoffs every bleep month after you shipped a game or whatever.\" It's just part of the cyclical nature of the game dev business.

When you take a look at the amount of studios that have the fortunate opportunity to keep their team at the same operating level even between releases, it's very few and far between. You know, most of these studios have to go through cyclical hires because they need to bring on people when they're about to launch and then they need to scale back after they ship, right? That's just a nature of the creative business. I mean, you see that in the film and TV business all the time too, right? And this is another, I think, to look at Telltale laying these people off today, and as much as it sucks, and this is always the struggle between the art and the business and people who make your games, this is a direct result of everything we as the fans and audiences have been saying for years, right, of like, \"Your engine sucks, fix it. You're making too many games. They're forgettable.\" Guardians of the Galaxy is wrapping up and it's",

So if that means that, yeah, you know, like they said in their statement, everything they've announced so far is still around. All they've announced so far, right, was walked in terms of new things, was Batman Season, which has started, The Walking Dead, and the next Wolf Among Us Season Two. So if that means these games get more resources, more time, and maybe even if they don't, maybe these are the last games that are on the old engine before somebody sits down and really rebuilds it, more power to. But yeah, sad news today. And also, I think news that shows in the video game industry, right, like, bigger isn't always better. I think that's something you, you know, so many people do",

We're not calling it a showcase given that we're coming a few weeks off of Paris Games Week, but we'll have some cool content to share.\" People not happy. I'm not surprised people aren't happy. It it's tough because being in the United States and being American PlayStation fans, we are lucky enough to be here where the PlayStation Experience happens. Yeah.

So from a forum, I got an actual like optics perspective. When you look about marketing, I think it makes sense for them to do different kinds of announcements. It certainly doesn't make sense for them to do two full-size press showcases this close to each other. Sure. Now the confusing part is why they're doing both at all. I feel like they really should have picked one or the other. But if you pick one of the other, you kind of have to pick PSX because you've now set or you've started the tradition of having a media showcase at your fan convention, whereas Paris Games Week has only had a PlayStation and media showcase once before this year.

Thus, that's probably why they decided to go forward with Paris Games Week. But I mean, why they wouldn't choose Gamescom earlier in the year to kind of give themselves room to breathe and that way you can kind of hit both of those camps. Sure. I don't know. I mean, to be a fly on the wall in the room where all those decisions were made would be really fascinating. I think it's a little disappointing for people who were expecting something like we've gotten in previous years, but they've we are setting up the expectation, which is important. It's good that they're managing the expectations early that don't expect a bunch of game announcements at this show. I'm with you to an extent. The problem is this,",

That's absolutely a fair criticism because I think now let me, I'm gonna bring Whitta into the conversation. He wrote into KindaFunny.com/kfgd and says, \"For the past few weeks, we've been wondering what Sony will be doing at PSX. Will they have a press conference, a showcase, nothing? Now we finally know in what they describe as a presentation. So far, this has been a nightmare of communication with many people in the comments, at least, confused about what exactly is happening at PSX this year, what their tickets are paying for, and what exactly this presentation is going to be.\" So my question is this, is PSX becoming that more community-driven event that you all were talking about?

Did PlayStation make a mistake having a Paris Games Week press conference? Will it diminish the value and hype that surrounds PSX? I think back to the point of bringing it all together. I think that this is the year that they lay out what PSX can also be. For three years now, we've seen PSX and you thought you knew PSX. And for me, that's why it was okay when it came together super late every year because it seems like every year it comes together at the eleventh hour of like, \"Oh, now this is happening.\" Okay, figuring out their identity.

And it's just for PC, it's not for other platforms. You see, spoilers, spoilers, not really, but spoiler, they're like the new Assassin's Creed confirms or whatever.

I think people can do whatever they want as far as criticism goes.

Is Microsoft and GameStop having a secret war over Xbox Game Pass? Let me explain my thought process. My GameStop in the St. Louis Market is one of the busiest out of all three districts. Mergers are fun. And had 7 combined pre-orders of Scorpio and Xbox One X. We only got 8 combined units total. Looking at the rest of the city, no store got more than one or two free sell units, meaning they weren't, you know, pre-order. Meanwhile, Target and BestBuy.com had Scorpio pre-orders available",

Best Buy stores, where all my online multiplayer friends got theirs, are giving me reports of Best Buys having 40 pre-orders with an additional 40 free sells. Now, looking at the Xbox Game Pass, the entire catalog is made up of older Xbox One and backwards compatible Xbox 360 games that are GameStop's bread-and-butter. And in most cases, one of those titles physically cost as much or more at GameStop than the $9.99 monthly price of Xbox Game Pass. So, is this Microsoft's way of subtly removing GameStop as a competitor by trying to get homes with internet access, not a given even in St. Louis, into the habit of just buying digital instead of physical?
