No, today we are playing Nidhogg 2. Remember, Party Mode comes out every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m. You can get it on youtube.com/KindaFunnyGames. You can get it a week early on Wednesday, not in a Patreon.com one dollar. Andy, is this one we worth the dollar? Yeah, hopefully what people wanted to see us play. Yeah, and their answer was Nidhogg 2. Nidhogg is what everyone's brought up very high. If I'm gonna get right into it, we played Nidhogg 1, yeah, a lot of fun. We did Nidhogg 2, very gross looking. I feel like we're at a real party right now and Nick is just the guy that sits on the couch and pets the dog. Little time. I'm totally fine doing that. If I could just chill here and not play this game, I'd be cool with that. I want to go the rainbow place. What's the rainbow place? The clouds in my bear. Here's another Barry reference. All right, Hawaii, let's",

Okay, yeah, it's just like, dude, wait, what? There's no run. Tim, run. Get there, get there, get there, get. So the dude who ever kills have the advantage to run. I remember like this.

You know what? Greg's pulling out all the stops to get this guy's **** ride. Just don't even, don't even engage. Engage. Just run, just run, just run too. Don't you think Tim had such confidence in that hero? Hey, I don't have my phone. Hey Google, I'll ask Siri. I'm ask Siri. Siri, but how do you throw? Cheers. What I found on the web for how do you throw? Now Siri doesn't know. I'm sorry, guys. The other day Nick was like, you know what? I like going to the carwash 'cause I like sitting there, I'm watching my car get washed and just reading the news on my cell phone. Oh, I thought it was so smooth. Well, here's my problem, Andy. I want a new phone, but Apple in their infinite wisdom will not sell me one. Yeah, Tim, you're so close. Oh no, Tim, Tim. Oh yeah. Oh my gage. Tim, don't engage. Are you kidding? You'd hurt. Stop me. **** kidding me, Tim, you",

What's the attack button? An extra-inning baseball game. You're like, man, I'm tired. It's 1:30 in the morning. Like how you like great into a news. Have you noticed that? Oh God, you men. It's a time. What happens? New food there. Can we just let it go? **** you. You got it. Oh, do we never play anything? You apart. It reaches inside your soul like the art style. Greg, just be cool. Now you're good. Greg, Greg, you got it. Greg knows the great to let it go. Let it go. I'm just writing. Hey, come on. You need to stop your **** run. Greg, just write. No, we're gonna go.

Yeah, there you go, Greg. Not see Greg. God, he knew I was never. I think my patterns **** downloaded. Nidhogg came in Greg's advantage. Now Greg said we have a great tested, but he tested the lesson of this crazy mind. No, it's not like I have to be in the stupid arena. I love this extreme level of **** talking and then, oh, oh ****.
