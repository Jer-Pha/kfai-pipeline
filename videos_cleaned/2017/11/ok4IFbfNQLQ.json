That that the Rotten Tomatoes delaying their score. I mean that's cool what everyone else is talking about that they want to do a show on that that's cool but I mean look you good people are upset about this I understand that but at the same time Red Dead Redemption 2 early impressions of it. I know exactly where that film is gonna celebrate it. Yeah, use in this time way. I just don't understand what I fall into it as well. I'm not gonna lie like I am I am a number like fanatic if it's real high in Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. Rotten Tomatoes are things I couldn't give a **** less about.

That's that's something to talk about when it's like oh this the difference between even like a 30 to an 80 right? Just too much **** range. Well, it's a you know it's also highly subjective right? And it doesn't necessarily mean success which is unfortunate like those two aren't necessarily to each other right? If you remember Blade Runner 2049 had like I think it was above 85 maybe it was almost an even in the 90s at a certain point tanked right?

It's not like he got knocked out but he took some he took a **** beating and then they both took a beating that I don't think I should fight.

Not much to get more about just exploring that world and telling a story through a lot of the visuals and with light. Watch it again and just pay attention to the actual frames.
