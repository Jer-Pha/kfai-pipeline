What's good with you? Uh, you know, it's almost Friday. It is almost Friday. Is my Friday? Oh, yes, because you're not going to be here tomorrow. Tomorrow, I joined a well, Jean Vo Saint Bones Mullerian Portillo Miller, go to Maryland for the Extra Life, the sequel to last weekend, going out there to stream, play hard, to talk with the Irrational Passions folks for Team Kinda Funny. You can watch it, of course, on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames and Twitch.tv/IrrationalPassions, I assume, but we'll be hosting it. Yeah, was it, what are your weekend plans then? Um, this weekend is the Day of the Devs here in San Francisco, which is an annual event where a bunch of independent developers get together and showcase their games. Double Fine, a flagship sponsor of that, so probably a swing by there, see some games, sure. Um, and then I",

Yes, yeah, so I'm going to try to chip away at the hat, right? And then maybe sleep a little, business getting out there, actually catching some sleep. Yeah, I feel like I'm starting to make progress. I got the Horizon DLC done, started Call of Duty last night, started playing Switch version of Doom, going to go get Moons on this plane ride over there, going to hopefully play some Destiny's before IO 13, stuff like that. Yeah, oh, I do also want to remind people, since we're talking about some housekeeping, it is Veterans Day, and there's a lot of fantastic streams that are happening over on Twitch to benefit different military charities.

Andrea Rene, on yesterday's show, Andrea mentioned the Xbox One X had a feature to suspend gameplay and have it instantly back on with a controller. She mentioned the PlayStation 4 Pro doesn't have this. I have a PlayStation 4 Pro, and I go into rest mode during a game, I can power it on and I am right where I left off. Is there a difference with this or the N in the Xbox One implement? I'm pretty sure this is on the original PS4 and Xbox One. It was, that was a 100% mistake on my part. It just slipped my mind because I haven't had that feature turned on because I think it got turned off somewhere along the line because it's tied to the power save settings. So you have to go into your power save settings and specifically make sure that the suspend feature is on. But yes, it is available on",

The problem with you is that you're so good at your job that you said it so commandingly, then I was like, oh, it, I guess it sounds a little bit different because you were talking about like, hit the button and you're right back into it, which I've had PlayStation 4 games where I put it in system mode and come back and for a second it's like, whatever, Horizon's your dog load screen, not load screen, but like key art, and then I'm back into the game.

No, no. Number one on the Roper Report, however, is GameSpot has an excellent Shannon Loftus interview up. I'm calling it Radical Transparency. I'm going to read excerpts from this, but you should go to GameSpot.com and give it a read as well. Well, movie, because let me give you, even with the context, I get this question all the time of why do game developers, why do game publishers work in secrecy so much? Other industries don't do this. Now let me read you the article and your name. Okay, while movie studios might let fans know about films coming years down the line, for example, we know the fifth Avatar movie is coming in 2005 at 5:00. I wouldn't hold your breath.",

I wouldn't hold your breath. Video game companies are very rarely that transparent when it comes to their release schedules. One part of this culture of secrecy might be, might be for competitive reasons. Announcing a new project years in advance could give other studios time to react and respond. But another major element to this is that games and movies are not the same in how they are produced. Shannon Loftus, who heads up first party production at Xbox, spoke with GameSpot recently about the culture of secrecy in gaming, when the right time to announce the game and the pain of cancellations. Quote, games are a highly experimental medium, Loftus said, and it's a line that we have to walk between talking to gamers about the games we would like to make and knowing that we are going to be able to deliver them. The worst part of my job",

The worst part of my job is when I have to break promises. Obviously, we Crackdown 3, planned for a November 7th launch, and we had to announce a few months ago that we had to move it. I'm very conscious of the fact that that hurt people. Folks, folks were very excited and they got very disappointed, and it's not something I like to do. Jumping ahead in the article, talking about this and how it's different, Charles Randall, who worked at BioWare and Ubisoft, addressed gaming's culture of secrecy in a Twitter post that went viral earlier this year. He said much, he said such secrecy exists because of the toxic culture in gaming. Quote, you know why we have to keep what we're doing secret from the public? Because the toxic culture surrounding it, he said. Randall acknowledged that marketing has some role to play in why games are",

Quote, God help you if you let any amount of the public, any might of the public know what you are working on before it's set in stone, he said. One new trend in gaming that is changing things is the early access model. Games can be announced and released before they are even finished, and this can be extremely lucrative. Loftus said Microsoft is studying that very closely, and the company is already involved in that space with its Games Preview Program. It sounds like you can expect further investment in that space from Microsoft going forward. Intriguingly, Loftus said she would like to see a game developed with Radical Transparency, which is pretty far from the norm for Microsoft and other",

Goddamn it, Kevin. It, I think, is one possibility, she said. I think Radical Transparency is something I would love to try at some point as a game developer. Like, hey, here's three takes on a concept, which one do you want? Pretty sure Phil Spencer would be supportive. End quote. What do you think? This is a really interesting idea that I think looks good on paper, but when I come to, in practice, it would not work, because as you know from working with an audience as large as the Kinda Funny Best Friends, people just have so many different ideas.

So I really love the idea of this Radical Transparency and the idea of like, oh, producing the game with your audience. And we're seeing more of that with early access. Even, I would even go as far as to say with Kickstarter. I think when Kickstarter first started, it was very much backer updates, what would you like to see, how would you want to go, what's your reaction of this system? The, the other problem there was something like that is that so much of the audience does has no background in game",

The, the other problem there was something like that is that so much of the audience does has no background in game design or game development that while they may ask for certain things, they may not realize that what they're asking for is not feasible or possible to do from a production standpoint. Sure. And that will then set you back because then you're constantly having to explain to your audience why you can't deliver the thing that they're asking for. Yeah, which is probably one of the major reasons why game development is secretive, because they want to be able to iterate in the background without having to constantly change their message, without promising a feature and then withdrawing the feature and having to face the wrath of their audience. I mean, we're seeing like one of the games that I'm close to that was in early access and I got to see forums and see patch notes and see the back-and-forth",

And watching it really split and divided the fanbase of that game because some people were on board for the change and some people weren't. It's one of the, you know, pitfalls of early access. And I like, I said, good on paper. I don't think this would ever work in reality. Yeah, there's got to be a middle ground. I would feel that. And I don't want to say a reality show.

And I feel like, you know, even like you brought up with Kinda Funny, where we're, you know, or a blip on the radar, we're nothing. But we, our own audience all the time has discussions of like, I love guests on the podcasts, I hate guests on the podcasts. It's like, if you serve one, you automatically go against the other. And trying to find that, if you're just running back and forth trying to respond to criticism, you're just running in a circle. You're never going forward. You have to have a vision for what you're doing and push forward with it. And I think I have seen games on Kickstarter that are still on Kickstarter and just in this",

And that's the other huge part of it where you've seen a rise in Community Managers, right? Is the reasoning that you can't be making the content, be doing something creative, and be responding and talking and communicating to your community effectively, because when it comes at the, the sacrifice to the other, and that's trouble. I, is it, is that interesting thing of, I hate the fact that Charles Randall here is talking about, you know, the toxic culture in gaming, but I understand what he's saying, right?

Whereas if you sit there and you work in prototyping, your friends and, you know, colleagues that you're there to be the red team on it and go back and forth, eventually, about time you come out three years later and expose, here's what it is, people don't know what it was going to be. Because I feel like there's been so many developers who've said to me in interviews or something, basically the effect of, you know, when you get a game that's 70% division of what we wanted, 30% of it had to get cut off and left behind.

Yep, interesting. Nobody should see how it all continues on like this. I love the idea of developers being more transparent, leaving the show. Do you not like the new chair?

This is Eric Hirschberg, of course, Activision CEO, talking in Newsweek. Sledgehammer wanted to make Advanced Warfare 2, he said, told Newsweek. A sequel to Call of Duty 2014's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare seemed obvious as it was regarded positively by fans and critics alike. But Hirschberg and his colleagues saw a deeper trend emerging from their million-strong audience. Many fans called for the franchise returned to its real history roots.

Blurb. Interesting to see how the idea actually came to be, because I know for what years people have been sent, or not even years, but most recent years, people have been calling it for, let's go back to World War II, let's do all these different things and stop going into the future, cyber exoskeletons, we're in space and all this other stuff.

And I think that has a lot to do with how this particular war was so poignant for millions of people around the world that you kind of can't take too many risks as far as gameplay goes with this because then you're floating, crossing the line of being too radical and you're gonna get into that position where you can't appease everybody, right?

If you even look at a studio like Naughty Dog and what they've done with the Uncharted series, they didn't need to radically innovate the gameplay because they've made it with such a level of polish that that is a feat in and of itself. For me, I think what's interesting about why I'm playing it and it doesn't feel like well-worn territory is that when I look back at when I, like, I guess PlayStation, probably when it's when I was still playing these first-person shooters, Medal of Honor and Call of Duty's, and being in World War, that was so long ago and such a different time for me.",

Kici\u0144ski says the company will probably return to the world of The Witcher because both fans and investors would be disappointed if it didn't. That presumably means the game set around different characters or in a different time period, although Kici\u0144ski didn't go into any more detail. I mean, how could they not return to that world?
