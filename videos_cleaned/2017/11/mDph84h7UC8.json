Oh, hey, hi, dude. I'm good. He's arriving out there. I am getting it done. Yeah, it's weirdly cold today, which I appreciate after all these goddamn hot days. It was so nice to have like fall, San Francisco fall here, and it's I think like I it was a big deal. I think it was what the cold stuff started last week, some point maybe, and I took the first hot shower in weeks because it's been too hot. I run hot, and I if I take a hot shower, I'm sweaty all day. Yeah, can you stop? Kevin understands. Kevin gets it. As a man who had pizza and Coke for breakfast today, Kevin understands more than most. It was weird to walk in this morning, me like pizza. It's such, it's awesome. You don't give me mom, but it was unexpected. How unexpected is a great way to put it. It was, no, he asked me if I wanted it, and I said yes, and I went over there and",

Yeah, it was intense. Kevin Senor's. Yeah, that's that. So that's a meal right there. They're giving you. I did you say this the other day that Senor's Pizza, your favorite pizza order out of here? No. Okay. I might've been there. I think Nick, Nick, Nick came around to that. Yeah, here's the good thing is we don't order bad pizza around here.

I was like, this is even better. Mmm. Now we've been doing Senor's easily. This my good. When do Pan Pizza on earth once here? Yeah, no, it doesn't. There was some conversation of like, it didn't, yeah, we thought it deliver here. Yeah, and then also one time we wanted Domino's, and I drove to Domino's to pick it up. Where is there even a Domino's by? Uh-huh. Follow up question. Where is there even an IHOP? The only city that's so far away from the movie theater. Yeah, actually, you're doing pretty good.

The conglomerate is still upset about what it considers a biased story critical of taxpayer money going to Disneyland in Anaheim, but it is now rescinding a directive that had shut out LA Times reporters from Disney movie screenings. Quote, we've had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at that Los Angeles Times regarding our specific concerns, and as a result, we've agreed to restore access to advanced screenings for the film critics, Disney said Tuesday in a statement. Disney's reversal of strategy comes as journalists and filmmakers express their solidarity with the LA Times.

Twitter officially double-doubles character limits on tweets. This is super simple obviously you've all seen it too they've gone from 140 characters to 280. Joey, what do you think as someone who has to write a lot of tweets for this company?

I'm gonna still keep trying to keep it short and yeah, yeah, I don't want it. I don't I like that about Twitter. I like the brevity of it. Exactly.
