Pixar movies can be hit or miss, yeah, for me, especially when you talk about the sequels and stuff. Like some of the sequel, every once in a while you get the Toy Story 2 and 3 and fantastic. Well, every once in a while you get a Cars 2, it's not. So did you watch Cars second one? So you got a Cars 3, which is like, it's pretty good. Okay, it's pretty good, right?
