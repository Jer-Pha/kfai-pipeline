You've all been so great at supporting Cooking with Greggy, but I'm no master chef. I don't know how to cook a lot of stuff. That's why I love Blue Apron. Jen and I get easy meals we can whip up on a whim, and I get to learn how to make couscous or fish or something else I've never heard of. You sign up, pick your menu, and they deliver pre-portioned ingredients with step-by-step instructions. You just follow along, make the meal, learn something, have a good time. They've even included this handy little flowchart the last time I did it, teaching me how to make sauce from the fond. It's got wines in there. It's like a flowchart, like I said, that it's cool. I'm gonna laminate it again. This isn't something they wrote for me. I'm literally telling you things that are happening in my couch. If you know a good laminator, hit me up.

Here's the thing, we recorded this episode on when it's going out. So this might be a little, a night one might have already watched. The thing is, American Vandal going to be on Netflix forever. It's, it's an original series, so this is going to be relevant forever. And I feel like it's the type of show that you might miss out on if you don't hear about the hub of at the right time, right? So in the future, when you're watching this, if you haven't seen American Vandal yet, I recommend you watch the show. Why, Nick? Because it's really good. It's really good.

I should know I have not finished this because Tim told me yesterday, Nick, go home tonight and finish American Vandal. But we all had a really such a good time with Max Landis that I decided I was gonna start Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. Got hella into that. Forgot about American Vandal for a night. Came this morning, was like, ****, ****, I should have finished it. But it's really good. You goofed, man. It is done in the style of Serial and Making a Murderer, in that style. Yeah, exactly that style of right now. Have you, have you been listened to Serial? Oh, yeah. I, I, all those true crime docs, Shadow of a Doubt, Serial, The Jinx. I'm on there.

They didn't really prove anything. They didn't get the guy out of jail. And I was like, no. Maybe the life, though. It is the only situation where I can think where there's actually, you'll find some kind of resolution is The Jinx, just because there's that crazy moment when he's in the bathroom, he says, kill them all. Of course I did, or whatever. Yeah, you did such a good spot-on impression that it just gave me a flashback. I was in that moment. Guys, **** freaky, freaky. This freaky ****.

But the thing, that's the thing about Serial, though, is that they would do those like, it's obviously a beautifully produced show that keeps you riveted. And it's from, from start to finish. I'm like, wow, this is like, I'm really into the story. Like, I want to know if they made this phone call, and I want to know if this was even possible, and yada, yada, yada. But as you go on with it, and you look like it, when you finish it, you look back here like, yeah, some of that was completely ridiculous. Like the part, which is like, and that's what had me really concerned. You like those moments that I feel like people would smoke weed, listen to, and go, you know, we should make a show like this that's 40 million making me up.

And yes, then that's what keeps me up at night. It's like that alone was enough that you could tell, you could see the seeds of where the creative ideas from American Vandal came. Like Sarah Koenig, who's the Serial producer, she, it'd be ten episodes or eight episodes or whatever, and she'd explore every red herring, right? So just when you think she's on, she's presenting now to you what the most valid argument and suspect is going to be, that at the end of that episode, it's revelation. Allow, actually, was this is where this, this, you know, investigation ended, right? For this specific person. But that's what I loved about American Vandal watching it, because so Greg sold it to me, and he was like, dude, I watch this. It's so funny, 'cause I, my first introduction to the show was my TV was on, and we had just finished watching some ****, and then it was just cycling through.",

Does that for some reason? And it was just like the thumbnail for it, but it didn't say American Vandal, and it was just a picture of a bunch of cars with dicks on it. I was like, what the **** is this? Like, that doesn't make any sense. If that was like, all right, whatever makes it work. Greg was like, dude, I just watched the show American Vandal. It's about drawing dicks on cars. And I'm like, tell me more. But the thing, the thing that they do so well in this show is obviously its satire, and obviously it's making fun of those. But I am legitimately invested in who drew the dicks on these cars. And it's actually, it's, it's actually a well done like whodunit.

Now, granted, I haven't finished it, and I swear to God, I know there's got to be no **** resolution, because it has to be no resolution at the end of it. But if it's such a well-done show, like from production design, the acting, acting, the active talk about camera work, the cameras mandating, let's talk about the motion graphics. Like, yes, what's the 3D ****? Oh my God, the best part. The thing that **** killed me was when they were like, could someone have ever seen the **** on the pier? And it goes in 3D, and it's just one like red character jerking off another red character. I was like, guys, are **** twisted.

And the best thing is, they commit so hard to it that even the opening credits, all the credits are the crazy kids' anime, not the people who directed the actual series. It's the name of your character, Sam Ecklund. Yeah. And kind of the main suspects are the AV Club, just be done. They would have had access to like the cameras, everything. But, but what I loved was that the reason, because the, the main like perpetrator, what's his name? Dylan. Dylan Maxwell. Greg, don't Greg.

I mean, obviously, we are kind of behind the curtain on a lot of stuff, so that I feel like there's an extra layer for people that are really into internet video, right? Production, a lot of stuff, because there's so many jokes that are funny, like Marge and Babies. Even something as simple as Dylan's making shitty YouTube videos, whatever. But this documentary team, the AV Club, puts theirs on Vimeo. First episode being like, wow, I'm so hooked, 'cause it ends on the first episode's cliffhanger.

Edit, there's not a wall the entire time. There reaches a point in the middle of the series where I'm like, it's been four episodes since we've even seen Dylan. Yeah, I don't care, 'cause it's **** good. Yeah, I think for when I was like four episodes in, I was reminded of the four episode run that Castlevania had. So four episodes, and I was like, surely it's almost done, 'cause how can they possibly keep this up? And it just kept going and kept going.

It's a great satire of those podcasts and those shows that they present every single avenue, every single suspect. They explore every opportunity that could have conspired to make this crime happen. And that's what makes it feel so real. And the basic premise is so immature, and it's done, it's so stupid. And that's what makes it even more compelling, because they found a way to weave a narrative around just this like base and idiotic. And it's hard to it, like it, maybe this is where there's something's like towards the end that I don't want to spoil, but I feel like the last episode and a half really kind of like puts everything in perspective of this, this type of **** affects people's lives.

I'd like to believe that if I were a high school teacher, I didn't win when, okay, so there's a scene, Elyse, we're square.

And I was telling Kid that Jimmy Tatro, he's, he's a YouTuber. I didn't know that, right? Yeah. So Jimmy Tatro plays, according to Jimmy, the main **** up guy named Dylan Maxwell.

I granted like Serial was a cause and they were trying to like actually bring more awareness to it. But at the same time, I'm like, this is **** riveting. And I wanted more of it. And I had, I didn't really care if the kid got off or not, you know? But like the ramifications it has in the lives of the people that are accused but proven innocent.
