They chose us to be in it because they have a great sense of humor. That is true. So we're gonna have a lot of fun stuff to talk about. Everybody said, \"Oh no, right?\" What's that? Everybody else said no. They were basically like, \"You are, we're down to the bottom of, we're all - have you - who the **** helps give up or both of you into spandex, yeah, and hope to God that you don't burst out, you know, in front of the kids, those kids.

Greg, Joey, and General be joining Irrational Passions in Maryland, in Maryland this weekend. I'm assuming we have a schedule somewhere up on that. If not, follow Greg because he tweets incessantly and he will tell you what's going on with that. More like Balta-less. Haha, just kidding. I offended Cisco with that Balta-less joke earlier. Multi, we all saw that on Twitter. Well, the thing is, if you're gonna do a joke, don't tweet it first. Do it, invent tweet. I didn't tweet it. No, I saw your response and Balta-less.

This broke yesterday, but we didn't get a chance to talk about on the show, but it does definitely warrant us going over it a little bit. Rian Johnson, writer, director of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, had to create all new Star Wars trilogy. Hold your slow clap because I have some thoughts on this. For director Rian Johnson, Star Wars: The Last Jedi was just the beginning of his journey to a galaxy far, far away. Lucasfilm is excited to announce that Johnson will create a brand new Star Wars trilogy, the first of which is also set to write. He's also set to write and direct with longtime collaborator Ram Bergman on board to produce.

Quote, \"We all have worked with Rian and The Last Jedi's of Kathleen Kennedy, President of Lucasfilm. He's a creative force, and watching him craft The Last Jedi from start to finish was one of the great joys of my career. Rian will do amazing things with a blank canvas of this new trilogy.\" She was on to say, \"We had the time of our lives collaborating with Lucasfilm and Disney on The Last Jedi.\" I'm sorry.

Below is a statement to EW that he requested to be posted in its entirety. Quote, I wanted to address the stories told to The New York Times by five women named Abby, Rebecca, Dana, and Julia, who felt, that's four women who felt, you're gonna be able to not name themselves and one other who did not.

The power I had over these women is that they admire me and I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions and I've tried to learn from them and run from them. Now I'm aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday that the extent to which I left these women who admired me feel badly about themselves and cautious around other men who never have to who would never put them in that position.
