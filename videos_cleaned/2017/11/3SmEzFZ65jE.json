Thank you for coming back. Am I always gonna be Rogue One? I have to come up with something new so I can be silly. You've done a bunch of, I mean, I have a self, not complaining, but sure, you've done a bunch of stuff in your career. Would be considered the met the best nut. You're actually in The Roper Report today, which is interesting. I don't know. Oh, I forgot my, I'd left my notes on. You will get your notes, alright? Because is there like an F'ing that can go get those for me? Not while JoJo is just a nice, nice woman or a nice person. Yeah, always just the F'ing business of it. I'm Harry F'ing, if anything. Are you thing? Let's let's just nip this in the bud. Two weeks ago, Gary, when it comes on Kinda Funny Games Daily, he does a great job.

So then we get two shows with Gary, with a Rogue One's Gary Whitta, Book of Eli's Gary Whitta. We got two shows back to back with him. Everybody on the subreddit, everybody in the forums, ever in the YouTube comments, \"Gary Whitta is great! Gary Whitta is great! Hire Gary Whitta to reply.\" I don't go to those. Like, maybe I should stop visit. He's don't with you've got a big head. Go it. \"Hire him to replace Danny! Make it make Gary Whitta one of the Kinda Funny.\" Like, you and they all started knocking on my door, knocking on my Twitter to get you to come in here permanently, to have you be a reoccurring person.

It's a longest essentially my lunch hour. Oh, so it's a night part. The reason why I've enjoyed doing it, it's a nice way for me to get out of the house. I'm a homebody.

Our games that receive great critical reception over the years, perhaps the best example being Nex Machina, which we published in June to great critical acclaim, garnering a Metacritic score of 88. Nex Machina was a dream project as we got to work with our hero, an arcade gaming legend, Eugene Jarvis. I jump ahead a bit.

For your unfailing love and support, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. But now it's time to move on to new genres. Lackluster sales of Nex Machina have led us to thinking that it is time to bring our long-standing commitment to the arcade genre to an end.

What were their sales goals? Was that game a success to them? I think for a Housemarque, they are a fairly large independent studio that makes great games.

And maybe younger gamers who grew up a generation after the likes of me will feel less sad about looks. They don't have that same connection.

And now this feels like a big bellwether. Like if Housemarque are getting out of one of the one of the top developers are saying, \"We're getting out because it's just not viable anymore.\" I feel like this shit is this kind of gate, this kind of video game, which is so specifically connected. Its roots go all the way back to the the genesis of video games of Space Invaders and Pong and Defender. If that's going away, that's really sad. But here's my question for you. Isn't this if we talk about Housemarque leaving this space, the arcade space, and then say, \"Well, arcade games in general are dying.\" And I mean, arcade games on a digital platform, not an arcade.

Because my argument would be that, you know, for your Geometry Wars, your things that these are simple games, great graphics, different things. People gonna put twists on them and stuff. I still think that the independent market has the ability to make those.

And we had playtesters come in and play it and every single person saved it. And we were like, you've been begging for this joy. You've been begging for this opportunity to kill him. We gave it to you and none of you took it. And they were like, when when the moment came, I just couldn't do it. Like, I had to save him. Yeah. And so we had to go back.

We had to reshoot that scene because the playtest demonstrated the choice was broken. Not not yet. Even though people are gonna drop down because they hate him, they hit him with the peeler telling us, but it's a big difference between what you say and what you'll actually do given the choice.

We look very careful about whenever we do a Clementine because we know that players respond to yeah, so powerfully. It's like she's like the Kryptonite to play it. So like we don't want to use her all the time, but we need is that what can we do? It's like I think I think he needs to put Clem in danger because we knew that people would have such a visceral reaction to that and it works. People started dropping him. Yeah, see, and that's what's fascinating because that whole thing that was one of my choices why I was like, I'm I was already against you.
