We're supposed to, you know, we're like social media influencers, we need to say that apparently, otherwise the FTC rolls up in a big bus and they go, \"Hey, you, you're bad!\" Enjoy Party Mode. What's up everybody, welcome to another Party Mode where Kinda Funny gets together and plays crazy games like Friday the 13th. Seven-person Let's Play, it's gonna be crazy. If you love Party Mode, remember Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames. Each and every Wednesday, you can get the episodes right there. If you want to wait a week and get them later, that's fine, YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. I'm a counselor, let's meet everybody else. Cool Greg here. It's Tim Time. What's up, Andrea Rene here. Oh hey, it's Joey. And I'm Nick, and I'll be playing the role of Jason Voorhees. In sync, hate when Andy bites my lines. Did Nick say he's Jason? 'Cause Nick's Jason so far.",

Do we think Nick is actually going to successfully kill anybody? No. Tim, how confident are you in Nick's ability to kill us? I'm feeling a lot better about this. I've only, there's my second round of Friday the 13th ever. I think we're gonna get some people to escape. Oh yeah, 100%. I hear some people talking shit. I would say a solid four people will probably escape. I love how little faith you guys have in me, but you killed us and I was the first. Yeah, yeah. So with Nick, I feel a bit better, although he is targeting me, but he won't know. Nick's not gonna know how to do jack shit in this. He knows that I am Chad with the Ass Guard.

As you do though, as you do. I fucking hate that I have little shit never-nude shorts. I don't mean to be that guy, but whoever Joey's character is, she got some chunk at the trunk. Tim, move out of the way so I can close the door. There's a walkie-talkie in here, Andy. Oh yeah, all right. I have a flare gun. There's that grab. All right, I'm gonna grab him. So I'm gonna grab him. Fuck, wait, how do I, did I drop the flare? I did. No, go back and get it. Nick was complaining earlier about how dark his TV is. He was not joking. Tim, what are you doing?
