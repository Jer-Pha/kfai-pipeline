Let me tell you something, I'm telling you, Greg, it's been, you know, it's been a crazy few days for me. It has shot off to Maryland, did Extra Life there with the Irrational Passions. Thank you all, of course, for watching the Irrational Passions stream, but thank you, the Irrational Passions kids, for stream of four hours. Thank you, the OK Beast crew, for streaming for seven, I think it was, hours, maybe eight. Right now, Team Kinda Funny on Extra Life has raised about $85,000. Holy crap, putting us within spitting distance of the year's goal of $110,000, which means I'm gonna probably have to stream some more at some point. I think we're so close now. I know I gotta cry, I gotta just push it a little bit. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, I've been frazzled with that. Mm-hmm. I got a new iPhone coming today for you. Love that one, Greg.

Jen and I are trying to set up our own Slack, which has been a whole nightmare of trying to log in to talk to cross-platform, talk easier, because I don't have a Mac, because everyone here hates Macs. So we iMessage all day, but then I put the phone down and then it's a pain in the ass when I'm working. Do it. But if I have it all on one screen, no problem. You walked in, I was trying to get Kinda Funny Games Daily ready. Turns out everyone got mad about Battlefront again while I was gone. There's so many things happening. We'll talk about here on the show, but I meant to point out, you look really good. Oh, you walked in in your black. Thank you. Your beard's coming back. My beard is back, boys. Yeah, yeah.

For now, let's begin the show with what is and forever will be the Roper Report. There are two items on the Roper Report. Doesn't know why I also you say that, Kev. Item number one stretches on. I saw that. Three, three pages. So it's gonna be strapping that we've done well. I feel we've done well with the moratorium on the microtransaction loot crate. It wasn't, there was a couple weeks there, whereas every show with, hey, this is what's happening here, somebody else adding this in. What are we gonna do? Pandemonium, pandemonium. We did fine.

But while I was gone, while do we can hit Battlefront II exploded. Yeah, just out on the landing pad. I'll start you from the top. All right. So this is gonna come from multiple sources. We're talking about Star Wars Battlefront II, of course, out tomorrow. First off, there was a post over on Reddit. Someone put up, basically, over there, it started breaking down how long it would actually take to unlock all these things if you didn't pay any money. It's a very detailed thread. It has spreadsheets and all sorts of stuff. I'm gonna kick it over to Kotaku, who explains, by some estimates, the likes of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader could take close to 40 hours each to unlock for the player intent on not spending any money on microtransactions. Heroes cost credits in Battlefront II, with the average multiplayer game currently netting people somewhere between 50 and 350 for 10 to 15",

Heroes cost credits in Battlefront II, with the average multiplayer game currently netting people somewhere between 50 and 350 for 10 to 15 minutes of play. The road to buying all of them appears like will be a long one. Luke and Vader are two examples of the most expensive heroes at 60,000 credits each, but even heroes like Leia and Chewbacca still cost 40,000. Here are some calculations one user on Reddit came up with: The average Galactic Assault match length is 11 minutes, 9 seconds. Average credit per match is 75. Average credits per minute of gameplay is 25.04. Our gameplay minutes required to earn a Trooper Crate, 4,000. That comes down to, I'm sorry, that so it's 4,000 is how much you need to get a Trooper Crate. It's to get it in minutes wise, 159.73 minutes. Gameplay minutes required to unlock one hero, 395.97.

So a lot is what they're saying there's, if you don't want to spend a dime, right, this is gonna take you forever is what they go. The Kotaku article goes on, talks about that there are, there are challenges in the game that can help players accrue credits more quickly, but these are limited. Once someone has finished them and cleared out any of the remaining milestones, the only credits coming in on a per match, the only other credits coming in are per match basis. Of course, daily crates can occasionally give you credits, but any Star Card duplicates will be broken down into currency as well. But neither of these is gonna significantly change your finances. That's the Kotaku summary. Good job as always. Over on Reddit, though, this is popping off, exploded on the Star Wars subreddit, to which EA's community team responds,",

As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the open beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we're looking at average per player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making consistent adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course, attainable via gameplay. We appreciate the candid feedback and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums, and across numerous social media outlets.

Oh, this then led to people giving death threats to the people on Twitter who make the game, and the usual ugly side of the internet you get expected to see. Now, well, I want, we're gonna tackle all this, because again, in terms of who wrote in to KindaFunny.com/KFGD today, a whole bunch of you did. And I would say 90% was all about, what do you think about Battlefront? If you give your perspective, which we'll get to in a second.

What I'm getting interested in, of course, with the accessibility of social media, how our industry is tied into everything happening, the people now popping off online about this and giving their perspective. I'm gonna kick it over to Guerrilla Senior Producer Sam Sharma on Twitter. All right. I followed him for a while, of course, talking about Horizon Zero Dawn. But he put up a thread all about not this in terms of Star Wars Battlefront II, but about microtransactions from a developer side, which I find very interesting. Let's go. 'There is a lot of very passionate discussion this week on the various sides of the microtransactions and loot box debate.

Publishers will give a budget and a profitability target and guide towards best practices based on their existing portfolio slash market conditions. Tough. Publishers will urge proven mechanics to minimize risk. In all cases, the development leadership decides the best way to maximize profitability for games. In extreme cases, there is a pub mandate to put in mechanics to ensure max profitability, but the way the mechanics work and the specifics, parentheses, drop rate, pricing, are all developer led. I wonder one argue as to specific mechanics and whether they are a good practice or not, but please know that development is complex and a publisher does not simply put",

I also don't intend to shut down discussion as it is very interesting to read differing perspectives and learn. I am always here to learn more. And various perspectives on a complex issue help me grow as a developer. Also, also, I work for a lovely company and an amazing publisher, and these views are not endorsed by them or anyone here. I'm sorry, anyone there. So please subscribe all blame towards me.' Interesting take from a developer side, right? Yeah. Then us video game industry analyst for the NPD Group, Matt Piscatella, on Twitter, chimes in, 'Some of the most aggressive marketing ideas I've ever heard have come from devs, while some of the most adamant pushback on marketing, I'm sorry, microtransactions, actually, MTX.

'Some of the most aggressive microtransaction ideas I've ever seen have come from devs, while some of the most adamant pushbacks, push back on microtransactions I've seen has come from people at publishers. This idea of the big bad publisher and victim dev is in my experience a myth,' which I found super interesting. Yeah, it's ****. Let's throw the blame everywhere. Well, it's, it's, it's fascinating to see Sam Sharma coming out and then Matt Piscatella coming out and being like, 'I love this.'

And this is a great thing of like, hey, let's pull the curtain back in a very public way and talk about the fact that they're now, granted, they're not saying what they don't know what's going on internally at DICE and how this is all worked out and blah, blah, blah. But it is interesting to say that this isn't always the case and it sounds like isn't most of the time the case that it's a publisher saying like, hey, we're gonna **** milk every dime we can.

So yeah, it's interesting. I, I will say that I love the transparency and I think that it's important. It is a good step. And at least there, at least there is another side being stood up for, because otherwise it's just publishers getting shat on and, you know, yeah, and Activision, there's pure evil and that's just all that people know. But the problem I have with it is at the end of the day, this is just putting blame somewhere else. This is just trying to push it off.

So I think then, just like we've said a million times in the countless days and days and days of us talking about microtransactions, I think that there was a right way to handle them, there's a wrong way. I think that every game, there's, it's context sensitive. And this is a perfect example of this sounds like the wrong way. Yeah. Will they change this? I have a feeling they're going to have to. Yeah. And it is a ever-evolving thing where it's cause and effect and people give feedback and then they have to respond to it somehow. And I think that these numbers are egregious.

But I think that this is the type of thing where you can look at and even if you aren't going to play it, it's easy to be like, well, that is just wrong. Now, here's an interesting wrinkle to this. Wrinkle me up, Greg. Jeff Clark writes into KindaFunny.com/KFGD and says, 'I like the fact that we have to earn our heroes. Supposedly, it takes around 40 hours to unlock a character, which is not a huge amount of time in the world of online multiplayer. The biggest problem for me with Battlefront I was that I had nothing to work towards. They",

I put the hours in to get this because I love this game. Keep up the great work. Love you.' That is very true. But I think back to Halo 3. Yeah. And I remember the, you haven't, you have your custom armor or whatever, the Samurai helmet. If you saw someone run around the Hayabusa helmet, you're like, 'Holy ****, that guy's good. That guy hit level 50 or whatever it was.' Did you had to do, that guy loves this game, put the time in to get that. That's **** awesome cosmetic. Yeah. That to me is the difference.

Oh, I think it's still not cosmetic. He's cooler. I'm sure Darth's powers are a bit better.

Easy to get the 1,300 kills or whatever the hell it is. But then it is that thing is, I continued to play Friday the 13th week after week, I'm slowly doing that damage to it. Could it be possible that when DICE was designing these multiplayer awards, they weren't thinking of it from the skin of rubbing **** money?

DocDoomII writes in with a question that I thought was new but it actually it's like from the beginning of the month but I'm pretty sure I never read it. I thought I was still interesting so here, okay, mm-hmm. Hey Greg, what are your thoughts on games creating timed content that can only be accessed for a limited time? I'm referring to Hitman's Elusive Targets and Assassin's Creed Origins Trials of the Gods. It looks like the developer/publishers are trying to create a new trend to force more people to buy on day one or possibly very close to the game released. To me though, it feels like they want to try and force us to buy and play on their time schedule and not ours. And I don't like it. What if I buy their game six months after release? What if I buy it on day one but don't have time to play it? Should I be chastised for and blocked from accessing some content? Thank",

Hitman Elusive Targets, I think it's a brilliant idea but it works for Hitman because they think of themselves as it games as a service. Yeah, I don't it's not that I'm forcing you to buy it, it's them encouraging you to keep coming back to it. Yeah, the thing is he's focusing, DocDoomII here, it's focusing more on the exclusive stuff that's day one or like the first week which I can see that being a little sleazy. But going on like, yeah, with the Hitman Elusive Targets, this is great because it's just giving people that have already bought the game even if it is six months down the line. Yeah, reasons to come back, reasons to keep playing. And it also, I would think, encourage people who are on the fence to buy it to buy because they",

Elusive Target, like, should play this. I want to **** kill Gary. And we talk about this a lot where, you know, coming from IGN, like we understand that once a game comes out, it's over, it's done, and it's not talked about anymore. So any reason to get the big sites to, yeah, right, and have to come through the blog roll and get that marketing push. Yeah, it's good for everybody. It's good for the gamers, there's more content. It's good for the publishers and developers because their game's getting marketed again and hopefully more sales and all that stuff.

You're allowed to write in and tell me what exactly Assassin's Creed Origins Trials of the Gods is. But for Hitman, I believe all the Elusive Targets were free. Yeah, so it, well, it's exactly the opposite of what we're talking about with the other things, right? Where it's like, hey, we're encouraging, we're giving you content if you already own the game, but giving you content encouraging you to buy the game rather than nickel and diming. Yeah, I don't think all of them were free. Okay, so remember there was some of those weird DLC stuff and if you buy the collector's edition, you know, yeah, but I don't think it was the Elusive Targets.

Drew writes in, says, I would like to ask you guys about the overall negativity regarding seemingly everything in the games industry and how it seems to stifle any positive conversation. My primary example example is Destiny. The Reddit is overflowing with negative post after negative post. And on the off chance that someone posts something positive, they seem to get attacked by people that post negatively. The majority of time I like to be a part of communities for the games I love, but I'm always afraid to post because I just don't have the time to be negative about this stuff.

Why do we let the negative people suppress us? And I think he might mean suppress us. And he's that feeling of suppression. He didn't mean that ever going to switch to the positive movement outweighing the negative. I just want to be able to share what I love about these games without being downvoted to the point where my comments aren't visible or be attacked because I want to share constant but I don't want to share the constant negative circle jerk that floods most forums communities.

I think the heart of it is it's way easier to be negative about something, 100%, than positive. And I think that you are positively reinforced to be negative about things more than you are to be positive. Grateful what you really got them. Yeah, you know, like of the same way, I can't believe they're nickel and diming us on this. Exactly. Whereas when you're positive, it's way easier to be torn down.

When you like something, you're gonna be its biggest critic. When we watch superhero movies, the first thing I think is what what did I not like about it? Obviously I liked it. Obviously I'm happy that this exists. I enjoyed it. I spent money on it. And I spent two to three hours watching the things, didn't do the credits, and watching the post credit thing. Like what I'm gonna talk about is what how does this rank against the other Marvel movies? How does this compare to this or that? Or I like this and I didn't.
