I'm feeling good today, Greg. Like a good day for video games. You here in this burnt orange, yeah, shirt. Yeah, again, they didn't sponsor this. I'm just saying I used it and now I use it. I got these, now I use it. I got these cool pants. Well, you know what I mean? They sent the trial, I tried it. Oh yeah, cool. When I kept using it, you know. Yeah, you're looking good in this year. Thank you, appreciate it. Play a lot of games as we can. I played a lot of Mario Odyssey. I've been kind of off of Mario Odyssey for a little bit just 'cause I mean, I don't want it to end and I'm looking forward. You're moving in right now, roughly. I'm only at like 350. Okay, cool. Yeah, it's yeah, and uh, because I'm looking at it and I'm like, we don't know what this Switch has coming for us in the next, sure, the next year. Hopefully, January will have a Direct to let us",

Moon gravity, you know. Yeah, but I also felt like I put enough time to do, but this week and I was like, you know what? I'm itching. I need to get back in there. Yeah, I get my new dog fixed, so I played a bit more and man, it's a special game. Have you jump yet? But you know, the dive, mid-air dive. We were talking about this the other day, so I, I'm, I'm a step towards it. Okay, I can't do the chain where I can't just go forever with it. Yeah, but I'm good enough to like, there's some challenges that require, yeah, of course. That's what I was, right? That's what I'm at now. So yeah, I love that.

I can just pop over and do something else and immediately get distracted by a million other things. Yeah, not to go down this rabbit hole too much, but one last thing I want to say, I love Mario Odyssey for so many reasons, but the one that I loved it for the most is how much it makes me want to explore every single level and know every single nook and cranny and move the camera to see if there's anything and collect everything and know the levels inside and out in a way that I haven't felt since Mario 64. No game has ever made me feel like I want to live in the world and understand every aspect of it as much as Odyssey has. And that's it. I never thought I'd have that again.

It's just the fact that yeah, coming back from LA, coming back for her, going to Maryland, playing that game. Like it is like, I love it when I run into a challenge that is super difficult and it's taking me the 30 tries and I can see it's like 45 minutes of just trying to get this goddamn moon and then get out of there. It's awesome. And another thing that I was concerned about as I was playing is like, I wouldn't, I played the main game, it wasn't that challenging, but then post-game is very challenging. I love it. Alright, but just how every life takes ten coins. I was like, oh, what happens when you like get a zero? Yeah, nothing. You just know you hit zero. I have a zero because I've been, I've been",

Most of them pretty straightforward, which I like. Alright, as we settle down from Battlefront microtransaction. First off, let's give a shot to CD Projekt Red. Of course, makers of The Witcher, working on Cyberpunk. Over on Twitter, someone tweeted them and said, \"CD Projekt are considering games as a service for Cyberpunk 2077 as part of their drive to make it more commercially significantly.\" That was in quotes.

Yeah, yeah, like that's, it's awesome too because this talk should get shot. We often say like, you should be nice to people and stuff.

How are you gonna handle all my transactions, loot crates? So yeah, I don't take it as like them taking shots at anyone in particular as much as this movement of like, no, no, **** that.

We're going to continue to be us. This makes me so much more excited for Cyberpunk than I already was just finding out what this game is, which you're absolutely not for me, both from a gameplay perspective and from a perspective. Yeah, it's like the fantasy stuff. Like I just, I'm not drawn to that at all. Right? Yeah, but in the last couple years, like games like Horizon and Zelda, I'm like, you know what? I do like aspects of open-world games, so I'm not totally just gonna be like, no, I'm not gonna play that. Cyberpunk definitely sounds like something up my alley.

This is how you do marketing and PR correctly in the way of the narrative for CD Projekt Red since The Witcher 3, when they really came out on a grand stage, has been, we are, we make games for gamers. We are doing this for art. We are doing this for our community. We're not nickel and diming you. There's a thank you letter in the box when you buy The Witcher 3. The DLC is for, a lot of the DLC is free. Then the expansions that are as big, if not bigger than the original game, are giving you that many hours. It's easy for that.

The other side of that conversation, let's jump over to talk about Battlefront II, not about the actual transactions and stuff that to themselves, but about the fact that it didn't do great in the UK. This is via GamesIndustry.biz. Star Wars Battlefront II's week one boxed sales in the UK were significantly lower than expected. UK retailers told GamesIndustry.biz last month that the new Star Wars game will sell more than Battlefield 1. However, first week sales are more than, are more than 50% down compared with last year's shooter. The boxed sales figures are also down 61% compared with 2015's Star Wars Battlefront.

Article goes on to be talking a little bit about the fact of like, well, this of course doesn't count digital, but there's no way it's making up that number to that extent. Yeah, I mean, so the interesting thing there is you're right, it doesn't count digital and that's as every year goes on, more and more of the pie is taken up by digital sales. But these numbers of the Tom want are retail specific. Yes, so it's down physically compared to physical sales as well. So there is still an apples to apples stay here. Sure. Yeah, the one argument if you wanted to, you know, not that I'm making it, but is the fact that I think digital grows every year, so it's a little bit different, but it is still very much the same. But I mean, still like if they, if UK retailers told him that this was gonna happen, it sure that is last month.

This might not seem like much of a story, but it shows that the heads at Disney might be concerned with the state of Star Wars brand in the hands of EA. It's understandable. The two major games they've published, Battlefront I & II, both released with swirls of controversy. Additionally, Visceral's game sparked its own huge wave of huge controversy with its cancellation and we've barely heard a peep about the state of Respawn's game. Well, they bought them, but sure. Disney could easily be concerned with both the lack of progress that EA has made as well as the damage",

So here are my two questions: Do you think it's at all possible that EA could lose their exclusive deal to publish Star Wars games? And if that's a bit too far, do you think Disney will continue their deal with EA after the 10 years are up? Thanks for everything you do, Jared.\" Very interesting. I, so I'm starting, you kicked around after this IGN's story of, yeah, the CEO of Disney being involved within it. Up until that really came up, I would have been like, no, of course not.

I wonder what is in there and what are the ways Disney could get out of it. I mean, it's interesting. I, my gut tells me that there's no way they're gonna cut it early. That at the very least would have to wait the 10 years. Yeah, 10 years will go by in a **** blink of an eye. Of course, you think about it, they've already started.

I don't really see this being them having any real case to want to back out. I'm sure that there's so much money involved in the, the exclusivity deal that in order to find a loophole to, to back out, they would have to have a real plan going forward. And I don't know what that would look like 'cause I do think that there is power in Disney and Star Wars partnering with an exclusive partner. Yeah, and like, who else would they go to? Bethesda?
