I don't know how to cook a lot of stuff. That's why I love Blue Apron. Jen and I get easy meals we can whip up on a whim, and I get to learn how to make couscous or fish or something else I've never heard of. You sign up, pick your menu, and they deliver pre-portioned ingredients with step-by-step instructions. You just follow along, make the meal, learn something, have a good time. They've even included this handy little flowchart the last time I did it, teaching me how to make sauce from the fond. It's got wines in there. It's like a flowchart, like I said, that it's cool. I'm gonna laminate it again. This isn't something they wrote for me. I'm literally telling you things that are happening in my couch. If you know a good laminator, hit me up.

She felt a little self-conscious that she was not hot enough to be portraying this role. Have you guys ever felt not hot enough? Every day. Of every day. That blows my mind is, I know this sounds like I'm just a dude talking about how hot a woman is, but Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street, that to me is like, it was such an ode to sexuality that I've never seen captured on film. The great actress, too. And it was just mind-blowing where I'm like, in that moment she was the hottest person to ever exist, and that moment lasted for three hours. I wonder if that, I wonder if that moment is gonna be like how people that are like 40, 50 years old when they were kids and they had that moment of like the really hot woman on screen, Julie Christie, in Doctor Zhivago.

Well, yeah, like the cruising where the guys like looking at the girl for the restroom. Past that, for case, is it, is it past time I talked about when they looked at the girls that were naked through the people? No, that's sexual assault. Nobody was looking at a girl through the window and like somebody walks in on him doing that and got him to warn. That was every 80s movie. Yeah, that happened so much. I think Pee-wee Herman. I think of dressed up in a suit. Jesus Christ, what the **** are you talking about? I think a Bourne goozle. I think of Porky's when I think of that, when it was like the first time I ever saw a woman naked on screen was at my, at my next-door neighbor's house.

All the girls go, 'You anything?' I puts his tongue through and they put soap on it. It was a that really shitty, like not even, it was like, like poor soap was not even liquid. It was just like grainy, granular. And I just remember thinking, 'Oh, that's disgusting, but worth it.' Last time, that was the first time I ever saw boobs that weren't my mom's. Oh, you're talking about the famous when she was in the, in the pool, the girl. Yeah, the pool scene. Yes, Phoebe Cates. Who Phoebe Cates was one of those human beings that I looked at and I was like, 'Yes, I am aware that I have a penis now. Thank you for that.' Any hits? Oh, she was so hot. That's good.

We did a topic, at least this might sound like a joke, we were talking about 'Are You Cool?' I was the only one of the famous, 'I'm not cool.' Everyone else said that they're cool. At least I said, 'I have cool moments. I do cool ****.' I wasn't on the show. What a cool thing for cool Tim to say that he's not cool.

Oh, you know, I'd be super down for this. I think about that all the time when I'm not, I'm just not in like a moment that I had. And there's a moment I was telling you about, and didn't you as well? Um, it was during the Let's Play Reunion this weekend where it's like, Tim Gettys, couple years ago, being like, 'We're about to be in front of a lot of cool people. There's, you're gonna have to take your shirt off.' Like, I would've been horrified. But now I, I hit that point of, 'I'm so fat that I'm like, there's not even home.'",

Yeah, I hit that point that I'm like, 'It's all shame, so just roll with it.' It makes you feel so much better telling your head. Doesn't mean I'm gonna say that I'm confident. I'm singing this in a good way. Oh, yeah, like this weekend, I just didn't want to take my shirt off. Neither did I. Yeah, I definitely was like, 'I didn't want to take my shirt off the first day.' And then Barb showed up the second day and I was like, 'Well, I am definitely not taking my shirt off now. That's not happening.' But then I just got to a point, I'm like, 'Why not? Who cares?

I've kind of gotten to a place in my life where I'm like, 'I just can't be bothered to be completely like influenced by all this.' And I also like an influenced influencer, influenced influencer. And I also like made a decision at a young age that I was like, 'Oh man, I really need to try to be funny 'cause I can't wait. I can't, I'm really gonna try to hone this.' Yeah, yeah, you can't only stop yourself having fun because you feel insecure. Yeah, I was wearing a shirt for like 80% of the pool.

Everybody gets **** hot. But eventually I'm just gonna take my wife's like, 'You look perfectly fine. It's most of it's in your hair.' Yeah, 'I'm already a guy. I've already got someone that I might be able to have sex with later. No one else gives a **** about it.' And that's kind of what it boils down to me.

No, the best way to put yourself in a situation that's not ego destroying, having to take your shirt off in a pool you're not confident in front of a bunch of people you think are cool, and the internet watching. There's 10,000 people watching us right now. Oh, yeah, that was, that was a good testament to me, right? Where I was like, 'I looked at everyone in the pool and I'm like, everyone's having fun.' That's the thing. What's cool? Tim's at the party. Yeah, I'd be as nearly as cool. So it's kind of a relief. It's a, yeah, nobody's gonna top that bar.

I want to get in that pool, crap, because lots of shenanigans are happening in that pool. Probably from like the age of like 14 through 20, I like never wore shorts or skirts.

And I felt so self-conscious that I didn't have black hair. I felt so self-conscious that I had hair on my body and they did it. 'You're a hairy man.'

Because oftentimes in, I, I look at my early 20s, my late teens, and I, I didn't really do much to better myself. And that's where a lot of my self-confidence issues came from. It wasn't until I started learning tools like how to work with a camera, how to do After Effects, Premiere, like editing. I'm not from your Final Cut. Back then, how did I? I started investing in myself that I started getting a little bit more confident about going like, 'Yeah, I might not be the tallest guy in the party. I want to have Tim's big fat dick.' But I, but like, but I have these tools that I, that I can start to build off of and build some momentum of my life. And then when I hit around like, you know, when I hit 28, 30, I've met a woman and I was like, 'Oh, I have something to offer you.' Like, 'I have, I'm a confident person 'cause I've invested myself.' That makes sense. But, but",

That makes sense. But, but, but you're right on one level that when you like, life gives you all these things and then you hit 30 and then it starts slowly taking away those things. Were physical, physical. But my thing is, I feel like, like you just started shaking, it's a fact. It's just gonna keep changing and you're always gonna have something you're hung up about. And I know that's gonna be bad things happening because I remember when I was like, what I just said about like, 'Now I'm the right color hair, having too much hair.' Stupid **** that I look at now. I'm like, 'What the ****? That's easy, stupid.' But then there's other things like when I was in high school, I had a lot of acne on my face. And I distinctly remember thinking like, 'I still deal with it. I would do **** anything to not have this.' Like if a genie came, number three",

And I go look at that now and like, my skin is totally fine. And I guess I'll leave it 'cause it's like looking better. Like, 'Well, but it's like now there's totally, if a genie came and I could not exercise and get thin, I would **** do it.' You know, but it's like, it's in 30 years when I look back, there's gonna be some other **** that I would say it's sure. I'm just kind of, kind of keep pushing. Yeah, this, I'll never forget going into Winter Ball in 2006. And Alfredo's mom picked us up in her Odyssey, Toyota Odyssey. Seems like it was amazing. Tell you that. And Odyssey, an Odyssey. And she looking around and she was just tired of us, and I'm like, 'Oh my God, you guys are so'",
