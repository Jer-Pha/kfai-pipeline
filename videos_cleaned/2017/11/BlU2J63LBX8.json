I don't know how to cook a lot of stuff. That's why I love Blue Apron. Jen and I get easy meals we can whip up on a whim, and I get to learn how to make couscous or fish or something else I've never heard of. You sign up, pick your menu, and they deliver pre-portioned ingredients with step-by-step instructions. You just follow along, make the meal, learn something, have a good time. They've even included this handy little flowchart the last time I did it, teaching me how to make sauce from the fond. It's got wines in there. It's like a flowchart, like I said, that it's cool. I'm going to laminate it again. This isn't something they wrote for me. I'm literally telling you things that are happening in my house. If you know a good laminator, hit me up. Check out this week's menu and get $30 off your first meal with free shipping.",

I'm seriously out in the comments below, tell me where to get something laminated. So at least I want to talk to you about Muppets and puppets. Then I sing another song. Yes, the internet knows one thing about you, it's that you love. All right, okay, so mostly my touchstone for the Muppets, not bad, right? I like it, it's Muppet Babies.

I feel like I was... yeah, it was I think I want to say Fozzie the Bear was Chewbacca the Wookiee, and I can't read the other ones. Animal, they'll have to come to me. But I just remember thinking, wow, this is a really, really cool, well-done cartoon. And then I go back and look at some of those older episodes of Muppet Babies, um, The Muppets, and I'm like, what a **** wildly creative thing. Why? And I remember when when Jason Segel and that team was trying to bring The Muppets back and did in fact bring The Muppets back to movies. Oh, I just remember being very happy that I'm like, I'm glad we live in a world where The Muppets are relevant again because they represent to me one of the height of human creativity.",

You're literally just like, you know, and it's a weird thing to say because it's a weird thing to think of like these puppets, these Muppets, these marionettes taking on a life of their own. But like, you think you they just they're just a very special thing. But to me, it's the movies. It was Muppet Treasure Island, Muppet Christmas Carol. Both one. And then my wife really loves Muppet Christmas Carol. We watch that every year. Oh, yeah. Oh, I want to or not, we have to watch it as my sister-in-law loves it as well. You joy scare me in that and I can and my wine my way that was Michael Caine. Oh, yeah. Oh my God, go. Okay, I just can't say that now. Holy shit, it's Michael Caine, man.

Rizzo, you know, he had that kind of New York accent. Like, I was **** good. Well, wow, what brought this on again? Are you a huge Muppet fan? I I do love The Muppets. Like, I mean, I've always been kind of into The Muppets specifically. I like other forms like claymation and stop-motion. If there's just something to me always about The Muppets that just maybe just because of how genuine it is and how the comedy was always it was never malicious, no, in a way. And I mean, puns especially, like The Muppets are if you watch the old Muppet Show or even Muppets Tonight, that's that's all that was.

Like when they first, you know, kind of a were a thing, it was like SNL. Muppets were on it, no, that's right. Jim Henson was making Muppets for that. That's right. And everyone hated that. I hated working with them. Let's have Muppets in primetime. That was the thought, like for a mature audience. And and so I don't want to get into like the whole history because it was like a British show. Let's go deep. But that's what the show is all about. But the teaching-learning is carrying the the Muppet Show. I guess I guess was perceived to fail, but it was like a raging success and was supposed to be for a more mature audience. But it was weird 'cause it came out with this more like targeted toward children feel, especially like post Muppet Show and all the movies. And that's kind of my relationship with The Muppets.

But maybe some of the variety show us, but more of the like, here's a group of characters that they're they there's a certain spirit to them and there's a certain element of heart and sincerity and humor without being malicious, humor without being just doom and gloom. With The Muppets, it's always like, how can they revisit it? How could they reunite? How can they save something so fun? Yeah, it's a rainbow song. First dance to my wedding that James' idea was to Rainbow Connection. Do that. And it was he was like, it was his idea. He's like, we should do like Rainbow Connection. And I was like, no, you don't have to do that. He was pretty sweet. But yeah, to me, The Muppets are just this like beacon and bastion of of light and like goodness, boy.

And for me, it's it's very nostalgic, right? Yeah, because that's my childhood. But I also I'm I'm I get more and more nostalgic the older I get because as everything goes more and more toward really photorealistic CG, it's still missing that level of live performance that I think The Muppets nailed, right? Yeah, they're puppets, but there's also there are tangible things that are really there. You're getting the performance directly from The Muppets' mouths, right? Which is the performer right underneath them. And so there's something special about that. And we saw it with The Force Awakens where J.J. Abrams purposely wanted to go back to that style of filmmaking because there's just something that you can connect with even though they're inanimate objects and then we clearly made of cloth because you can tell the texture, you connect with that",

Yeah, it's funny because like even even with Star Wars, I love Star Wars so much, but there's something about the look of the the characters and even if it's like the costumes and stuff, well, it's like there's still something impractical about seeing aliens and their mouths aren't moving when they're talking because they are just these costumes, right? But then there's something about The Muppets and about owning any type of puppet, Sesame Street, any of that thing, any Jim Henson thing where it's like they feel real because they obviously don't look like they're perfectly humanoid, right? Whatever it is, like they're supposed to be a cloth frog, right? And it's like watching it, it's it's funny because there's not too",

And it's like watching it, it's it's funny because there's not too many examples of like animation in live-action things in the sense of like Space Jam or Who Framed Roger Rabbit or things like that. But those movies work so well, especially Who Framed Roger Rabbit because the every shot that every animated shot was lit as if it was in real life. So you know, felt like you there the live-action actors were interacting with real. And yeah, even though it's a fun cartoon, it's obviously fake, but there are moments that that that you you stop believing that because you're just watching. He's like, oh, I totally buy it. And I think that The Muppets has this magic where even from the beginning, you don't really look at it and go, oh, he's talking to a puppet. It's like, oh, that's a character. But they're they're actually going back and forth and there's comedy in the motion. It's like",

I think that's what's important is that it's not just the mouth is moving and it's lip-synced, but it's like just the way the characters like this performance is actual performance. And you'd be like, if you look into like puppetry and like skill and technique, just the way that you can like Kermit's face, how you can emote with it in such simple ways, make it make him look like he's sad by turning his face down. His eyes don't change, I think, but it's just the the angle. Like it's almost crunches in a different way. I just like the techniques that Jim Henson was pioneering are crazy. Getting them to ride bikes. And if you go and you look at, I was always weird when you saw Kermit's feet always. I was like, don't do that anymore. That's a long fear. Like like shame.

I loved it because that was part of the the endearing quality of it was that they were always like at the bottom half of every frame. So I'd be like Steve Martin and Kermit had to be like down here. Yeah, so I always get in fights with my friends about The Muppets experience at Disneyland. I love it because it's this we are in a playroom and then there was like there's a theater screen happening. It's gone. I know it's gone. I know it's gone.

But you can go watch this video of the intended plans they had for doing a Muppets world at Disneyland. And it was in the works with Jim Henson and like Disney before Jim Henson died. And then after he died, they kind of just lost interest. Yeah, well, I think at that point too, that it had kind of worn off. Like, yeah, they weren't as well-known. The blueprints for that, what that Muppets land would have been are incredible. There's like they're right. There was an idea for a restaurant where like a animatronic rats would be bringing new food and they would stage different actual cool events like a kitchen fire where a Swedish Chef would run out and be like, and like all this interactive that it was heartbreaking that I don't forget",

It talking about what they replace it with Marvel things that to be fair are pretty freaking cool. Ended trailers for whatever Marvel movies coming out, right? Be like a 3D experience. But like they blow that. The same thing with the Star Wars or they're not doing that Star Wars thing that took over Captain EO. What's next on the docket for Muppets? Is there anything? Well, they just canceled the show, right? Didn't feel like the spirit was that the brain just they just Frank and not Frank Oz, but someone's not doing the voice anymore, right? Yeah, Steve Whitmire.

That's a great like if you're looking for something, no, it's just going to hit you heartstrings and the way that they they train their replacements, these Muppeteers, like decades.

They never never over the space shuttle having like it's it's it's a really weird info. He would have just blown out. I don't know, man. Anyway, no, there's no ride. I got Disneyland.

And if he's getting old, so we're going to stand by the way he has to do Big Bird like this. Yeah, yeah. So he has to have his hand up like this the entire time just fits the neck. Yeah, and it is it looks like torture. It looks terrible. There are a lot of like puppets and puppets that use what all those for, which is like animatronic or robot controlled. Mm-hmm.
