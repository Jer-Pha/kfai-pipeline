Guess I think Depp is playing murder victim on Murder on the Orient Express. She hates Johnny Depp. I do hate you. This is a lost cause so I'm never gonna watch it. What era Johnny Depp do you hate? No, she hates him now 'cause he's also a piece of ****. He's like abused people. The only Johnny Depp tonight things like really is like Edward Scissorhands. Johnny, have you ever seen Benny & Joon?
