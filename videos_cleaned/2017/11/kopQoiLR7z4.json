What's up, guys? Welcome back to Party Mode. I'm Tim Gettys, this is Nick Scarpino, that is Andy Cortez. And Nick, what is this? This is our new series within a series. Well, like I'm, I like to call Scary Sundays. That's what I'm telling you. But this show comes out on Wednesdays. Nick, everyone's saying you can get it early on Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames. Now, Lilly, Andy, a week early, early. What's up, baby? The thing about Tim, I'm hooked. I try to start these sub-brands. You know how they have Knott's Berry Farm and then when it's Halloween time, it's Knott's Scary Farm. We're doing a special Horror Night series, right? He said I wanted to call Spooky Sundays on Wednesdays. People don't know that we're not recording this on a Sunday because just call this Spooky Sunday.",

Do I need to know anything about Five Nights at Freddy's? Here's the thing, let's, before I even get into this, Tim, do any of us have experience of this? Zero experience. As you've seen a couple let's play. Here is the only experience I have with this is that there was a movie that called Freddy Got Fingered. Yes, that I did see. And during it, Oscar-winner, awesome, can he be that here? During it, Tom Green goes, \"Daddy, would you like some sausage? Daddy, would you like some sauce?\" That won the Emmy for Best Dungeon. It did. It was really good. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, family pizzeria, looking for security guard to work the night shift, 1 A.M. to 6 A.M. I can read the rest of the system.

Don't waste your power 'cause it's gonna, wait, how are you even, what the fuck? The animatronic characters here do get a bit wonky at night. But drive away. Know if I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for 20 years, I'd never go back to first time.
