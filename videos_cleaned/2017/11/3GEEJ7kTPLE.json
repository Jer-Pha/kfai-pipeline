What people think is course some a, but but shouldn't you give me a look at 30? Not if you get. Okay, that's that's true. I'm a passionate person. I mean, I think really you shouldn't. Did I think you shouldn't? I shouldn't give a fuck. You should. Difference between like being a nuisance to society and being you. You know, if you're just being you, then you know, be you. You know, this is a dated reference. I don't expect anybody but Nick to get, but Cool Greg's like the Eddie Haskell of like society. You're up to shenanigans, you scamp. Get out of here. Don't do it. Yeah, what about like tailgate drinking? Are you thinking something that is? I don't know. Yeah, yeah, you take them, you get drunk. Like there's not a tailgating culture here at the studio. Stadium all the way. No, but yeah, Santa Clara sucks. That was a stupid move. 49ers in the way of progress. Park at that old thing, but I never fucking went.",

Is that a thing that adults do? Oh, yes, it is. Is it weird to like, yeah, your how would you 34? Yeah, and you still go to Mizzou football games? Yeah, that seems weird to me. Really seems weird like to rage at a Mizzou football game. But you raged the way you rage as a 34 year old with all your friends have fucking children like a week ago, not in Mizzou football game. That's what I'm saying. So like, is it weird to do that? It's like go fuck hard at a tailgate. I feel like excessive drinking above the age of 30. I I like some up like, I don't know, you think you might ask me. I do think I'm better than, you know, not every weekend. The thing about football tailgates, right? Especially my body can't",

So it's different than if I was there every Saturday at blackout drunk. Okay, but even that, it's like you're getting drunk, but you're getting drunk the way a 34 year old gets when hey, Poe came down to party. He brought his son. Like we're not like do a paint can, Little Jack, you know, that meal an hour. It's a different kind.

It's not so much about who fuck cares by the game. You know what I mean? At that point, it's fair at all. But also, I do wonder about like a small town like camp. I haven't been back in years. My parents always come to visit me because they want to go shopping and stuff like that. So I haven't gone back, but I do wonder like their high school football games 'cause that's like basically all there is. They're like, how rowdy those actually gay?

That's weird 'cause I didn't grow up in that culture and that's not at all what it was for us in the suburbs. Yeah, it was like a big deal. Oh, yeah. Friday nights was always gonna be weird to me. That's always gonna be weird. Like any any time parents are living vicariously for their children's high school career. That's always gonna just be like, that's weird to me. Not done. Yeah, mostly 'cause my mom was completely disinterested in anything I did past the age of like 10. Your third, you probably shouldn't eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. That's stupid.
