Tyrese Gibson threatens to quit Furious franchise if Dwayne Johnson is in Fast 9. I'm gonna read this whole story first, okay? And then we're gonna proceed to tell Tyrese this is a really bad move, okay? Yeah, this is from Luke Riley over IGN. An actor, a music artist, Tyrese Tyrese is clashed with Fast and Furious franchise co-star. The co-star's an interesting way to put that. I would say probably start at this point. Dwayne Johnson continues with Gibson declaring today, this was yesterday, that he would back out of a series of Johnson returned for Fast 9. Gibson made his announcement via spontaneous Instagram account riding, quote, \"I'm sorry to announce that if Dwayne is in Fast 9, there will be no more Roman Pearce.\"",

Gibson made his announcement via spontaneous Instagram account riding, quote, \"I'm sorry to announce that if Dwayne is in Fast 9, there will be no more Roman Pearce.\" Gibson proceeded to refer to Johnson as a clown and a selfish champ. Gibson's anger at Johnson is linked to the upcoming Fast and Furious spin-off in the pipeline for Johnson and Jason Statham, due to hit franchises, excuse me, theaters July 26, 2019. In previous Instagram posts, Gibson admitted that he was, quote, \"was just mad that Johnson was pitched an idea privately and said yes without thinking of what I'm dealing with personally.\" Gibson is currently locked in a court battle with his ex-wife concerning the pair's ten-year-old daughter, which according to Gibson, has left him almost broke, quote, \"All I ask you to do is do privately was not accept a role that would deeply affect all of us,\" wrote Gibson.

Originally slated to arrive in 2019, Fast & Furious 9 was officially pushed back to 2020 to make space for the Johnson/Statham spin-off. Gibson immediately blames Johnson for the delay, though serious stalwart Vin Diesel responded to the chatter insisting that it was unfair to blame anyone, anybody, for the next film in the hugely popular franchise being postponed for a year. Of course, last month, Diesel strongly hinted that director Justin Lin will be returning to the franchise. He's not your fucking provider, dude. Why, like, why are you acting as if like he is your mom that were supposed to take care of you? You got a kid and then left you. Story wise, if you're asking me, do I want Hobbs or Roman Pearce? I don't like to pick between these two, but I will pick Hobbs. Or how to 100% understand, 1,000% okay? Like, I don't know The Rock personally, but I'd like to believe we're friends.",

He's given me a private message as when he said the boys, he was talking about, yeah, me too. It's pretty now. And I thought it was about me. It was mostly me. Long story short, I don't think this is a great move for Tyrese and his career because I feel like when I think Tyrese, the only thing I can think that he's been in in the last 10 years is Fast and Furious. I don't I can't name another movie or I one of his songs. I don't know, you know what, anything about fucking bring back Ja Rule, dude. Yeah, hashtag Bring Back Ja Rule. You know why?

I sympathize it and on a personal note, I seriously note, I can understand that what Tyrese is going through right now is probably very or yeah, it's hard. Fighting over custody of a child is very, very difficult. I'm saying that he's an elevated state of probably in tension right now, an anxiety and an anger. I get that he's probably speaking from the wrong place, but taking all the emotion out of the situation, this is just not the way to conduct yourself, right? And and saying to another actor, \"Hey, you can't do a movie because you're taking like you're delaying me being able to do a movie,\" is not the right way to do it.

Well, also, he shouldn't be living fucking movie the movie, dude. Well, the other thing of note is, weren't Fast and Furious 9 and 10? This franchise needs new things to come to it if it's going to continue. And we can all agree here, we want to go to Fast 10, right? We want another 10 films.
