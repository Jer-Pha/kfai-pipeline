I didn't find. I feel like this might be a job for Cool Greg. It does seem like it out there. We're only here two days, you know, sometimes can pie. Oh, they're furiously working back there, which means either the stream's not working, the audio is not working, or both aren't working. Let's check the chat and see if there's garbage talk on firing now. Tim's mic is off. This is what it is. Is that what it is? That's what they're saying. A little bit of this, column A, column B, pumpkin pie. The thing is, at this point, well, I don't ever want this show to be perfect. No, at first I did, but now I'm just kind of like, I'm happy that I'm not the worst part of the show. And then what happened when we came back from that, when when we came back from internet on Friday, and then the audio was gone, there was no audio, and you're like, I don't know what",

I don't want to focus on the dogs, the ongoing problems that we always have, 'cause guess what? We're in production, where it was gonna happen from that, was gonna be something, an update that needs to happen, a camera that falls down, Tim needs a powder on his face, or whatever. Is that is not all I'm saying is this, it's Thanksgiving Week, it is, okay? Which means, look, the better at a certain going on this week, spoiler is probably Friday, I'm gonna have pumpkin pie for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Yeah, you are fantastic.

I also have just so badly gone off my diet that I feel terrible about myself. On Friday, I was a little ill. I had to, I had to call Yousef and be like, hey man, I'm sorry, I can't go Morrigan right now. I feel like crap. Went home, slept for like 14 hours, woke up, ate like I used to in college all day. Yeah, we're talking burrito. Maybe I'll get another burrito, right? I have Oreo cookies for no reason. Haha. Sunday, woke up, I'm like, I feel way better. It's still gonna eat like an ass though.

We watched a lot of stuff. I want to get to that later. I'm glad to be kind of our deep dive topic. Greg wants to come in and talk to us about what he watched. I watched some fun stuff over the weekend. Cool. Before we do that, I'm giving everyone the glockenspiel.

Yeah, marks the lowest American North American opening of the five titles in the DC Extended Universe. And it's a major setback following the breakout success of the summer's critical hit Wonder Woman. And it's the lowest domestic launch of any DC superhero movie since the ill-fated Green Lantern in 2011, which opened $53. million. The biggest sign of Justice League was in trouble was when Zack Snyder turned over the directing duties. Yadda yadda yadda. DC, I just wanted to go into some of the other.

The two films largely shunned by critics were directed by Snyder, who had been given dominion over the direction of DCEU. And a majority of critics did not embrace The Suicide Squad, which debuted at $133.7 million in August 2016, five months after Dawn of Justice. No, Dawn of Justice, nor did Justice League earn good reviews. So these are not critically acclaimed movies, and now it seems like they're sliding downward in the box office.

Do we power through? I mean, they say, hey, you know, it's not that bad. Let's push through. The big rumor, right, is those readings. I obviously watch this stuff. I mean, I'm in my Fortress of Solitude all weekend reading every Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Justice League story I get my hands on. Yeah, and the argument is of the fact that it's really All Quiet on the Western Front right now, other than Aquaman. Aquaman's the other only other movie that's really like in the Shazam!

Tarantino's upcoming live, according to source who read the script, focuses on a male TV actor who's had one hit series and is looking for a way to get into the film business. His sidekick, who's also a stunt double, is looking for the same thing. The horrific murder of Sharon Tate and the four of her friends by Charles Manson's cult followers serves as a backdrop to the main story. So it's just it's not about that.
