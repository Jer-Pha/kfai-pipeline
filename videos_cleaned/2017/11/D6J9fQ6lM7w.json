How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? Good. You ready to talk about some video game? I am. Haven't talked about video games for a while. Yeah, you're real rusty. You know, I got like a week and a half out. That's no good. Don't do that. You can't live that life. Did you play anything over break? I played a lot more Mario Odyssey. I think that's it. I don't know that I know I didn't get a no, no, be very behind. Yeah, I mean, Tim and Nick can only hold yours. Also, has left you behind for sure.

It went up during break, and I don't think enough people saw it. So that's it going out of my way.

I will be able to tell you about them at some point, hopefully the next couple days. You expect it for sure though. I can tell you Sunday is our fertility meet-and-greet in Buena Park.

I've thought about it many times as you've done it, but I never want to interrupt you when you're in your flow. But right now I had a good moment, so I'm going to interject. You say that the people need to keep us honest and go to KindaFunny.com/You'reWrong, so it can be a more polished podcast for the YouTube and audio listeners.

Quick thing. I, I don't actually mean it. The kids, they just want me to mix it up sometimes. So I got, I gotta go with something else next. Number one on the Roper Report, PUBG is apparently going mobile. This is via Polygon. Why not a mobile version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is in development. Tencent announced this week the mega publisher is working with developer Bluehole to port the Windows PC hit to smartphones for Chinese audiences. Tencent promises a similar PUBG experience on mobile as on PC, although it remains to be seen how the company will translate the shooter to a smaller screen. Parentheses, there are plenty of Battle Royale style games already on mobile that may give fans",

Parentheses, there are plenty of Battle Royale style games already on mobile that may give fans an idea of what to expect, at least in parentheses. The game is currently planned to launch in China first, although Tencent neither gave the release date nor detailed plans to expand to its other markets. But as the company pointed out in its Chinese language press release, PUBG has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. So we'd expect a Western release at some point. How you feel about that one, Tim? Man, this is Tencent, Tencent, Tencent. I don't know, is it? That's, I heard it pronounced. I'm fairly. It just, it's interesting because as somebody from America that understands American companies to an extent, and even how America deals with like Japanese companies with video games and all that, it's China is something that you rarely hear about. I think it's because a lot of times they don't play",

So they have to have their own kind of systems and social, social sharing and all that stuff. Tencent apparently grown over there, and I hadn't heard anything about it. Then sounds like, oh, they own Riot Games. Yeah, they got stakes in a holding station in Activision Blizzard. And we want to say Epic Games. Kind of fun that you're, well, they do. And it's like when you add all that upside, holy ****, that's huge. And then they're just only Riot alone. That's really crazy. And then for them to be with now PUBG, this game that is selling gangbusters day after day, like not slowing down at all, bringing it to mobile platform that has so many available units out there.

Like why, I don't think that people is seeing the show are going to be affected in a way that they're not gonna play it. They're not like this, this doesn't matter to these people. I don't think. You do think so? No, you only when this comes, PUBG on mobile, people are gonna play it. Mmm, namely no ****. I think PUBG, I mean, if people can't play simple platformers on their phone without complaining, they're not gonna be able to play a proper mouse and keyboard game without complaining. Sure.

When the time of these other Battle Royale games taking something like PUBG, an IP that people understand what that is, and mobile-ifying it, I think it's great for the people that want those games, and more power to them. But I think it's gonna make a ton of money, and I think it's gonna be super successful for Tencent. But I just think that this is like, so we always talk about the industry as it is, and then there's all these weird splinters we don't really know about because it's not our, not our, what's our neck of the woods, not our ecosystem. No, yeah, and I think that this, this is just an example of mobile games, and like esports is one of those branches, right? And then it's",

And then there's things like mobile games that millions of people are playing and millions of people are paying for, but not us. So here's my thought. Um, this one is that I see, I understand what you're saying, and I think in a traditional sense, you're correct. I think the PUBG license in name, fact that Bluehole's involved in that, you know, Brendan Greene left something to say when they put this out. I feel this could be the game that converts 1% or whatever, 0.05% of PUBG players to actually stick around and play it. I think when it comes out, it will be, oh, ****. Like, I mean, look at Animal Crossing, right? Animal Crossing on mobile, all like, you know, Hamza put out a great tweet today. It was like, Hamza, you're playing that Animal",

Like, it, we're all playing it. Not all, you're not, but like a lot of us in this room are playing that game and enjoying it, even though it's just task management. It's not like a real Animal Crossing in quotes. I feel like this is the same thing where curiosity is gonna get you if it's a free-to-play PUBG on mobile that comes out. Yeah, it's not gonna be PUBG that you know from the PC or that you know from the Xbox One, or it's gonna be a modified, boil down, whatever you want to call it, not really pink, but a different version of PUBG. But I think there's a chance enough I'm gonna download to see what I feel like Animal Crossing isn't an apt comparison here. I think",

I think it's more similar to Super Mario Run situation where it's like there's an IP that you know and love, and everyone understands what that means. Let's again, mobile-ify it. Yeah, and take that idea and make it work with using touchscreens and all that. And it didn't work to the extent that the one on time out the people listening wanted to. And I think this is an example that will go down that route. Animal Crossing is a totally different beast. Animal Crossing is, it's a time waster, you know, it's not a video game in the traditional sense. Sure. My thought process would be, I don't see it being, I don't think PUBG at the moment has the cachet, the nostalgia, the history that Mario has, that you know what a Mario is supposed to play like, supposed to feel like.

There are actually lots of misunderstandings here, he says. This is him talking about the person they clarifies, like, why didn't I put in the intro here? Let me try again. There are actually lots of misunderstandings here, he says, on the perception that the firm's Western games are struggling. First of all, Tomb Raider is a very important title and very important piece of IP for us and nothing has changed about that. The fiscal year prior to the one where I became president in 2013 was one where overall our earning numbers were not very good. It was immediately before the end of the fiscal year in March that Tomb Raider came out, so we had very high",

Looking back on that now, I think the target we set for ourselves was extremely high. I say this with the benefit of hindsight now, but at the time our numbers leading up to the release of Tomb Raider had been very poor and I think our people were probably banking on that and wondering how much it was going to help our final earnings. In the end, it didn't quite sell as much as we anticipated. Matsuda, and this back to GamesIndustry.biz, Ms. Croft's reboot adventures have certainly delivered strong sales since today. The 2013 Tomb Raider has sold more than 11 million units worldwide. The 2015 sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider, has shifted nearly 7 million units.

What I can say is that I, what I can say is Eidos Montreal has always developed Deus Ex, and the issue is we do not have limitless resources. We have several big titles that we work with and that's partly a factor in what our lineup looks like. Of course, it would be ideal if we could work on all of them all the time, but the fact of the matter is some titles have to wait their turn. There it is.

They have so much behind them that PlayStation is worried about **** it up. The wild card is Xbox. Is when does Xbox want to come out? Do they want to be out before everybody? Do they want to wait and see? Do they want to see if they can make up ground with Xbox One X? Like what is there? I don't know what their, as I said on multiple shows, this about Xbox One and Xbox One X and Microsoft and Xbox. I don't understand what their vision is anymore. I think it is all driven by software. When we look at how long this console generation has been so far and how long it could keep going compared to last generation, debate the generations before that.
