How they can shove it up their ass. Everybody wake up Guinness World Records, we got one set, we got one. Yahoo's gonna be Tim. How the hell are you? I am very, very... What are you gonna play this fine weekend? I cannot wait for this weekend to play some games. Jen, I'm not talking to you all week long or weekend long, just playing games. Yeah, I want to play a bit of the Battlefront multiplayer because I didn't really get to jump into that. Out boilers, that's gonna be in the news. Yeah, oh really? From your thoughts and impressions, come on. Yeah, I want to play a bit more of that and then obviously, you know, a little bit more of that Mario.

Anyways, Oskar, maybe just Oscar says, \"As we approach the worldwide launch, it's clear that many of you feel there are still challenges in the design. We've heard the concerns about potentially giving players unfair advantages and we've heard that this is overshadowing an otherwise great game. This was never our intention. Sorry we didn't get this right. We hear you loud and clear, so we're turning off all in-game purchases. We will now spend more time listening, adjusting, balancing, and tuning.

Oskar Gabrielson, general manager at DICE. Tim, thoughts? I think that this is a very complicated, layered situation. The end of it is a very onion-like situation and ordeal. At the end of the day, great. This is awesome. They've listened. Where the problems and layers come in is the bullying aspects and the death threats and this and that.

At the end of the day, awesome. Star Wars Battlefront II should have the the best chance it has to succeed and all this. They got it wrong. They effed it up and they are admitting they effed it up.

I'm gonna toss it to Josh, who wrote into Kinda Funny Games Daily, who piggybacks off of what you said, Tim. \"Hey, Greg and Tim, so as most everyone is celebrating the removal of real money purchases in Battlefront II, I find myself more cautiously concerned. Are we now in an age where you stir up big stink about something a company will cave? We already saw this with the ending for Mass Effect 3 and EA caved there. I've already seen this invigorating people to rouse other people to their internet mob to push for change in other games. I'm a firm believer in capitalism and people voting with their wallet and companies making monetary changes based on a monetary figure of sales and the such. I guess I'm just concerned that this is inspiring people to continue these attack tactics on devs and publishers to...",

Thoughts?\" Josh, here's my take on it because I've seen this kicked around a lot. Any of like, \"Oh, great, congratulations, that bullies, you've won. You've gotten what you wanted.\" Bubble-wah. Internet tough guys, internet bullies will exist for the rest of the internet and will exist for every decision made. And I understand that for them, this is... they think they did it with their death threats.

I think there's a trade-off here. And I don't think everyone at large is gonna believe that it was the bad guys that made this happen. This is a win in terms of, hey, discourse in gaming does matter. And the fact that if we get out there and something appears to be wrong that much, that's the one thing I still have with this is that all the facts I've heard and read and everything else about it sounds like this was a shitty ass system and a stupid idea.

Clearly it was wrong. I wish you could have gotten into live hands and to the actual community that wants to play it more than anybody and seen if it mattered. Now, I'm not saying that in early access and all this stuff, people who are the hardest of the hardcore weren't playing and saying there was a problem. All that doesn't matter. This came out.

Mass Effect 3's ending doesn't change because of the people who were being rude to the writers and stuff online. It changes because the hardest of the hardcore Mass Effect fans who had been there for the better part of a decade were like, \"This is not a great ending. This is not what we were going for.\" Mm-hmm. That's what I take. Yeah, I think it's all factors playing into it at once.

Great. Let's move toward a better future where next fall we're not gonna have this microtransaction problem to this extent. Hopefully this will be like, let's shine all the way back to the other extreme and baby step, baby step, baby step. And then there'll be someone else that gets punched out for going too far.

Reuters says acquisition of much, I've never even heard of right there, taking acquisition and putting the 'eve' on their acquisition, that positive acquisitive, whatever. French media conglomerate Vivendi missed analysts estimates in third quarter earnings and ruled out a hostile takeover of Ubisoft for the next six months after the video games maker beat forecasts, pushing its shares to record high.

South Park and Assassin's Creed Origins are both forty two dollars, which is a pretty good deal. However, most retailers are offering these two games for thirty to thirty five dollars on Black Friday. This brings me to my question/comment. I really don't understand why you guys are convinced two games will be considerably cheaper when we move to the inevitable all digital future. First, there's the microtransaction-a-palooza of 2017 has shown that devs may be looking for ways to raise prices as opposed to lowering them. Second, I always wait to buy games physically when they're always at least ten or twenty dollars cheaper. I'm the digital version that plus early adopter discounts",

That plus early adopter discounts from Best Buy/Amazon make physical copies cheaper than digital. So how is it gonna happen where it's gonna be cheaper? XOXO Eric. The problem we have and what we're talking about, Eric, of digital only being one day cheaper is the fact that you're talking about shopping at brick-and-mortar. You're talking about shopping at Amazon and Best Buy and GameStop. It's the fact that they still exist in the form that they do. It's the same thing we talk about with Vita games all the time where when Vita games originally came out, now regular games that are out and then digital, the same thing as they go into a store. You can't undercut the stores yet because if you were to go in there, be like, \"Alright, cool. Everything on PSN at, you know, it's $60 in Walmart, but it's $50 on PSN on launch day,\" you would",

They would stop selling your consoles and then or stop carrying your games and start favoring Xbox or PlayStation or whoever the one who pissed them off is, right? The idea here that all digital one day or the digital landscape winning out in the end will be better for gamers is all referenced by Steam in the way that Steam, if you look at that, right? They have no competitors there. People really aren't selling physical PC games anymore. So you get games out on there, you get them in bundles, you get them at these crazy discounts. People can put up a flash sale really quick, put them down really quick, do whatever the hell they want to do to make Steam be the premier platform for people to go to.

I don't know this thing as, I guess, I don't even when Amazon having a digital marketplace, I don't know how much they really factor into it because they don't have to worry about, \"Hey, we're not gonna sell your thing here.\" The argument here is the fact that you cut out the middleman, you cut off the stores, you cut out the trucks. Games should come down in price and just be easier to sell. You're wrong. I mean, I think it's complicated because, you know, we've hit the, we've talked about it so often where it comes down to that we can't have a digital only presence because we don't have the infrastructure for that yet, America, and all that stuff.

You can, I can, but I've bought my digital codes there and everything else. But it's like, it's not where it's at with Amazon's music side, for example, right? Where for a long time iTunes was the only way and then Amazon slowly over time figured it out working with deals with different record labels. They they're now huge and a lot of people buy their music digitally on Amazon. Yeah, and that took time, you know. It wasn't always the digital sold more than physical for music.

So I don't know in terms of the cost of the games, I don't think that we'll really ever see the price of games go down just because it's cutting out the the middleman of the the storefronts and and all that stuff. Well, the argument would be not just the fact of the middleman, all the stuff. It's the argument that we set this and some people have toyed with it so far, but I think we set this arbitrary games cost $60.

When Ratchet & Clank came out for PlayStation 4 and, well, you're like, \"Oh, it's 40 bucks. This ain't a real Ratchet & Clank game.\" And you played it and it wasn't real original in the game.

Yeah, I feel like they're they have that, there's been a lot of games that explore the the scale a bit more. Even see with like Crash, like the Ratchet going into it. Yeah, a lot of people like, \"Oh, this is a movie tie-in.\" Sure, right? So there was a lot of other factors going into that. The game still sold very well and it was critically acclaimed. Yeah, and then Crash Bandicoot being another example, $40. And it was one of the bestsellers of the year. And there's a bunch of other ones too.

Wouldn't you people start playing with the models and doing this, bringing in free-to-play, putting out a discounted game?
