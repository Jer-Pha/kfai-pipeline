I'm excited about this. And then Nick bringing in a big hug. Come on, group hug around Pete. How are my friends? We're great. How are you? Good to see you, man. Good to see you. You brought Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. I did. I'm very excited for this game. Gave it one of my E3 nods of the show or whatever the hell we call. Very pleased and honored to have received. Well, I played, you know, we got you, you brought in the demo here. Reunion is what played there where I re more or L you roll around in a wheelchair, Nick, and pick up guns and just shoot people from a wheelchair. It's awesome. Yeah, but I'm excited to start something new, so I'm going to jump into Roswell now. Of course, I haven't, I haven't, you know, I haven't practiced.

By the way, great press conference. What I liked the most was the trailer for immediately established like, oh, I I'm in like this is this is a character ensemble piece.

BJ and his body being broken from the events of the first game is now using that same kind of suit to allow him to be able to move around because otherwise he's basically in a wheelchair. Sure. And that's good for a level, but not for an entire game, right? Yeah, I want what's her name? Now there's a tunnel that's accessible through Spess' Hideout straight into the Nazi top. Sorry, put. Yeah, thanks. Glad we have that recorded. Everyone knows for a long. Everybody's for years said that Pete Hines' fake gamer, fake gamer guy, fake gamer boy. Look it up.

Going to be here. Would it be on? I think it just Grace. Grace something secret base talking about was constructed by Kevin's looking it up. What's her name? One of the lady he comes with super. But it Grace, it existed for a thousand years long before America got. I love it. Goity. Now Nick's phone is still opening up from the load screen. I'm just trying to spell Wolfenstein correctly.

So whatever it is is so important that the whole upper echelon of the Nazi leadership left Berlin shop in New Mexico. This is what you need this for.

Uh but this is the first game MachineGames guys have ever gotten to work on a sequel to something they made. Oh, wow, really? Okay. And so one of the things they talked about was like the chance to actually like instead of trying to figure out what the game is, they get to sort of explore and build on what the game is. So they're not having to figure out like, well, how does dialogue work or how do characters talk? They've already sort of figured that out. Like they know who Anya is.
