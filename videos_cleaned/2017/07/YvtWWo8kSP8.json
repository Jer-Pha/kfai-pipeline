You can play on Friday the 13th in honor of Thursday the 13th. Oh no, I wish. Did you put, did you put a Throwback Thursday picture out on Twitter yet? I don't do that usually. I'm thinking about doing it, but I'm thinking about taking a picture every Thursday and just tweeting out that picture from last Thursday. Yeah, today, here's what I'll say: Nick Scarpino, your social media game has been killing it lately. I feel like you, you were on the bench for a long time and we all like, if you wanted to come off the bench, you'd be like a Charles Barkley, you know, a David Robinson out there. And it's one of those things, you finally came off the bench and you've been **** slaying as the kids say. They slay, right? Cool, Greg. That's what the kids say. They do that.

If you're going to put my Instagram posts in one category, cool, Greg, would they be Juiced or Sauced? Sa-Sauced. All right, I like that. Which one did we decide what was the difference between juice and sauce again? Sauce is like more, you can't lose the juice. Is that what it was? You can't squeeze the juice. You can't lose the sauce because the sauce, yeah, 'cause juice goes bad, but sauce, like hot sauce, can stay in your refrigerator a long time. Barbecue sauce will stay there for years, but juice will spoil. Juice will eventually go bad. That was what we decided. Speaking, Greg, great.
