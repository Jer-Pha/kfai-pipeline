Hello, Mr. Miller. Oh, how are you? You know, I'm just starting to recover from being gone on my trip and then I went right back into doing this show and then I went straight to Comic-Con and now I'm back and the girls that are here tomorrow. I was there all weekend, actually. I got there on Thursday. We high-fived in the sky and as you were on your way back, one of those, I think I saw you tweeting about being like there and I was like, she just landed on the Virgin America flight that I'm boarding because it was one of those like, I never looked up. I was just turning on myself. Yeah, yeah, but it was great. The panel for Life is Strange: Before the Storm went really fantastically with a live playthrough all of a scene, which is really fun. And then I guess hosted on Marvel Games and I believe that episode's going out",

I think what we talked about what they were showing at the conference and I got the chance to play Marvel Powers United VR. Very nice. Yes, yes, I did. I host the Marvel Games panel and that was one of the ones we were talking about. It's funny, when we went to do the Lone Echo or Echo Arena, let's play, they'll go up as a party mode, I think next week, walking in there and seeing Allie and then it was Sanzaru doing their Sanzaru and I'm like, \"Aw man, the Sly Cooper guys.\" Like, I haven't, and Matt Kramer was on the panel. It doesn't look like I haven't seen him in years. It was great. What did you think? I thought it was really fun. Yeah, yeah.

And then my big question, Life is Strange: Before the Storm looking good? It looks excellent. You know, I'm a big fan. I don't want to screw it up. Was jarring not having Ashley's voice as Chloe? No, the actress that they got is doing a really fantastic job of embodying that character. There's a full developer diary out now on the Square Enix if you guys want to watch like the in detail about her talking about taking on that role, working with Ashley from a behind the scenes perspective.

And she put out a tweet of like, \"I would love to voice the character again, but the SAG strike.\" Oh, right, I forgot about that. So she's still working on the project. Yeah, it's interesting those like ripples finally being felt because I, you know, with contracts, all the different things, you're never sure when other shoes are going to drop and you see, okay, this is what the strike is actually doing to video games.

Learning the board, everything's doing fine. What happened is there was an Uncharted event down in LA. They're doing all over the world for people to go play The Lost Legacy, get some hands-on time with it. Kinda Funny, I was invited. I was like, \"Cool, can we do it? Let's play.\" And they're like, \"No.\" And I'm like, \"I don't really want to ruin the experience for myself.\" Then I'm not going to worry about it too much.

I spent about 40 minutes playing Uncharted: The Lost Legacy at a preview event in Los Angeles about a week ago, and I would like to thank PlayStation for having me out there. Now, the one message I want to drive home to you guys watching and listening right now is to not sleep on this game.

This is more than that. And by saying that, you would be doing a huge disservice to the game itself and to what Naughty Dog is trying to do with Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Naughty Dog is pushing the industry standard for DLC just like they did with The Last of Us: Left Behind. And I'm just saying this, guys, right now, we are seeing a studio evolve right before our eyes. And for those who are listening right now in the podcast, I do have some awesome Uncharted: Lost Legacy footage. And if you are there listening right now or watching, don't worry, guys, I won't have any kind of crazy spoilers, anything like that. I'll keep this impression as generic as possible regarding the demo itself.

It happens right after the riverboat scene and you see Chloe and Nadine, they pull up to this big, big, big area of the Western Ghats in this Chapter 4. And here is what I like to call Naughty Dog accomplishes what, as I say, the open world chapter. That's right. Naughty Dog has made an open world experience. And so this whole Western Ghats is your sandbox to play in. And just the thought of it that Naughty Dog has designed this play box gets me really excited. So basically, Chloe opens up this map, which is the equivalent of Nathan Drake's journal. She draws and doodles on this map. And this map is this huge stage. And Naughty Dog, it's like saying, \"Go ahead, accomplish these objectives however you want and we will keep up with you,\" which is really awesome about this because I was told by Naughty Dog is that the scenes in the dialogue and all that kind of stuff will change on base how you tackle the objectives.

And we open up the map, there's just not glitter with all these icons and side-quests. No, everything's there. The purpose, eating the enemy NPCs, they have a purpose. They, they're there to either like tell a little bit more of the story or, you know, they're just not, they're just sleeping on the campground, anything like that. So, you know, I would be amiss though not to compare to Ubisoft titles or compare it to Breath of the Wild. I would say that those are just huge proportions. You know, those are huge maps. And I really feel that Naughty Dog gets the design correct. And to put this game in a metaphor, it's like a gourmet dish. Everything on the plate has a purpose. It's artistic, it's beautiful, the design, all of it. And it's really, really, really delicious.",

Right there, that's what I think is the real story here for Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is Naughty Dog learning and building on what they've learned before in the past. So you had the Madagascar chapter in Uncharted 4, like I said, and they built that. They went from a wide linear experience to an open world experience. And that's what's really cool. And that's what's really admirable into what Naughty Dog does as a studio rather than doing a cut and paste job. They went ahead and challenged themselves and they were able to turn around in ten months time and made an open world experience. And not only that, it will still have the moment-to-moment action.

So you got this really awesome gourmet dish. I don't know why I'm going back to that, but it just makes so much sense. And I'll leave you guys with this. I could not get a game playtime from Naughty Dog. However, I do agree with Neil Druckmann when he tweeted out to savor it. And I cannot wait to savor this game more on August 22nd when it comes out. Thank you guys so much for having me. This is SanchoWest. Thank you to all the Kinda Funny Best Friends. Back to you, Greg and Andrea. Thank you, Sancho. He did an excellent job. He's awesome.

Why I think this fits into the Roper Report is the fact that this is the first time they're out there saying this is an open world area from Naughty Dog in an Uncharted game and tackles however you want to. I think that's interesting for a number of reasons. Of course, back at E3, there was a one, I think we talked about here on Games Daily at some point, there was a pull quote of like, \"Yeah, you know, will Naughty Dog ever do an open-world game?\" And there was an idea like, \"We've thought about it, we've tinkered with it, but we don't know.\" And I think this is an interesting step forward for it.

Come on, Andrea.\" IGN posted an article today about Uncharted: The Lost Legacy having a chapter that provides, quote, \"the most openness in an Uncharted game yet,\" end quote. \"Do you think that this is Naughty Dog testing the waters on what an open-world game for their studio can be?\" Andrea, I don't think Naughty Dog needs to make an open-world Uncharted game. I think they have a very specific style for this franchise and it's been working for them. Players love the narrative aspect of it. I think it's a really nice blend of open areas and, you know, scripted linear sequences. And I think that that's fine. I agree. Um, I would go as far as say this is, I'm testing it though.

I think they are such an interesting team in terms of how many games they work on, the way they move their staff around, that if anybody has an idea for an open-world, you have to sit there like, \"Well, how does that work? And how do you do it?\" And I think a chapter in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy makes sense, right? Because it is like, \"Well, how would that affect our dialogue?\" We're a studio that hangs our hats on interactions and characters. I don't necessarily think it's this is a test because in Uncharted 4 there were open-world areas similar with the Jeep area, right? Right.

I neither do I. That's why it's always fun for us to sit here and talk about it. But I think that like, I, from what they're saying, this is the most open, right? So yeah, it's taking what they did in Uncharted 4 with that chapter and even further, I guess, and seeing how that would work.

It's going to be long. It's two different characters. Fine.\" But then you look at things and talk about yesterday, actually, what I'm talking about Uncharted was the fact that it's using the same stuff as Uncharted 4, right?

You're like, \"Holy, this is huge.\" This doesn't look like, and it's funny because, you know, Sancho and the front said, you know that, you know, they're redefining what DLC can be. And I guarantee back at the studio, Kurt like winced, right? Because it's like, \"Oh, they don't like thing it is DLC anymore.\" It's not. Yeah, it's standalone for 40 bucks.
