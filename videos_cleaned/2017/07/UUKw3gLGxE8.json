And I'm like, I got to click on this. I started watching the video and it made me uncomfortable. I feel like she hasn't been out for that long, but I mean, it was this was like 2008. Yeah, man, it was how young was she? Like 19. It was creepy. The whole thing was very creepy. He was very emotional. He might have been crying. Maybe he was in character. No, dude, when he crashed, give me your stats again. This is 2008. This happened. All right. Emma Stone article here from June 19th, 2011, where Emma was flattered by the video and then says in late August, the 50-year-old funny man posted a video on his website in which he expressed his feelings for The Amazing Spider-Man star. Yeah, 2008 is way too early, dude. Man, yeah, 2011. You know, I must be talking about something else then 'cause I was at my old house and",

I was creeped out by Jim Carrey making a video toward some girl. It might have been pre-Emma Stone. Oh, here's the video. It wasn't this 2011. Then what are you thinking? I don't know if it's if it's not the video, I think I'm crossing stories. Is this like Jim Carrey in 23 where you start seeing the number 23 everywhere? No, wait, Vernon, do you think? Hold on. Tim is in. He got he got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I am so wrong about everything. That is the video. I did not watch it in my old house at 3:00 a.m. to procrastinate.

See, now what I jump to there as I said he'd be more serious movies. You're like, no, I meant it because like that remember Jim Carrey kept trying to make more serious movies instead of just exactly. Well, yeah, that and then The Majestic. No, I think that was still goofy, wasn't it? Was bad. Majestic. Yeah, but I remember like it was that thing like they weren't performing like his comedies were that his big problem. And I think Scissorhands was like such a weird movie, right? Edward Scissorhands.
