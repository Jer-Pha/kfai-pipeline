So when I left Boware 3 years ago it was the most difficult decision of my career. I need some time off. Needed a bit of a change and wanted to get involved in a new wave of disruptive technologies that were emerging. The last few years have been transformative for me from having time to reflect on what I most want to do to working with new technologies at platform scale. And now I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to return to Lead Boware a studio that I think that I think of as home. I'd also like to wish my good friend Aaron Flynn the very best in in the future. Aaron and I have worked together from the earliest days of Star Wars Star Wars Nights of the Old Republic to setting the foundation for Anthem.

Cuz I was coming into the morning show right as this posted. So up until I just read that I didn't didn't know two and two together that Aaron was gone now in case he was in. Um I don't think I've seen an official statement. I don't know if he's tweeted or anything or something like that or if IGN or anybody else has dug into it or whatever cuz that is like oh man what a bummer cuz Aaron's great.

So so if Casey was talking to them about hey I'd like to come back. Maybe the thing he was doing was like this was cool for a while and now I'm going to exit and try something else. Um maybe it was just a coincidence of time that Aaron was like \"Actually I wanted to go do this other thing so how about I step down in case he comes back?\" I hope it was amicable like that.

After 17 years with Boware today I announced that I'll be leaving the studio at the end of July and that Casey Hudson is returning to Edmonton to take on the role of general manager for Boware.

However GameSpot expounds on all this. The Destiny beta client received a big new update today. The client itself was up for preload last week and the file size was less than 400 megabytes. Today's update meanwhile clocks in at 1.6 GB on PlayStation 4 suggesting it contains all the beta's content. You need to install the update if you want to play Destiny beta. As announced previously the beta be has already begun by the time I read this so I can skip out on that and what I just said. In the Destiny beta the homecoming story mission will be open to all.

The Overwatch beta did not require PlayStation Plus but did need gold on Xbox. Paragon does not require PlayStation Plus but that might be an agreement with Sony. The MMO Final Fantasy 14 does not require PlayStation Plus but the game is paytoplay and has its own subscription service. DC Universe Online is another game that doesn't require PlayStation Plus. So why does it irk me slightly that players are required to pay for a portion of a limited beta? Maybe because it's limited or timed as opposed to ongoing betas such as Gwent which is free but has microtransactions that let you get more cards. I feel very mixed on this and I'm not sure where I stand. How do you feel about this and paying for betas in general? Thanks for all the hard work. I look forward to watching and listening every day.

That's a good point and I but I think to my point with uh Gone Home to Outlast and Tacoma to Outlast 2 is the fact that when something's brand new and you don't know what you're getting in for you, the jump scares are new and you don't we haven't had a real survival horror game in quotes in so long where it's not we can fight things and shoot things and do this different stuff.
