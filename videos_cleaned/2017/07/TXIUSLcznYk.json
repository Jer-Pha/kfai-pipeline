They're talking about who the forerunners are to direct um this your boy Ryan Gosling movie movie Mind Studios uh the Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve is reportedly one of the filmmakers being considered to take the helm of James Bond 25 after two years of uncertainty following the release of the last James Bond film Spectre. The 007 franchise got back on track this weekend with the announcement of a November 9 release date by the film's producers and the reported return of Daniel Craig. He's coming with Skyfall and Spectre director Sam Mendes out of the picture. The next big move for the production will be hiring of a new helmer and it appears that at least three candidates are in the",

According to Deadline, Denis Villeneuve, Hell or High Water director David Mackenzie, and Yann Demange, a relative newcomer to feature films, are being considered. For the time being, it appears the production has moved away from the idea of hiring Sherlock director Paul McGuigan as well as Christopher Nolan, a self-professed Bond fanatic. Can you **** imagine? Oh, if Christopher Nolan did it, I would be 100% Christopher Nolan James Bond movie. That would be **** great because he would be he would make it like he would make the Bond film the seminal Bond film in my opinion. Yeah, or I would hate it. It it would be so good man.

Um I want to see them go back to a more uh intense cerebral Bond like we saw in Casino Royale. You know I want that sort of faded horrible like the world is a shitty place and this guy's just doing the best he can to get around it.
