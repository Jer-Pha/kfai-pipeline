Is this a new shirt? I don't, not new. Do you wear it often? I just don't feel like I see it. It's in my monthly rotation, not not a weekly, not bi-weekly. Okay, yeah, it's my boy, The Cutting Linguist. Oh, I've heard of them. Ton friends, friends of, no, they're all just related to Q15 in some way. Yeah, some way, shape, or form. That's where it is. They are Q15. That's what I said. Thank you very much. Q15. God, I hate you all. What Q15? You ha Q5. I'm correcting him. Why are you the problem? For me is that it sounds so much like Chicago's Q101. Hold, can you say that one more time? What? Never mind. I don't remember what I said. I don't have a problem with you. You said, I love you.

Oh yeah, his new sous vide. It's so good. Is that what it is? Yeah, well, it's like, so the sous vide is the water bath thing. The blowtorch is to cook the meat afterwards. Maybe, maybe I bring some steaks on Sunday in my little sous vide machine. We're doing a stream all day on Sunday if you didn't know, getting ready for Kinda Funny Live 3's release.

Okay, that's, you know, it's it's f*** culture and you can't get away from it. This you chose. You put this on somebody and don't tell me maybe the grandfather was named Ryan like this. Great. It's 20. Well, now it's 2017. This I'm assuming this is him here. Mhm. First off, hold on, let's take another side branch on this side branch. Yeah, Meredith Warner went to school with her.

But it see, it's actually got some context to it because Meredith is interviewing her apparently, and so this is just they screen capped out of the LA Times for whatever. But again, back to the main branch of the side note we're on here. F***. Oh, well, 30 years, you know. Oh, 30 years ago, you still could have spelled this guy's name, the Rian with a Y, and everybody like, you're honoring grandfather. Instead, you did it like this, and now I'm reading. I look like a f*** idiot. It's not your fault, Rian Johnson. So, but here's the thing, didn't want his name like that. Too f*** bad. That's what his mom gave him. What you got?

I'm looking it up. I'm on it. Zaq. Can we call him Funny Zach ZQ? He's really funny. ZQ. Yeah, it's a lot, man. This is sending my emails. I'm like, I'm f*** confused. Right, right. And this too many Zachs. Too many Zachs, spelling. It's just we've gotten to a point where we're all, and this is us as human people, as American people, we're too stubborn and set in our ways to just admit something's wrong.

He got teased a lot, and in his later years changed his name to B.R.Y. Really? So somebody somebody actually realized that, hey, I I can fix this.

Missoula Meredith writes, Star Wars Canon dictates that all episodic films in the Lucasfilm franchise must begin with four things. First, the intro, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, and then the Star Wars logo accompanied by John Williams' bombastic score in the F, and finally the crawl, as if gliding through the space itself, a collection of carefully crafted bright yellow words float upward across the screen, explaining what has happened and setting the stage for the upcoming action. The writing sets the tone and The Empire Strikes Back. For, thank you very much. I read this. Toss me in your blind. You assemble the morning show stories.

At Disney's D23 Expo in Anaheim, Johnson presented a behind-the-scenes sneak peek of The Last Jedi to a cheering crowd of thousands. Afterward, we asked Johnson about the pressure of creating the perfect crawl, which is something I've thought about a lot. Great. Sure. Out of making the movie, sure, that's one thing, but those f*** words. Sure. I I I don't want that pressure. Do you want that pressure, Kevin? No, really. That seems like that seems like a lot to handle. It's super simple. You just get out the most important. It's like writing a news story. Most important facts first. All right.

Luke's been on a f*** rock forever, not eating. He could have saved the day a long time ago, but he's a f*** f***. All your heroes suck. So what Rian actually said was that was petrifying. Actually, you know, I just did it. I just started writing the draft. I wrote something, and it was terrible. And then I was watching one of the behind-the-scenes things, and Lucas said it's like writing a hu. I realized as I was refining it what he meant. We didn't finish the opening crawl and totally lock it until a few weeks ago, actually, because you're like, do we need this word? Do we need that word? What if we shift? It's like a poem.

He's like, it would be funny if it was poop first for the Star Wars Universe. Uh, that's the whole crawl, just the word poop. So you, I feel like you guys are, we would have got along except for his name. But then he answered seriously, turning to the side to avoid being caught on camera, mouthing even one word from the highly secretive script. Decimated, he said, and he looked quite proud. Hell yeah, I like that. Okay, okay, so yeah, that's that was it. But I thought that was interesting, cause shout out to Meredith. Her on, she's doing well with her on Vox for quite a while. Vox.

I grew up with Happy Days on Nick at Nite, right? I it might as well come out right then. Of course, we've talked about this before. Nobody realized it was shot in the 80s.
