So, my thing is when we think about marketing and we think about advertising, I think a lot of people quickly jump to, \"Oh, that doesn't work on me.\" M, you know, you think it's like, oh, why would HP buy the HP Pavilion? Like, what's the point of them having their name on a place that uh Jay-Z performs or like whatever sports teams do their sports stuff? I've heard of those. Like, yeah, exactly. Um, or like when you see a commercial on TV, it's like, what's the point of this? Like there you see Super Bowl, right? It's like, oh, it cost this much millions of dollars for a 30-second spot.

It's like in the comments would be like why why are you doing this? Like we obviously don't care. And it's like my thing is I've I've put a lot of thought into that over my life. And I'm like it must be working cuz people it has never stopped. It's evolved and changed over time of where they put the thing. But it's still a smattering of just if we say it enough, people will listen and people will know.

Yeah. It's brand recognition. Ex brand recognition. And then when you go further than that, when you go to the Blue Apron or whatever, it it becomes more of like, all right, if one person does and like, \"Oh, I actually really like this. I use this.\" They tell someone else and it kind of goes from there. It's the recognition actually turned into recommendation and it goes further and like, \"All right, cool.

Uh, which is very sharable and very uh, you don't need to watch every other episode for it to make sense. Every episode could be its own quote unquote viral hit, right? And you can go forward from there, but you can kind of design things with marketing and advertisement in them to help them expand and help them get out there. And what I'm so impressed by with uh the Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator, okay, is that it made it everywhere, right? It you didn't need to pay for advertisement anywhere.

People retweet things every day, right? So, it's a point where it's like, okay, what does an actual retweet mean in terms of the clickthrough rate is what we call it in the biz. There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of words being used, but uh really though, what impresses me is it's not just one thing or the other thing or paying the money. It's the combination of all of it. I've seen this game on Kotaku, on Pitchfork, on BuzzFeed, on like all these sites that are very different than each other and they're all in completely different verticals in some cases.

For I didn't expect that one to be to be a thing, but I guess to sort of go back of like I it's not um I don't think it's a nefarious thing. Uh but what we what we did when we made uh this game was like we thought about uh the idea of like you know like going back to Hot Pepper Gaming, the the idea of sharable content like like how do you do you create something that one person wants to share with another person because like you can spend as many marketing dollars you as you want on certain things uh but the at the end of the day like if someone doesn't see that and share with someone else like you're kind of like dead in your tracks.

So like um you know like even like from day one of Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator, um like we we saw like ways to sort of compress the idea like the more you can compress an idea the further we'll travel online. So like even in the title of Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator, the acronym is DDA DDS DADS which is just a dad joke in itself. Um, so like that we sort of like when we were making the game, me and Leighton, we we went forward with that ethos of like um how do you make things that people can screen cap and share with other people like how do you how do you write about this game or talk about this game that um that is designed so that like someone could see that and then someone could tweet about that that because the easier it is for someone to explain the game, the easier it is for them to",

And so it was a lot of like seeding things into this game that we know that people will want to share with their friends and that hit a lot of different like interests and senses of humor. And like it's been really interesting to read replies to, you know, the announced tweets and stuff cuz people just like tag their friends and are like, \"This is so you.\" Um, which I",

It's exactly what it says on the tin and it's, you know, that sets up an expectation of what do you think it might be? And then I hope that when people play it, they'll see that, you know. Yeah. I want to go on saying this that like the stuff like people haven't downloaded this game yet and like all we're talking about right now is math. But I think we did like I I I think what we've done so far like I think that's like sort of like proof in in the model I suppose.

But it's you guys talking about it in a very frank way of like I you know Vernon knows the internet and he in terms of like how the YouTube works and how sharing content there works you know references to come together and be like we're putting this stuff in there not because it's a hook in terms of traditional advertising because we know how people consume things on the internet.

Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting for me thinking back to when I was at IGN and it's like all right cool 8 million subscribers and how are we going to make a video? Especially when I was like all right I know that I have this audience I can put something in front of. How do I make something that I think is super cool, but what can I change about that that will get the most sizable part of that pie chart to at least be interested in watching it?

But I think that you saw like the more you um sort of like included your own personality in the topics, like the more real it felt, right? Yeah. It's like making the thing that you want to make or we've said this over and over pitching this game is like you make something for 10 people on the internet like really specific and like that resonates with people because they see how true that is to those 10 people and it makes them want to share because there's other if you're like that and this is the BuzzFeed mentality that we've talked about so much.

It's like it's literally the basis of memes in general. Like how many memes are like here's this thing that I only thought that I did, but actually everyone else also does. Like things are so much more universal than I think people realize they are. And it's so great cuz the internet like let you see like oh hey everybody else does this going back to the Pitchfork thing cuz I think this is what the whole topic spurred from is so Pitchfork is a music website. It's kind of a music blog. Very hipstery like this is what you should be listening to exactly type But as a huge audience of people, you know, look at me, the hipster version.

Um, and I was like, so like, um, I was like Pup and I follow each other on Twitter, like I'm friends with their their record label. So, I was like, this is real dumb, but I'm just going to ask them. So, I asked them and then we licensed a song for them and then we drew them into the game. And I didn't think that was going to uh be big enough to get on Pitchfork.

You you told you didn't just say, \"Hey guys, we're making a a Dad Dating Simulator.\" they would have just discarded that email.

And even talking about things like you were saying that you designed the characters with cosplay in mind. Like that's something that uh our friends at Rooster Teeth, like they talk about with Ruby so much where they're like, \"We made sure that we designed characters uh with things that are recognizable and that you can have they have multiple outfits and there's the casual version that can be made so that when they go to conventions, you just see an army of Ruby people.\" And it's like that is marketing in itself cuz there's nothing more like",

Yeah. And also from a fan art perspective and also just like I wanted to make sure that, you know, everyone had a dad that they felt like they could relate to or a dad that's like, \"Oh, that's me or that's who I want to date.\" But also just like, you know, from a design sense like color blocking, each dad has a very distinct color scheme and like just a lot of really specific things where like no matter what form you're seeing them in, it's like instantly recognizable of, okay, that's Dream Daddy.

Sorry, I keep going I keep forgetting parts of this conversation, but I was so impressed by it because so the Pitchfork thing, you ask the band to be in the the game, they are and whatever. But then you also are like, but wait, if we have licensed music in the game, that's going to cause problems for Twitch streamers. I can't I can't talk about that one just yet. That's uh we're we're I want people to find out about that one. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Oh, man. It'll be hopefully be a good reveal. I know.

Um, we're we're just we're so we're we're so in the weeds with this stuff, but like it's um I think that in this day and age like the challenge is that like uh like statistically uh uh there have been uh the the most amount of Steam games that exist on Steam or like published in the last year like like so like um so like you're you're up against so many things and right now I think as a creator and we see this on YouTube as well is like you it's not enough to just to be good like there there's just like an ocean of good ideas that nobody has seen because nobody has shared it with anyone else.

Like I step away from the internet for three days and come back and I'm like I don't know what's happening anymore. I'm out of the loop. So like putting together a long-term plan of like what works and especially like you know we made this game a year and a half. Most of the work was done in the last like 10 months. I would even go so far as to say is in the last six months. And like it's like I can't even imagine games with a longer",

And like it's like I can't even imagine games with a longer development period you know trying to stay relevant and on top of things and still be trying to like the ephemerality of the internet. Do you see that happening though? I mean Veronika you've got such an interesting take because you're a YouTube content creator. You worked in Maker Studios which you know the MCN of course you were worrying about analytics how to advertise all those sort of things. RIP. and then making uh video games now. Do you see it being something that'll be like you know how eventually every great idea on the indie scene will eventually go up to a AAA? Do you see that being a thing where EA and all these other people are going to have to start sitting there and actually do this? I think so.

Um I I think I think um you know like you're you you always the fear is sameness right? Like um it's like the what is it the blue ocean market theory versus the red ocean market theory. like when when you're when you're combating sameness um it's just not something that people can share. And I think you can only exist on IP for so long or like beloved IP and like that's always going to be a thing and there's always going to be a market for that but like if you're breaking in with a new thing or if you're trying to make something big that people can share. I mean you you already seeing it now like PS4 has a share button. Um like like screen has like like Steam has screen screen capture right there in it. So does the Switch right? Which I thought was super crazy at the first. there's a there's a there's a dedicated button to it right now. So I think",

So I think I think even AAAs are seeing like the the fact that like these games live or die by people talking about them. And it's not just about whether you have a good experience sitting down on the couch and playing a game but whether whether or not you're having a good experience sharing your own experience with those people that you uh you like those people in the same community as you. So do you think it's similar to the way of I always talk about it you know it's always interesting this generation who are making video games now who grew up with Mario right? experiences and makes The Last of Us. Somebody's consuming The Last of Us right now and is going to make X. Do you see that being the same way in terms of advertising and marketing games? Do you think there's the people who are growing",

Yeah. Yeah. Um I mean like there like I'm not the only person doing this. Like we aren't the only people. We aren't the only people like looking at games from this perspective. And there's going to people be people like smarter than me who are going to crack this code faster than me. Um I'm just But like I'm excited for that.

And then two years later like there there was sort of like that push back to it of like oh let's make things wholesome now. Um and like let's care about each other and let's just be nice to each other. And like it's so cool to see the evolution of a culture like that of of of you know uh a community of people appreciating sincerity.

But you I mean Tim as somebody else he's been on the internet forever and consumer forever. Do you see brands being able to do that? Because what what what about being sincere with marketing and advertising and doing all these different things. What there's such a fine line that is Dream Daddy and then on the other side the Kylie Jenner giving a protest person at Pepsi. I just think there needs to be someone that cares because the moment that there is a a person within that corporation corporations are the big evil corporations until it's like no this is someone that genuinely cares and actually wants to be this.

Not an actual like trying to get into things in a different way. And I I know that if you're talking about I feel like nowadays Coke could be potentially involved in indie games in a much more meaningful way than Pizza Hut was in um Crazy Taxi. Crazy Taxi. Nice. Yeah. Great game. KFC. Great. Fantastic. I I got a question for you guys. So what was the strategy behind uh Let me start that sentence again. Whenever I put something out I try my best to make it as easy for the consumer as possible like you were saying of the dumbing it down to just the simplest thing but I like saying \"Here's the thing. Click here to do it.\" So it's one",

Like why not stressed why not do that at the same time to to stress us out the most I think. Um but no really I think that it's uh letting people get excited about it and for that hype to build for people to speculate what the characters are going to be. I mean the teaser trailer is just the silhouettes of the dads. Um and that was an intentional thing. It's not like we revealed the lineup. Like if you click on the links of like Dream Daddy up or you go to the Tumblr you can see the lineup of the characters and like from the silhouettes you can compare and see what their names are. And like it just really encouraged a lot of uh speculation over what it's going to be. And also uh just fan",

Like half of the things that I play or watch now like I find because artists I really like are making fan content and doing cool fan art. Um and I think that that's such a good like sharable hook for people because it's just like a friend telling you to watch something but like you know here's this cool art that's like probably this person like inserting some things about the uh game or movie or whatever that's interesting. Um so like obviously dating sims uh really do encourage fan content like that because at a certain point like you know you can only cover so much in a dating sim.

But like if you look at something like BioWare games with like Mass Effect and uh Dragon Age I know of so many people who are just like really prolific fan artists for those things and like that is such a huge sharable hook of like wow who's this like hot elf guy? Like how how can I get into that? And I know also a lot of those same people like only play BioWare games because they're interested in the romances and the relationships. And I think um kind of catering to this market of people that's like a lot of young I I hesitate to say women on the internet but like I think it's largely like young women um who kind of grew up like with a little bit more uh you know with the internet.

So I think it's this like really interesting culture where it's a lot more accessible to people who you know might not have come up like through a traditional like here are all the seminal things that you play and like all my friends play video games.
