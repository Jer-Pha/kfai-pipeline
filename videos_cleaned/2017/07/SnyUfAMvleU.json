Yeah, so the first legendary Pok\u00e9mon will arrive this weekend. According to Polygon, Pok\u00e9mon Go is finally getting some legendary monsters. And this weekend, trainers around the world will be able to catch their first legendary Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9mon Go Fest attendees will get first dibs on legendary monsters on Saturday, July 22nd at the event. Players who have tickets to this event in Chicago's Grand Park will have the chance to catch a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon during an epic raid battle. That is, if they catch enough Pok\u00e9mon to unlock it first. Now, if they succeed in defeating it, Pok\u00e9mon Go players everywhere will be able to start catching that same monster at their own local gyms starting July 23rd.

Other than that, they'll be great for showing off in battle or to friends via your Pok\u00e9dex. Yeah, so are you still playing Pok\u00e9mon Go? Did you play Pok\u00e9mon Go? It's the hot new game everyone's playing right now. Um, I did play it when it first came out. I played it. I used to walk around Lake Merritt in Oakland having a go of it. Uh, um, when I went to Ireland, me and my buddies, you know, you could get those maps where you could like hack where people where Pok\u00e9mon were popping up.

I also did a special piece for Playboy Gaming last April when San Francisco had a Pok\u00e9 Crawl. I don't know if you went to it or heard about it, but it was thousands of people on the streets. Uh, if you guys want to see just how many thousands of people I'm talking about, that video still exists on the Gamer Next Door YouTube channel. You can watch it. Um, Andrea Renee's Pok\u00e9 Crawl, I think it's called. Um, it was a really interesting experience meeting so many people who are so invested in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, people who were cosplaying, people who had been playing since they were kids, and everyone was comparing, you know, techniques at gyms and who has what in their Pok\u00e9dex.

Did you get the sense that the people who are at that were folks that had like, because what was this, you said April of, were these people who were still playing it or were these people who were uh who had kind of fallen off and were jumping back in? No, this was last year. Oh, this is before it came out. No, this is when, oh, when did it come out? It came out last year. It did around that time. Yes. Okay, so that was hot. It came out in like February, I think, when it came out. Some reason I had it as a summer game. Uh, well, it was really big over the summer, right?

I think, you know, adding the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon is coming a little bit late. But I had the opportunity to speak to the folks at Niantic at The Game Awards, um, earlier. So that was what, December. And I one of the things that they said was obviously the reaction worldwide was much bigger than they anticipated.

So they're kind of getting around to it now. Yeah, I mean, they also made hundreds of millions of dollars. So clearly they were able to increase their workforce, get more people on board. But it's probably, you know, it is the thing where like, it's a shame where they couldn't get a lot more creative content, as you said, out sooner. But you also don't necessarily want to rush that stuff. So at least hopefully they're doing a good job of it now.

And if they have this like epic raid and it's essentially like a couple of thousand people with their phones out in the middle of a park, like that's the type of thing that's going to get people talking about it. You know, that'll be like pictures shared on social media and news crews probably and everything. So, um, that's probably what they need to kick started again. It seems like it's a little bit late in the summer though. I would have thought that they would have come out swinging for when people are like, I mean, we kind of live in evergreen of the world.

Um, all right, I think it's time to maybe move on unless you have some deep Pok\u00e9mon thoughts you would like to share. I'm looking forward to hearing what people think about this. I think I'm looking forward to seeing with the reaction. This will kind of be like the, are you going to go out, try to get this legendary Pok\u00e9mon? I'll probably give it a go again. Like I did have fun with it. I was more into the social aspect of it than I was like trying to hunt them all down 'cause I'm like, man, this just too many of them. I got all these eggs.

And like now I work from, so like my main initiative or like situation to go get Pok\u00e9mon is now completely gone. So I heard a really good hack from somebody that said if you tape your phone to a dog to a ceiling fan, what it'll it'll like simulate you walking if you keep it on a slow speed. Oh my gosh, I'm like, that's a really good cheat. I could tape it to my cats and then it would simulate sleeping most of the day. Okay, uh moving on up.

A new trademark filing suggests that a miniature Nintendo 64 could also be on the way. The filing in question is for a controller that appears identical to that of the Nintendo 64. Nintendo, are they sure? I mean, have you seen the photos? I mean, it's impossible to like look at an N64 controller and think it's something else. That's true.

Yeah, this really looks like an N64 pack. Yeah, you guys can find the image pretty much anywhere online right now. It's this this news has spread far and wide. But yeah, and these stories came out ahead of the SNES Classic and ahead of the NES version as well. So it's looking like we are going to get a mini one. So I mean, why not?

Uh, but then to a lot of folks, N64 would be equally as nostalgic. Um, and in fact, then you're basically collecting all the people who played SNES games as teenagers and maybe in college and stuff were super into the N64 and things like that.

I mean, that's I think going to be the challenge, you know, if Nintendo continues making these Classics, is that how do you weedle down the library of games? Because, you know, as we moved forward with each generation of console, the libraries just got bigger, right? And so you're right. Yeah, if they had to pick 20 games, yeah, for the N64 Classic.

That means nothing less than a year and a half after the game was released. Absolutely love what both of you bring to the show. Thanks, J Dub. Yeah, this is such a difficult balancing act.
