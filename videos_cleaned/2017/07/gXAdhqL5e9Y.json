This is, this is way more fun. This is way more fun, more control over the character. I again, I have better grasp of what to do and what it wants me to do. Like, oh, okay, it didn't even touch Crash 3. Yeah, yes, which I think is the, I think in this Trilogy, three is the worst. So okay, let's what's your history with Crash? Uh, that is the game that got me into gaming. This is why I'm sitting here right now is because uh, a PlayStation kid grew up Spyro and Crash. Um, so I was through all of it like I' I've been I played every game. I was obsessed as a little kid because I have an obsessive personality I guess no um so like um I had like like a",

Uh, on CTR, you can actually unlock Oxide. Yeah, I was one of the kids who did. You're **** crazy. Yeah, that was impossibly hard, but I did it as a kid. Um, so very deep, vast history with the Bandicoot. Um, so I do have like a ranking of everyone. What was your ranking growing up though? The ranking for me always went two, 3, 1. No, three, no, sorry, CTR. Don't get, yeah, exactly. Obviously CTR top god tier **** god tier, but just of the the first three. Oh, okay, so uh it was 2, 3, 1. Okay, cuz growing up for me it always went 3, 1. Warped was my favorite. I loved it so much. I thought it was so cool. I loved all the vehicle stuff and everything about it.

Yeah, well, I say even before the Trilogy, I was still Warped was ahead of one, but since they went back and fixed a lot of the issues with one, it really changed it for me and I I'd say it's even like like two like one right there. Yeah, I I agree with you there because I well actually no I do think that one is not nearly as good as two. No, I but I'm saying it's like right like snipping out of seal so because the thing is the biggest problem with three is there's way too much gimmicky **** that does not hold up at all.
