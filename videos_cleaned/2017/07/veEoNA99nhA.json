We're going to listen to the tutorial. Each of you is going to be sent a task to your device. Like raise your hand if you've ever farted. But one of you will get nothing. And that person is the faker. Everyone wants to figure out who the faker is. And the faker just wants to blend in. When you hear the go sound you either raise your hand or not depending on whether you've ever farted before which you have and the faker just has to fake it. After that everyone votes on their device who may think the faker is. If everyone picks the correct person the faker is caught. But here's the most important part. Fakers if you're caught in a lie if you raise your hand when you really should have kept it down lie cheat deny come up with whatever story you have to to throw other players off the scent. be the faker.

Some of the tasks will involve raising your hand or pointing or maybe making a weird face but there will always be a faker and you'll have three chances to catch him. Oh one more quick suggestion before we get going. It's important to be able to see each other. So if possible consider sitting in a semicircle or like small lines facing each other whatever works best while still feeling comfortable. Send me some kind of laugh. Let's start with just an easy one. Just like we saw a minute ago. Everyone's going to get a task that involves raising your hand. Okay. Sending the task to your devices. Now oh what the Well played.
