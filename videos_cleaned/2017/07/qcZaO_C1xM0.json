I think it was a tip actually. I think it was a tip on one of the morning shows. It's a blur. But one of our fans Xan Fair wrote in on one of our many platforms and said \"Hey guys, now that you've seen Spider-Man Homecoming and loved it, I'm wondering if you guys are planning on ranking the MCU movie so far.
