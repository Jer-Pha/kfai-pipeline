Yeah, I know. That's the whole thing, like dropping creepers on you left and right. Like, I just want to finish this. Go away. And number three, the community is smaller, but growing.

Anyways Spencer or I should say NerdLife451 #3881 says \"I just recently built my first gaming computer and have a few pretty popular games like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds but playing alone gets boring so I could really use some friends. So if any best friends out there want to play together or just chat they can add me on Discord.\" Ps keep it up with the lovely Irish cream. Yeah. Welcome to PC video games the good life.
