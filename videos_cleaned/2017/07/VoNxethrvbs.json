Cool Greg, Cool Greg's here everyone. So I guess we're gonna be answering all of y'all's questions. I did you submit it on Patreon, right Joey? Yes, Patreon.com/KindaFunny for all you $15 and above supporters. You know that website, you've heard of it. So uh Joey, do you want to lead us through these questions? I would love to lead because I haven't the faintest **** clue of what I read through these maybe five minutes. Perfect. Awesome. James Davis, aka 16 Bits of Awesome. Hey James Davis, I met James at RTX. I think we're going to get to that right now. Cool. Hey, first time producer, longtime seducer. I see what you did there. It was awesome seeing you and talking to some of you at RTX. I was the tall guy taking photos at your panel. Smiley face. Here's a link to a handful of the photos I took.

I didn't have the camera lens I usually work with, so I wasn't able to capture all of the great moments like Andy drawing on Greg moment. Top 10 RTX moment. It was a moment. However, I'm sure it's all documented on Twitter. Again, it was amazing seeing all of you that made an appearance. I look forward to coming back here to Austin. I do too. I really liked Austin. That was my first time there and it was super fun to get to meet um like a segment of our pop fan population that I don't feel like I get to see all the time for sure. I mean, I think there were a lot of faces out there that I wasn't like, I didn't know Alex was going. Alex O'Neal was going until like way later in the game. Maybe I knew and I kind of forgot.

Uh, I remember James Davis, he's the one who Jesus Christ, he's the one who gave me the uh the marker to draw on Greg. Yeah, uh that was pretty neat. So yeah, it was a great meeting you James. Uh, we also hung out at the that industry VIP party thing. Oh sweet. We got to talk there for a bit. So that was cool. I love it. Yeah, it was fun because I feel like there was like a smaller community group there, so it means that we got to spend a little bit more time with everybody. Um unfortunately, I did not like the that's right. I uh the first night I really wanted to go to the heel kick, but my parents came up and visited, so I was with them.

So my first day was like family time and then from then on it was I got to hang with community. I got a message from um um Tyler Westhaus. He was like, hey, kind of a bummer we didn't hang out. I was like, I know dude. Like I only got to hang with my brother for like two hours. My brother was like, hey, we're driving up. Let's get dinner and then we got to peace out. So well, I had to peace out. So I even my brother barely got limited me time, which kind of sucks cause I only got to see my nieces and my nephew for I really wanted to go. Yeah, they didn't take me.

I think like the whole weekend I was I wanted to hang with Stan Miles and and um and Cole and I saw Miles backstage once. We're like, dude, how the **** are you? We hugged each other. He was like, all right, I got to go. I was like, yeah, I got to go. And like we never saw each other again. It was a real bummer. Yeah, it was bummer.

I am. I was the first. It's not a big deal. Let's just move on. Okay, there we go. My question is an important one. Some would say the most important one. Fast and Furious rankings particularly. Please discuss why Tokyo Drift is such a terrible, no good, garbage. Okay, we're just going to have to stop right there though.

I think. I think it's definitely better than two. I don't know if it's better than four. I think two is easily the worst film. Definit um like it's not even close. It's not even close. Say that the last three were the best. Yeah, I would say so. There you I would say so. I would say so. Here's 5, 6, 7 or 6, 7, 8. I mean, seven are the best. I think that I think that it's like when we get to the last three Fast and Furious movies, even the last four, I'd say cause I really, you know, I really like five. It's my favorite.

Um I would say that uh the worst is Fast and the Furious is is Too Fast Too Furious. And then I would say second worst is probably the first movie. Oh no, I I liked part four better because it's more of a modern action movie and I think it just it aged way better, right? Obviously it it did, but um that's just you know what I feel like I want out of an action movie. Um and then I would put uh and then I would go. So we're ranking from worst to best. Yeah, so bottom of the list is two and then we go one and then we go four and then Tokyo Drift is in the middle of the pack. Yeah, but when I saw it, I was like, okay, I get it.

Darth Maul was cool. That's kind of how I feel with the last four movies. I mean like, yeah, but like except for they were they're great. Oh, it's not even close. Yeah, it's not even close. Um so I say we just leave that part blank cause I feel like that changes from person. Yeah, I I I right now here's how I'm feeling. 7, 8, 5, 6. That's how I'm feeling. Write them down, Greg. Have you seen all the Fast and Furious? No. I remember what we talking about. Damn, we need to change. Apparently all the best ones I have not seen. Well, they **** made me watch them.

I'm pretty I don't think he went. I Mike also Greg, stay close to the life. There you go. Um I had to write mine down. So going from the bottom, I go 2, 4, 3, 1. Oh, you put one above Tokyo Drift. I did. Interesting. Okay. Um cause I this is this is where I kind of like agree with Nick when we did the whole uh Marvel ranking of like I hate that argument. Ex set the ex at the tone. I also really the first one I think is funny. Um like the stupid like tuna sandwich line. Yeah, I like it. Um and then 8, 7, 6, 5. But really the top four, they're hard.

As far as I know, I know we all have different tastes. I'm not a movie critic, but I like it was a decision for me not to watch the newer ones cause I thought they looked like trash. Like I get what you guys are saying. Like they're like family and I get why Kinda Funny likes them, but I personally would never never watch any any of the new ones even with The Rock in there. They're fun action, not winning any Oscars over here. Yeah, um so I think probably the most things I liked about the series are things most people hated. So I'm putting Tokyo Drift as number one. I really liked it. Like it has so much rewatch value with me. Um Too Fast Too Furious, I enjoyed at the time. Really enjoyed it. I loved the parts with Jin.

That's what I'll say cause I love the Mortal Kombat movie too when it came out and now it's awful. But I think if you were to watch part two again now, you'd be like, oh, this is terrible. Yeah, I mean, I'd probably think it's about as good as I thought then, you know, where it's like Tokyo Drift. I really enjoyed. I liked it for what it I mean, it's a car movie at the day. I expect it to be pretty like the scene where they all get lost and there's just hundreds of cars. They get lost in that, you know, I think that is epic as **** to me more than a car going to another car through the buildings and everything. Like that's not cool to me. Like that's not realistic.

So you've just seen one, two, and three. Probably seen four just because of how life works, but I don't remember it like at all. It was pretty forgettable. The first three I remember like I remember I said drop it cause I got that for number one. Like I remember things. We hungry. Okay, cool. Thank you for the question, Logan. Thanks.

Um I think if you have a Nintendo Switch, have it in the open cause more likely uh than not people are going to have Nintendo Switches there and you're going to be like, oh, you play too. So there might be other people in your situation uh who are also looking for someone to hang out with and want to, you know, be friends with. So I guess just ask around. Don't be shy.
