Prose Vanek says, \"As you are the biggest Mass Effect fan I know, is Mass Effect Andromeda worth looking at even though I haven't played games like Zelda yet?\" Yes, absolutely. Um, I have said at length that it does have a ton of problems, but at its core, it's still a really great game.

And while I have been frustrated by some of its technical issues, I'm still going to go back eventually and and play it again. I just am not immediately enticed to go back as I have been with previous Mass Effect games. And I think that is in part two reasons. One, I want to wait until all the patches get in place. And two, there's just a lot of really good stuff to play right now. Yeah, yeah. Yes, if you like Mass Effect at all, I highly recommend going to play it. Andy, Andy Cortes, can you go get Andy, Kevin? Yeah, I need I need his feedback on this because he is the second biggest Mass Effect fan I know. I need you. I know, calm down, Andy.

I know you got a lot of questions there, but everything you love about BioWare and the Mass Effect series, the camaraderie with your crewmates and the loyalty missions and the really great blend of serious content with, you know, humor mixed in, all that's there. All of it's there. And, you know, the the multiplayer is back if you really like the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3.

The thing I was telling them, I think when we did that initial impressions, I think I made it 100 hours before I switched over Persona. And it was that I liked what's here. I liked the core of this game. I liked Ryder. I liked the Pathfinder. I love the idea of Andromeda. And I do like the group. And like, you know, one of my favorite memories so far, I was just reading the crew's initial emails to each other in their like thing of like them bitching about everybody, you know, who's doing what inside of the place. And it was like, this is why I'm going to come back because I do like this. And it wasn't that, oh my God, the innovations in this. It was just like, you see all that.

I feel it all the time. And for actually, I'm like, okay, this is good. It's just not great like I expected it to be. And so that's why I was able to put it down, but why I totally intend to go back to it. Mm-hmm. The Hashtag Inna says, \"How are you so good at Amplitude? Like seriously, that **** is unnatural.\" Oh, the Hashtag Inna, he's great. That's just years of practice. Hours and hours. As you know, like, it's just it's starting over if you make a single mistake. And it's like a start, restart, you know, like pause, restart, pause, restart. Yeah, if you make a mistake, if you want to get, you know, that like 90 to 100% accuracy, you gotta you gotta stop and quit and start over when you make a mistake. Just gotta get in that zone.

We'd have to do some like the score based thing. Yeah, I think the multiplayer in a rhythm, a music game like that is so hard to get right because even the tiniest bit of lag, yeah, will throw off your your accuracy and your ability to beat match properly.

It was like, because I played with you once at a preview of that a long, long ago. And it was just like too much going on. Where am I? I just want to play. Like there's already enough going on in Amplitude. Yeah, where am I? All of the like the weapons and attacking and stuff. Yeah, it's fun, but I'm more of a single-player guy when it comes to that. And Ago Skyborn says, \"Since you spent such a long time at GameTrailers, would you consider doing something with the Easy Allies guys?\" I would love to.

I still get people who reach out to me from the stuff I did at GT. And I miss it. I miss that crew a lot. They're all really great. So, how much did you work with those guys when you're because that was back when you were still in LA at that time, right?

Like they had their shows and like Kyle had his show and, you know, they had their reviews team set up. And, you know, they had their own thing going on. And I was just very grateful to be a small part of of that team. So, and I was in the same building as Smosh Games, right? Yeah, they all were in the same building. That's crazy.

You can watch it on YouTube. It's like a nine episode series, I think, or seven episodes where it was all these different women from across the games industry talking about, you know, different topics and games. It's actually a really well-done show. She is great. She is she's one of the funniest people. Yeah, her sense of humor is so dry in the best way.

They're one of the oldest game companies out there. And, you know, they've weathered the storm for decades of this industry.

It's an okay toy. You just played with Gia and G. And like having fun, that's not so bad. It was so upsetting. No, everybody else who is good enjoys it. I beat her in yoga. That's is there something wrong with this? Yeah, it's a good toy. It's not a good yoga simulator. You don't need and this is what they are. But like, do they want?

There's still released. It's rare to find them out there. Yeah, anyway, it was a really funny conversation. But it was like, these are normal people. Sure, I assume. But everyone in the barbershop was like excited about this thing. And it was like, wow, like I haven't seen that in the public since the Wii. Yeah, so I signed they're onto something. Yeah, that was the weird thing when I went to Missouri after the announcement of the name Switch, that first trailer.

Um, so this comes from Morsaying who tweets this question at me every single week for the new game for the Kinda Funny Gamescast. And especially when I have guests, he asked me this, \"What new features does Andrea think should be implemented for the next Armored Core?\" We were talking about we started recording. Um, I'm not gonna answer that because there should be new no new features. They should stop it. Question is, I yeah, it's Elise. And she's just like, let me tell ya.

BioShock, a wonderful game. I actually played that a couple of years after it came out. Really? I didn't play it when it first came out because I wasn't that into shooters until probably like eight years ago. And so I didn't play it when I originally came out. Um, excellent game. Mario Kart 64. Probably the best. Mario Kart: Double Dash!! It's okay. Wow. We can agree to disagree. I thought that was an excellent game.

Oh my God, I love you. Yeah, it does not get enough love because it was the first Neversoft one, right? And everyone was just like, ah, that, you know, it's now this is like the Arkham Origins of the the whole thing. It's like, nah, man, this **** was so good. And it felt tighter than the other ones.

What are you gonna pick? I don't know. That's my problems. I don't think that I have a Mario Kart that I would stick to as being the best.

My Crash Team Racing, I got to give the shout out to because I heard that Mario Kart this superior kart racing. But in terms of Mario Kart, I think I might give it to 8.

Like Double Dash, it feels broken because of the the characters being tied to items. There was something about 8 that there was multiple characters with the same stats that you can use. Yeah, it's a lot more fair. And again, the polish is just great. The music is awesome. It looks amazing. I'm and Switch. Yes, I mean, that's the thing is I'm you probably aren't wrong.

Reason why they're a controlled substance. But for the people who, you know, are your fans who maybe don't know, my husband John Drake works for PlayStation. He at PAX East at PAX Amania ruptured his Achilles, which is quite a brutal injury. And it was weird. He was just jumping up and down. He wasn't even like he was making contact with",

He wasn't even like he was making contact with another player or anything. And we had to go to the emergency room in Boston. And the the doctor immediately was like, yep, your Achilles has detached. Sorry. Basically, like the test is like, so you lay down and then they squeeze the calf muscle of your non-injured leg and your foot moves like a reflex test. And then they squeeze the calves on his injured leg and there was no movement. And to like, that's not good. Good. Next, right? Yep, it's fully ruptured. Oh my God. So, um, he had to have surgery, reconstructive surgery to get it fixed. So he is now in his walking casts and on the road to recovery. And hopefully will have his boot off by E3.
