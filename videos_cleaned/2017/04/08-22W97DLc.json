I think that they are in the worst spot out of out of the big three in terms of E3 press conferences, in terms of their success, in terms of what they have. They I think when isse now do we know Monday night historically? Yeah, Monday night is is Microsoft's now Sunday night. Sunday night and then Nintendo is predictably well no it's Microsoft uh Sunday afternoon Bethesda Sunday night didn't someone go into Saturday even did I see or is it Sunday doing their EA play thing then it's going to be the normal",
