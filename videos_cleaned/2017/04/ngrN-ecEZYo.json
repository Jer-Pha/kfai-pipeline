I'm well, how are you? I had to buy a shirt at a Vanessa Carlton concert last night to make sure for like the fourth day in a row we didn't wear the same shirt. I appreciate that. We need some level, some app that can just, we can check in with the shirt that we're wearing, all something like that. Yeah, that was, but I don't want to text you all the time. I don't want to bother you. I just want to, I want to log on at like 8:30, 9:00 in the morning when I'm, when I'm putting my shirt on and, and be able to see what shirt is going on. Maybe we just need to do just Instagram post every day, every day, every day this, or you get that program software that uh, Cher had in Clueless and just hook that up all your shirts. I, we don't even have a network computers here, you know what I mean? We don't even have a shared server. Instagram it is. Yeah, over",

Are you a Bachelor fan? No, you're missing out on some greatness. We all know Corinne got robbed. I'm sure. I don't know if we do know that, but we'll find her again on Paradise. Will she find love? Oh Jesus, I hope so. I was looking at the wrong camera for all, for the sake of love and rounding off the group. She works at GameSpot. I do. She dressed as a piece of pizza.

No, I knew that you were cool. Don't rub people's faces unless they ask you to do that. We've talked about this before. Now here's something I want to up.

I, he's the SoCal guy, so that's where I think, I think the sandals still come from. So in Orange County, it's acceptable to go out at night because it's still warm in jeans, 'cause you don't want to go to a restaurant in shorts, but you want your feet to be aired out, so you, you wear the, yeah, the any second.

Oh, for who's the best boy, boy band? Who is the ultimate boy band? So this topic is a long time coming. A couple weeks ago, I tweeted out, I was like, what should we talk about? GameOverGreggy Show. You responded. I said Backstreet Boys versus NSYNC. And I was like, we need to wait. We need to get you on the show to settle this debate because there's nobody more qualified than you to be here.

You're going to see things that we wouldn't pick up at on at all, I guess. No, I'm just, I was just a really huge fan. I feel like the answer is just NSYNC and this topic's over. So here's the thing, Greg, you would be right. There's debate. There's, thank you, Kevin. I'm divided. I'm divided. I was more of an NSYNC fan for a longer amount of time, but I was initially a Backstreet Boys fan. And I have this to say, looking back, I think that Backstreet Boys' songs hold up better.

Most of the album of No Strings Attached does not hold up as much like especially all the B-sides. Like here at the end of the day, the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, that for all their similarities, they're very different. And I think that there's a lot of classes that you need to kind of have the debate between. On one hand, there is dancing. Who's better at dancing? NSYNC, insane, undenied. Who's better at presentation stuff? NSYNC. That's all that they have. But Backstreet Boys, they harmonize, which means their music does hold up better. NSYNC has the hits.

I just assume everything else is either Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, or what, whatever the other. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I remember nobody liked, not like the thing with Backstreet Boys and NSYNC is if it was a ballad, it's probably Backstreet Boys with a couple rare exceptions like Gone, This I Promise You. The Christmas music, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays. That is the Christmas jam. I must say, NSYNC one Christmas, one Christmas. But Backstreet Boys never put a full-fledged Christmas album. Yeah, they were too busy putting out eight other albums that no one cared about. Did you ever see the um, the, the NSYNC HBO concert that they put on? Of course. Holy crap. Fantastic.

And I feel like there's a stigma to boy bands that at the time, and maybe still is, that you're, you're a boy in high school. You can't enjoy this kind of music. You know what I mean?

Uh, I thought it looked fine like Prometheus but I don't know hopefully they learned from that experience. Hopefully that's the case. So right like this is kind of the spiritual successor to that in that I mean it's kind of a direct sequel I think but also that they're um they're trying to kind of redo what they didn't do in Prometheus.

We had uh Idris Elba and Charlize Theron in uh in Prometheus and I was like I love those two but they were highly underutilized. Noomi Rapace is great but everyone else in the cast I was like I don't really know who these people are and Michael Fassbender I guess Fassbender was good too. I guess I'm just talking about the characters that you're not really supposed to know who they are so maybe I'm talking out of my ass right now but I didn't feel like there was anything was in it.

Yeah, because the the medium is completely different but just the visualization of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World like it's it's a really cute book but like when you're watching it just like the transitions he does and just bringing a comic to life and just like this it just slides from one scene to the other.

So it is a movie about you know a driver for criminal organization. He's super young. He's got some weird ear thing where he has to listen to music the entire time. I forget that otherwise it's ringing or something. I haven't seen the trailer in a while. I saw the trailer. I was like I'm in and I kind of forgot about. He keeps hearing a ringing sound.
