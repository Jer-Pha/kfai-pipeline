And then they all talked to each other and realized that like they were the problem where, oh, I bought it digitally and with a collector's edition. You can see how it all happens where it all starts stacking up. Perhaps telling.

Last night, I saw uh friend of the show, Nick Chester, over at Epic. He tweeted out the photo of his that he bought the Wii or he bought the Switch, but he didn't buy any games. I assume he's waiting for Mario Kart. I don't know. Or he just wanted to have it to have. Oh, yeah, I saw that. And it was like, okay, but it was like, that's the where we're at right now. Oh, ****. There it is. Got to get it. Got it. Put it there. You know what I mean? Yeah, man. But so 10 million, can we go back to",

But so 10 million, can we go back to that story real quick? I never left it. Is it 10 million more or total 10 million by the I believe it's total. Nintendo expects to sell 10 million units of Switch hardware in the next year. Oh, so I guess so. I don't know. The phrasing of that's interesting. Yeah, I think they're saying from here out out 10 more. Either way, if it were to sell 10 million a year, I think that I think they're saying from here on out 10 more because they're saying it would come close to outselling the Wii U's 13.56. That was the point I was. So that'd be 1.74 or whatever. Yeah. So in one year, this thing is projected to crush the Wii U to hit what the Wii U did in its entire lifetime. Yeah, that is great news.

And I this news makes me so happy because we're starting to get to a point where that number is impressive enough. The Nintendo can start to lay off the 3DS and you know, start committing to this as more of its sole platform. Let me jump. Let me read a little more of the stats here because they go past the Switch. Uh, the Wii U itself is not faired well, selling just uh 760,000 units as it ceases production alongside software sales of 14.8 million units. As for Zelda on Wii U, the game has so far sold 1.08 million units, bringing it up to 3.84 million units across the platforms. It's been a good year for the 3DS, however, as sales of hardware grew 7% year on year, shifting seven I'm yeah, shifting uh 7.7 million units. There are Nintendo Switches available on",

I stop reading yet, or is this interesting stuff? This is a boring story about boring people. No, fuck you. Did you see the Cars trailer yesterday? That shit is hype as fuck. Cars 3 sucks dick. Cars One, underrated. Damn, Tim. What? I mean, just Cars 2 might not have been for you, but no, Cars 2 sucked. Actually, never watched it. It's bad. But Cars 3 looks so good.
