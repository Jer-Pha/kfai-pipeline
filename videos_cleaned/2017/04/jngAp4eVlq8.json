Where do people go for coffee in San Francisco? All right, there are a couple of really great places. There's Ritual Coffee, um, and they have a bunch of shops around the city. Four Barrel is one of my favorite places and that's in uh, Mission and Mazarine. That's where you'll see Hunter and I just because it's closer. Yeah, Mazarine. It's on Market Street.

But the problem is always, I find the Invincible stuff, I love it, I try to do it, and then people don't, people don't get motivated to watch it. Yep, so I got to wait, strike when the iron's hot.
