It's been waging, but I want to start a war at this table. Okay, do pineapples belong on pizza? Yeah, this debate again? Yes. Oh, ****, we're already starting with the G be just Dr like that. What do you fall down on this, Greg? Now it's a complicated question. It's a multiac question. The question is, do pineapples belong on pizza? I of course am part of whatever gets you. Yeah, let your freak flag fly. If you want pineapple on your pizza, if you want live mouse on your pizza, that's your choice and I'm not going to get in the way of it. Would I put a pineapple on a pizza? No, I would not ever. I I don't no, no, none of this Hawaiian style. I'm going to get it. I love Canadian bacon. I love Canadian bacon, but I I like with some pepperoni. That's right, more salt and meat. What do I care? I enjoy pineapples on pizza. I don't say that they belong there. I enjoy them.

He says yes. Troy Baker no no pineapple. My God, was did I miss them other my apologies. Yeah, so this is this is a whole thing. I for me, I've always stood that I like Hawaiian pizza. To me, I'm like that belongs in the world. It is not what I think of when I think pizza. Sure, so does it belong on pizza?

There's pepperoni obviously as an option. Sausage is an option, just cheese as an option, whatever. Hawaiian is its own kind of sub genre that I feel totally deserves a place at the table. Sure, everyone's just going to understand that it's going to be the least grabbed exactly more for me, but exactly. And the way I see it is I kind of look at it as a dessert. It's a mini dessert pizza, a little bit of sweet to it. Yeah, you have a couple slices of your other ****. I feel like you have opinions on this. I think I just figured out why I don't like Hawaiian so much because at pizza parties was I the guy that came back to have a couple more slices when the party was done?
