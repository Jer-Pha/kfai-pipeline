Ghost Burglar wants to know, hey, what's up with your endless love and passion for Mario Sunshine? We talked about it a little bit earlier. Why would do this to me? So like, I mean, do you have beef with this game? So I don't know, have beef. I mean, the beef I have now is that uh just all the feedback I get for not liking the game. I mean, it's just, I mean, I'm a huge Mario fan, so when I play Mario Sunshine, like the the successor to Mario 64, the first Mario game on GameCube, and it I didn't think it was very good. Feel like a Mario game. It just felt like, all right, I have this weird, it's not a bad game, you know. I called Last Topic, I said it sucked. It doesn't suck, but it's like it doesn't feel like a Mario game. It feels like I'm Mario in somebody else's game and I'm doing Mario-y things. That's weird to me because",

That's weird to me because to me it does feel like a Mario game because to me a Mario game just means it feels very tight. Everything I do feels like it's happening on screen when I'm doing it with the controller and I think that FLUDD controlled well. Uh, I think the mechanics of having to constantly refill your water sucked. Like I think like they could have uh changed that up a bit and I think that the level designs got a little bit trite when it was the same kind of vacation feel for every single level and there was way uh less levels than there was in in even 64, half the amount. 64 had 15 and Sunshine had six, seven, I think six or seven. I mean like that's that's ridiculous 'cause even 64 didn't have that many levels, you know. Yeah, it's true. Um, it's Kevin's favorite Mario game. Yeah, but Kevin's an idiot. Yeah, it's true. Yeah.",

I had no fun with Paper Mario: Sticker Star. So yeah, yeah, I know the the thing that is interesting to me about Sunshine is Nintendo. The reason it feels like a Mario game to me and it feels like a Nintendo game is during the GameCube generation they just went **** bonkers, true.

And I was just like, holy ****, we're getting all three of these things. The first Metroid game since Super Metroid and it's a first-person shooter, question mark? Mar, yeah.

I'm not saying it was wasn't bad. It wasn't bad original. I mean, that's how I feel about Mario Sunshine, right? Like I get I like it when Nintendo does different stuff, but I also like that stuff to be really good. Mario Sunshine just didn't quite hit it for me. Like it did some things well. Mario himself controlled great. I thought the FLUDD controls I weren't I weren't too happy with. Um, but yeah, I think they miss mark in enough ways that it it disappointed me.

Well, I mean, people are just like, oh, there was like in the January presentation for Nintendo, there was what, six seconds of Mario Odyssey footage made a 10-minute video. Not a genuine thing.

Like I mean, the thing the only thing that gets to me is when people like accused us of purposely making longer videos. It's like, are you kidding me? I hate making longer videos. Like the longer this is, the longer it takes me to make. I wish I could just crank these out like bust them right out. Yeah, make a four-minute video. That'd be awesome.

I look at Smash Bros., a layman, those games all look the same. If you play them, you can tell there are huge differences between them and you talk about those differences for a while. Exactly. And I, Smash Bros. obviously one of my favorite franchises of all time, but one of my favorite things about it is the hype train leading up to it. And I loved that for both Melee, or not Melee, for Brawl and for the the Wii U and 3DS one. They would do the thing where every night, every weeknight, you got something new. And in Brawl it was way more like it was always a new feature or a new character or something. For the Wii U and 3DS ones, it was always a screenshot. Once a day you get a",

And there's so much to go through where it's like, here's this item which is from this game and here's what we think it might do. And it's like that shit's so interesting to me. So I think you're doing God's work. Do I? I appreciate that. What a surprise, people on the internet want to tear on something someone else makes. What? Let's see here. Um, already kind of talked about that. So this is an interesting question that uh we keep being asked. I'm just going to keep asking until a guest has an opinion about it.

Every every time we have a guest, he asks about Armored Core. He just wants he just want someone to care about Armored Core. I I used to always say More Saeyan like uh like he's going Super Saeyan. Super. So I've been saying Saeyan wrong. I hate you so much. Yes, I mean, it kind of sounds cooler though. But that's from Pok\u00e9mon, right? When you hit the when Charizard hits the level Charizard. So speaking of Pok\u00e9mon, we we missed this a couple of topics ago. When do you think what do you think the next Pok\u00e9mon game is going to be after Stars? Oh, after Stars? Um, I think it's going to be the uh the reboot of what it, fourth gen now?

You don't want that? We just got Sun and Moon. Like I know that's the problem though, is like I feel like there needs to be a turn. I they need to do something and there needs to be a turnaround. And I think that I know that this is the most Gamer-y thing to possibly **** say, but like I really think that they should make Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue 2. And it should be a Pok\u00e9mon game. It should be what people want, you know. Not the MMO, I think that's a little too ambitious. But give them the a real console Pok\u00e9mon game and make it as familiar to the most people as possible.

I think that instead of like constantly remaking the gens, they could go forever for that, right? It's just the cycle. I do think that they need to just go back to what the most people care about. Pok\u00e9mon Go is a perfect example of that. And I think that even if it was getting it back to the 151, I don't think that that's that bad of an idea, you know. I I man, I'm gonna come across this to Gen 1 or now too. Like I'm I'm with you. Like I'm actually not that big of a Pok\u00e9mon guy. I I love Gen 1. I play the **** out of that in school.

Like I don't know if I want to do this anymore. Like this is just work at this point. Catch all this freaking Pok\u00e9mon. Um, and it's almost daunting at this point now. Like there's what, 700 Pok\u00e9mon, more, maybe more. Uh, so I think maybe kind of rebooting it in a way, going back to Red and Blue Kanto, making it for a console, like full 3D, like just re-envision that world. Like almost like the anime, right? Like blow it up. That I mean, I'd be on board with that. I I just I think that that would be, I mean, Pok\u00e9mon's fine. Like they don't need my advice on on how to sell their games.

Like, you know, I'm going Super Saeyan. Yeah, so much Saeyan. You are kind of right though. Like coming following up with that after Pok\u00e9mon Go, like now's the time to do it. Like you want to bring back that that market he just expanded into. Bring them back with a remake of the originals. But I mean, let's be real here. I I don't think a remake of the originals. I think a reboot. They've already remade remade. I do think that it'd be a little egregious if they did it again. Yeah, I mean, what they I mean, it doesn't matter though.

The perfect console for like the one game that was made for the GamePad. The one game instead that is Star Fox Zero. Instead, Star Fox Zero is a GamePad game. Like that that is it's the most upsetting to me ever because Star Fox 64 is one of my top games of all time. I **** love that franchise. Um, Star Fox Assault, despite its flaws, the on-rail things were freaking awesome. It has some awesome ideas and the story of it for Star Fox, I loved it. It was it felt like a sequel to 64. And then they just kept going off the deep end with all of the **** ****. And then with Zero, I'm like, we're finally getting a Star Fox in the Wii U.

Like the Wii came out with Wii Sports that showed off how the Wii Remote was used. And it was like, okay, cool, good for you guys, right? The Wii just never like know what to do with it. It is kind of interesting that Ubisoft probably had a better grasp than how to use it Nintendo. Um, no, dude, I'm with you, man. Like I I mean, I feel like I want to say they should reboot Star Fox, but that's literally what they've done like three times now. Like I don't know what they do with Star Fox.

I don't know what you can say how it did for the Wii U, but I mean, the Wii U obviously didn't do well, so I don't think they could trickle out again to the same degree.

So then then we would be getting into that territory of they would have to announce Smash. They'd have to announce that the USB adapter from Smash is compatible with the um Switch, which it should be. Yeah, but what what gets complicated with that is is plugging.
