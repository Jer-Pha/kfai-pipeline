Yeah, because clearly they were taking a a cue from our design aesthetic. Mhm mhm. And I don't mind that. Um, the thing is, it's just an interesting choice from Nintendo right now. It's a dumb choice because they just released what many are assuming as pretty much a handheld, right? Well, I mean, that's the problem is they're trying to not push it that way. They're trying to push it as their console. They want people to think of, here's the deep library, close to vast library. I just want to say someone out there, Nintendo fan of the show, yeah, super fan of the show, there is a deep library.

Got it. 'Cause Virtual Console at E3, I mean, I'll take it over nothing, but I feel like that's like better suited in a Direct that can be more technical and like focus on just that. I want E3 to be about announcements. Yeah, Virtual Console is not an announcement. No, but to them it is. Uh, Omega Batman says, \"Nick, have you watched any Hulu original series?
