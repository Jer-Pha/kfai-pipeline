You have like whatever it was, 10 hour, five hours, something like that. Yeah, I'm what, 15 or 17 in now. Okay. Yeah, so percentage-wise, what does that mean? Nothing. That's Jeff. That's terrible. I've done one Palace. I finished off one Palace, which is the, you know, the main dungeons. And it got introduced to Mementos, which is like the ever-changing, the old-school dungeons. We'll talk about it. It's a grinding dump. Yeah. What did it sort of like that thing of like when we're searching for the next guy we got to take down, who's harder, we steal next.

I guess done game across two languages. Yeah, I have it platinum doing English and Japanese. So I started in Japanese when it came out in September. And I was like, I'm gonna play a little bit and get used to the combat. And I'd beat it. How hard was that if you don't speak Japanese? There's no English. A little hard. Yeah, there's, I mean, thankfully, a lot of the menus are in English. So it, yeah, what I was doing, I knew what I was doing as far as what I was selecting parent category wise in the menus. Okay. And then I'm your host save. And then for like recovery items, HP and SP or Robbie. But yeah, like that stuff, I was pretty good on that. Um, it was harder.

So it was a, it was a lot of that. The harder were you taking copious notes to impossibly complicated notes? I would. To the point where if I found an item I needed, I would take a picture with my phone and then like essentially like copy the Japanese characters by hand and and I had like a Photoshop doc that was like, this one equals revived, this one equals whatever. Yeah, a little weird. Sort of what about the stories to have English subtitles in it? Not in the Japanese version. They're loud. They might have added it now. But that was my thing.

I don't know. It's telling me that sigh. I talked to every single person and tried every single door to figure out what it wanted. And that's a cola. This is endlessly impressive today. Like when I was in other word, it is the most impressive thing I've ever done in my life is I beat Pokemon Silver when I I had it imported when I was in third grade and it was Japanese and I beat the game. Ooh. At this point, I don't know how I did that. I could barely read English in third grade on how hell I did that. But it was the same thing of just kind of figuring I well, this squiggly line throws the Pok\u00e9 Ball. So I figure that out. The Pokemon doesn't really have a story.

I just don't understand how you could play a game that like where the story like actually matters. It's weird because I I kind of understood. I keep relating it to like when you're at a bar or restaurant and the movie's on on mute. Sure. And you can look up at it and like if someone gets shot in the head, you understand it. That guy got shot in the head. They're not going to know why. Or like a good example of BioShock. If you were to play BioShock not understanding, you would, spoilers for BioShock, sorry, I was just about to put it. You would know when Andrew Ryan gets clubbed to death, but you're not gonna understand, would you kindly? And you're sure to get like the context of the moment. So that was that was it for me.

So I was like, oh, like that's why he hates that. How many times playing the English version were you like, man, I'm I was so stupid to thing like 50. Yeah, there were so many one which I was like, oh, like that's why I'm fighting this dude. Yeah, yeah. So weird. So my question comes down to on this is that you get American English version. You go through and platinum this. How long does that take? Well, that was weird because I like puzzle solutions. I basically remembered and I had a lot of like notes written down. So like a lot of that stuff worked. I would say you're on 110 hours. Damn it. Which is like surprisingly fast to get that because the story itself probably takes 80 to",

Um, so outside 110, 120, it's a little hard because the the way I do it and I have some like trophy tips I can give or whatever. But like hotcakes, if you have, if you keep a save on November 5th, that's the longest stretch of free time you'll get in the game. And so I even after I beat the game, I then would reload that save in just morning, noon and night, just read books for two weeks. We have that movie more like morning night, play games to get that trophy or go fishing to get that trophy. So like I kept reloading the same save for that stuff. Gosh. And so like my play count, my play timer like isn't exactly accurate. Gosh. It okay, okay. Do you like this game? No, it's really bad. What if I did play English? I'm like, oh,",

What if I did play English? I'm like, oh, no. Oh my God. Isn't horrible. For the question for me as somebody that's never played a Persona game at all. Two questions. One is just a good jumping in point. And two, how does this compare to the other ones? I think it's absolutely a good talking point because I there's no, there's like some Easter egg relations and some things that sort of carry over. But it's like like a Final Fantasy, like new story, a new characters, all that stuff. So totally good place to jump in. Um, systems wise, like battle eyes, it is by far the best. In the same way that, uh, if you play, because I started actually my first Persona game that I like really played through, it was Persona 4 Golden.

And so here we are and it's like, it's your sylphs s with it. But you reviewed it and you know everything about this. And I'm still so young in the game and every everything I'm like, and more if the cat turns into a call. Really? I'm like so excited about all those crazy shows happening. It's funny because you know how like a, I'm sure you guys have this too. There's always like someone who recommends a thing to you and they're like, you would love this.

And then yeah, when when we got Golden, God, did I just hit the perfect like every note for me. And I I got like really into it. And then I tried to go back to Persona 3 Portable after and it definitely you felt like that it was like aged a little. Yeah, like I loved that. I actually liked the characters from better in Persona 3. I like the story a lot. But for sure, like the systems feel a little worse than Golden. Um, so far jumping on point like 5 totally makes Golden feel that way now. Like for the review, I went back and played a little of P4 and I was like, oh no, like I love my little anger. But it's like so hard to go back to now. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's I mean, for me, you know, jumping in the Persona 5, it is that",

But it is of like, oh yeah, this is Persona. This is what I remember Persona 4 doing. You go back, oh no, this is not what Persona 4 look like or felt like or it is those systems. But it is the fact that I was telling Kevin, I think earlier today or somebody else, maybe Nick, about the fact that as far as if you loved it, as far as a jumping in point though, the fact I feel like Persona 5, even though I've played what I started with 3, then reviewed Portable, then reviewed Golden, the fact that the systems are being explained even better here where I feel like I'm jumping in and this is why I recommended it to jumping in point of like, you get into this and it's not just like, oh, you should how to do",

Yeah, it's really tutorial heavy, but in a good way because I feel like it would be totally overwhelming if it wasn't. Right. Like it kind of needs to be handholdy. And it's also like when I was playing through it, especially after having played in Japanese, like some tutorials like, oh God, I wish I could skip these. But then, you know, there is stuff like even if you played Persona 3 and for front to back and you're obsessed with them, have done everything. Like there's still stuff like ranged weapons and negotiation better actually going back to like Persona 2. And that's the thing is for me starting with 3, I never knew about those. And",

I've got because I feel like I've been there so long. I was reviewing the stuff on PS IGN team. You know what I mean? Yeah, it's crazy. It's weird. This is yeah, like I would feel like I feel like because I really where am I sleeve and I literally found a shirt like I love Series in it like means a lot to me. But I'm totally like a late like he's like a bandwagon fan because I jumped in it Golden. Sure. And so like I've gone back and played. I didn't beaten Persona 1. I've only played one of the Persona 2s. Like I'm not as well versed as I should be on like the old school stuff. But I do really appreciate watching the series evolve for sure.",

But it's not for 0 years. Yeah. So it really does have like, like there's a Shin Megami Tensei universe Virtual Boy game. And it's like so insane. It's been around on. Yeah, yeah. Jack Bros. on Virtual Boy, which is like so weird to think about. And like Persona 1 is a Persona 1 game. Like it just it's crazy they'd have that legacy. So I think in that way, like this does feel like the culmination of like everything it's been building too. Sure. But it's also for me the the improvements they've made to it where it is like, okay, I haven't played it for a while. But the platforming around chandeliers",

Like they're doing so many interesting cinematic touches that are really like, I you know, Persona 4 Golden nail it so much in terms of like, ah, here's characters you care about. And this really is the presentation of all the information. Yeah, I think that's where it's like the easiest way to explain why it's better is that, um, the dungeons in Persona 4 are visually themed, but they're still essentially the same thing. They're randomly generated hallways and you're working your way up and up and up and maybe there's a room with some treasure or an enemy. But you're basically doing the same thing. These aren't that. These are hand built like defined dungeons. Yeah, they all have different puzzle types that like literally feel like",

Yeah, they all have different puzzle types that like literally feel like different games. Like it's completely different. And then if you want the grinding, if you want that like randomly generated, that's Mementos we were talking about. So and that's such a nice throwback to it because that is the thing of when I was going on, you know, I've so I polished off one Palace. I've gotten into Mementos. I haven't even started the second Palace yet, which is dungeon. And being in that first one, it was like, oh man, how this is so different. And they first it was a thing of like, what is different about it? Like, oh right, like Persona 4 the way they randomly generated in Persona 3. Right. It was like, that's fine. But it got so much this. Yeah, once I got in and I was like, oh my God, like 3 Days World with strip club laughs. Cool. But then it wasn't like I was another always be on",

It is like there's the dungeons on the, you know, then there's the nice things, the chandeliers, the secret passages. How do you get through this wall? Yeah, puzzle. Yeah, it's really crazy. And even especially as you get further, like they get more complicated. They get more, they get bigger. Like the scale of them get so much bigger. I don't know. I'm just so impressive. Like the scope of this game and how much it has because everything we're talking about right now is battle and like dungeons and all that. And that's half the game. That's not even counting how big Tokyo is and how like have distinct like Shibuya and Shinjuku and Akihabara feel. And like just how accurate it feels to Japan.

Like what I keep saying is last year and end this year, you look at like Zelda or Final Fantasy and their big thing is breaking conventions. Right. Like Zelda rethought everything and Final Fantasy like totally took away turn-based combat and made it much more action-oriented and made it kind of Western influence. And like that is awesome. And that really helps those games. And I think like in a lot of ways, it made them more approachable and things like that. Persona take the takes the exact opposite approach. It is leaning so hard into a genre and leaning so hard into kind of like what its built in the previous versions that like for me, it is easily the best turn-based RPG of 10 0 years. Like going back to that like SNES era because they could possibly compare to Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VI or the things",

But I don't know that anything has felt turn-based why's this good since then at least like PS era. Like it like it's been a while since something feels disliked genre-defining in that way. Right. And then a thing of like what you're talking about. I think when, you know, for me with Persona, it is Omega. What's next? Done. You're gonna look like and who's this next character? And you know, Mementos. Like we know who am I going after? Whatever. But like it's the old Persona trope of like, all right, you're back in your room. It's like, oh cool. Kind. I can't leave. But why don't you just put me to bed? Why why do you make me go to bed? Just, you know what I mean? But like not other cat like stopped me from going out. I'm like, what the why am I?

Like that is where this game gets even cooler because the but on four different social links are called can even change some of that. Like they can give you extra free time.
