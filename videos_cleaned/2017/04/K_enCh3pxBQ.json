So I worked with you for 5 years, give or take a little bit. Yeah, you were there the whole time I was there, weren't you? Well, I mean, I left. So I worked with you from what, like probably 2010 to 2014. Oh, okay. So, sh*t, I was way off. Well, 'cause then I left.",

Oh, so you were there for me. Yeah, 'cause I started as contract in like August of 2011 and then I became full-time in October of 2011 and then um, I was there until February 2014. Left for 14 months, 13 months, came back in May of 2015. So you were doing news. Yeah, then you came back to run news. Yes. Yeah. So what does all that mean and what does news mean at IGN? So we have uh, we divide things. A long time ago we had content teams like divided by the content type. So PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, uh, all that. And then now we did it instead by rather than content and in terms of manufacturer, we have it by content like previews, reviews, news, features, um, are kind of our four.",

And then now we did it instead by rather than content and in terms of manufacturer, we have it by content like previews, reviews, news, features, um, are kind of our four big verticals, uh, and so I run the news part of that, um, Executive Editor of News. And then I have a counterpart for previews, reviews, and features. So with when you, when you, you being in charge of news, is that news in terms of article and video? Sort of. So it's like news is like this weird foundation where um, yeah, like we, like I oversee the news video team and then The Fix is sort of separate from me, but I still work with those guys a lot. Um, and I guess if The Fix has like a huge mistake or problem, that's probably ultimately on me. But like we basically do it as um, yeah, like announcements, press release, you know, blasts, things like that. And things announced during press conferences are all news. And then we consider there's this gray area that other sites call report, which is sort of a newsy feature, which uh,",

So for people out there that read video game news every day, they go to the IGN's, the GameSpots, wherever, or Kotaku and like kind of just read through all the articles that that were written. That's where they get all of that. Where do you get the news? Uh, mostly directly from publishers. Like we're obviously getting press releases and and you know, every morning checking PlayStation Blog, Ubisoft Blog, like all that stuff for announcements that go wide. And then other things that we get exclusively that we either negotiate for or pitch for or that come out of um, you know, IGN First. Maybe we go somewhere to see a game.",

Maybe we go somewhere to see a game and then while we're there, they're like, oh, by the way, we just started working the sequel. And then we have a story like that. It's kind of news is a weird thing because it's unpredictable, right? So like there's no, I come in with like 10 things I'm expecting to do that day, but then if there's a major announcement like um, surprise, we announced a sequel or you know, really unpredictable things like, you know, a death or, you know, a major person um, leaving a company or things like that. We kind of have to stay on our toes. So I think um, where do I get the news? Kind of from everywhere. I am constantly looking at Twitter, looking at Facebook, uh, reading through blogs, looking at my inbox. We get tips from people. Uh, it kind of comes from everywhere and it's sort of uh, sort of feels like a little overwhelming at.",

Like kind of looking down the barrel of that gun and and thinking about like kind of the triage of like in the moment, like what is the most important thing and what are we focusing on? Um, and all of that is just sort of the aggregation side of it. And then there's also the generating original news. So the conducting interviews and being proactive about if someone does announce something, how how are we following up and and who are we in the phone with to be like, well, what else can we get out of this? And and where what is the, okay, so this is what you said in the press release. What did you not say? You know, what are our questions still? It's stuff like that. So it can be a little daunting, but there's there's a lot to it. So NeoGAF is kind of the the biggest video game website where I'd say the.",

Oh yeah, Reddit as well. But they they're kind of doing all the work themselves because they they want to be doing it. How often do you does IGN get new stories from NeoGAF? Well, I mean, I would say like the experiential things like uh, so you know, whatever uh, why can I not think of a multiplayer game? But Call of Duty launches and uh, like there server problems or there's, oh my God, if you if you choose this obscure combination of classes, like you actually can't connect, but everybody else can or things like that. Like the things that only come from gameplay, that is where Reddit and NeoGAF are incredible because they just by virtue of the volume of people are going to encounter things that we might.",

Like, you know, we're we're if we're doing our jobs right or seeing that at the same time they are. So if a NeoGAF thread pops up, a lot of the time it's like, oh, like Mass Effect Andromeda has been delayed. We might have known that under embargo from EA. We might have just seen the blog post at the same time they did or the Tweet or wherever the source was. Or maybe it was even said on our show or maybe it was set on a GameSpot show. And so we have to source that. Like I think GAF just kind of has wider set of eyes than we do. But uh, for the most part, like I would say it's rare for us to find out something from them than than the opposite. So you mentioned getting tips earlier. How often does that happen?

Um, or I have my DMs open and that's a lot of the like um, you know, hey, I work at GameStop and we heard about this or or hey, like I just got laid off in this publisher and like we were at the time doing this and I'm really frustrated. Like we'd love to show it off and stuff like that. And I I think we've we're doing a little less of that than I think we were when I was more in the trenches. Um, it it's something I want to kind of get back to. Like I think like the Jason Schreiers and Patrick Klepeks of the world are so, they are dedicating so much more time and resources, but they're also just better at sniffing for that stuff. And so like they have a lot of like really cool scoops and things that I feel like um, we still love to get when we can, but.",

Um, but that stuff, yeah, it'll come from yeah, like fans of the shows who who, you know, because they know us and like us will decide to share something with us or people who are devs or people who just tell us things in confidence that we're not necessarily reporting on, but but that we can kind of keep kind of in our back pockets and that we know and that provide context for other announcements and things like that. How do you kind of balance that like the ethics of reporting the news, but also not betraying the friendships you have? Like specifically you're talking about like, oh, if you were to go to an IGN First or something and you find something else there, do you run that stuff by them before you write the news article? It would depend. I mean, like if they invite.",

But in different circumstances, like if we find out something that, you know, an ex-employee tells us or or someone, you know, their sister works there and told them something or whatever, like we'll verify that information, but maybe it is something that we run that maybe the publisher wasn't ready to announce or, you know, like way back in the day, uh, we heard about the Telltale Game of Thrones game before Telltale had announced it at the VGAs that year. And we, you know, double confirmed it, made sure it was real. And then we ran that news ahead of time. Like occasionally I think that can make uh, publishers mad or or, you know, like you you hear Jason from Kotaku talking.",

I think it's it's kind of a balance, right? It's kind of like how important do we feel that information is? How confident are we that it's legit before we, you know, run it and hurt our own reputation or mislead our audience or or things like that? Where do you come down on the ethics of leaks? I think whenever we talk about a story on the morning show of this is, you know, Destiny's leaked or whatever, blah, blah. There's rumor, there's not rumors, there's comments of like, oh, this sucks for those people. And not even Destiny, 'cause that's just whatever, a GameStop, you're ahead by a few days. But when it is like that time that guy snuck in, just walked into an office and like walked up and ate lunch and like.",

I forget what game that was. It was up North. But like, yeah, or all the Kotaku Assassin's Creed reveals and things like that. That I mean, like ethics is a word worth for it, right? Like I don't, I think if you like stole it, if someone like hacked into a network and and illegally got it or something, that's not great. Um, I think there are a lot of reasons people do it. Like for example, like, and I was like very briefly and in a marketing capacity on the dev side. So it's like, it's weird for me because like I've seen how hard people work on things that we take for granted. How a texture that you probably walked by and didn't notice might have been 3 months of someone's life that they didn't have dinner with their kids and that they, you know, like really.",

And so I get why sometimes that's at odds with maybe the PR plan for a game. And if you're a dev who worked really hard on something and then it's not going to be announced for another year and you're like, oh, I just want out in the world. Like I get why people would be motivated to talk to the press and would put that out there. Um, I think when when they introduce that stuff to us, if they bring it to us and we verify that it's real, I don't consider it unethical. I think it's our jobs. You know, if we know that information and we're positive it's true and we think our audience will find it interesting, like I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing to put out there because like my job isn't to maintain Ubisoft's PR plan. Not what I do. Um, that said, I I do think there's like this.",

Like it like it made me feel like the most awful person to be like, you put this out there and you weren't supposed to and I put it on sh*t IGN and now it's everywhere. And like that person, like we would have those situations where someone would be like, hey, can you take down the story? Like I wasn't supposed to say that. And it's like, no, the bottle on that one. Yeah. And so it's like a weird, yeah, I mean, I don't, you know, it's not like I like, yeah, got another one or something. Like it's not like I take pride in that, but it's also I don't necessarily consider it unethical to to draw attention to that information that was.",

Is it a fine line to walk to go from you're doing the leaks, this is what I mean, you confirm that it's real, but then like you said, you know, it is PR blasts from people. It is the, there are the connections. I mean, I it really it it has to be case-by-case, right? Because I feel like it's so if you put a blanket rule over it, I think it becomes a lot harder in situations like so like one of the weirdest things is like when like not even necessarily us, but like the press reports on layoffs and the people that company don't know yet. And it's stuff like that where I think those are where you get into really weird gray areas where like if you know that like the head of a company just left and things are looking bad or like if you if you were to hear about the Irrational layoffs before.",

But man, do to put those employees in a crappy position and man, do to put their bosses who were, you know, it's 9:56 and at 10:00 they were about to announce it, you know, like there's obviously always going to be areas like that that are complicated. Um, and I I think news is like, you know, I talk about coming in with a to-do list and then the nine things I thought I would do that way that day, I do 10 other things instead. I think in that same way, it is sort of we never know what's going to kind of fall into our lapse or or what we're going to figure out. And then it's kind of evaluating.",

And is it, you know, I do think that there's a point where like if you're really going to burn a bridge with it, like you better make sure you're right. 'Cause I I do think there have been plenty of embarrassing moments in in plenty of outlet histories where like they did get something wrong. And and I don't know, like I I think that puts you, it it in that way, I do think you have a responsibility to your audience to fact check and to verify and to make sure you're doing it right. So with the verification, like what does that even look like? So are there certain sources like I imagine PlayStation Blog and the Xbox Wire or whatever it's called? Oh, which are obviously official channel. And so if you get that, that's just cool. This is fact. We're running it. But what if it comes.",

We're running it. But what if it comes from any other source? What does the process look like? Yeah, an official channel, obviously, like I guess like the PlayStation Blog could get hacked or like a verified Twitter account can get hacked and you'll see stuff occasionally that like, oh, that's weird or they made a typo or whatever it is. Occasionally that stuff does happen. Um, if someone emails us and they're like, hey, I work at Nintendo and I have Metroid Prime 4 footage I want to show you. Like it then becomes like, okay, like prove it, you know, like like number one, like my priority is like I I want to see it and I want to talk to that person. I want to make sure they like, what do you have to show me? Like, let's look at it. But I want proof of that them being who they say they are.

And sometimes that's not even something we'll publish necessarily, but like we have to see like verify your employment and all of that. Separate from that, we then have to like someone giving us an asset is is hard because that's a harder thing to to verify. Then I think information someone tells you something, trying to find another source to verify that information is a little more straightforward as opposed to like showing someone a video and saying, is this real? Uh, it's a weird boat to be in though where you have to make sure like sometimes information will come out or someone will tell us something and then we want to verify it, but maybe both of those people we're talking to are getting their information secondhand and maybe they're even getting it from the same person and that person misheard it in the first place.

And he tells you, but then separately he tells Greg and then you two are talking to each other and then you two are separately talking to me. Like it it's this weird game of telephone where like I think at this point, especially with like fake news and everything being what it is, I really I would air on the side of really like overly cautiously double-checking anything before I ran at this point if if it's not from something official. And I think it it puts us in a tough spot 'cause sometimes we hear about stuff early and then it gets announced and we're like, oh man, we knew that. Like we could have gotten that scoop.

And then and then, you know, you're dealing with the backlash of that. So talking about the official channels, like sometimes I've noticed even if it is an official channel, especially when you start looking at the worldwide uh, point of view of it all, like do you kind of take certain things as more credible than others? Like in terms of like an example I have is recent, recently the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, they still are being really coy on is it exclusive or is it not exclusive? And they haven't come out and actually set it. And then PlayStation, I don't know, Ireland or something tweeted um, like, oh no, Crash Bandicoot is exclusive to PlayStation.

It's hard because yeah, like I I say official sources, though everyone knows what that means. Like I think for me, there's definitely kind of this hierarchy, right? Where like the actual PlayStation Blog or the words coming out of Shawn Layden's mouth on stage during a press conference, you're good to go. Like something that is sent to us from Sony in a press release, you're good to report on that. Like those are generally going to be okay. A release date on Amazon or GameStop, maybe not as set in stone because a lot of those things are placeholders or a lot of those things are old info.

And then we have these uh, franchises that that are are international. So like there's IGN Benelux and and IGN France, IGN Hispania. And these companies that are, they're the IGN name and they're, you know, part of our global push. If we have an exclusive, we can put our stuff on all those sites at once. But their editorial staff operates autonomously and and doesn't like isn't dialed into us. I think that can be be true of PlayStation and Nintendo and everyone else that like what comes from, you know, PlayStation Ireland might not have come from the mothership or it might be a contracted social media agency that some customer service guy just thought it was.",

Where he's like, oh yeah, and Spider-Man's coming to PlayStation 4 this year. And and Asad's like, no, no, there's no release yet. And it's like, you from us having covered this, worked in this industry, you understand how that happens. That yep, Agent M, who's on every Marvel thing ever, yeah, he I'm sure he's not up to date on every Marvel video game release as well as the comics as well as this as well as the movies. Yeah, so the Amazon release date thing, so that happens all the time and most of the time it's like December 31st, whatever that year is. It's.",
