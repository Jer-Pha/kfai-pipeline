My final question is, I think, you know, since we do the morning show and go through the news and all this different stuff, there's often this battle cry, there's too much journalism or journalism, when are people going to do real video game journalism in the way you'd expect The Washington Post to cover whatever and blah",

And what I've noticed more and more with our industry as we, there are the, all right, PlayStation blogs put up this release date, sites are regurgitating that or re or posting that, regurgitating, they're putting that information out there, right? Because as as a consumer, I don't want to go to the every the Ubisoft blog and the PlayStation blog and this blog and that blog to cobble this all together. Yep. Then it's mixed in with what you're talking about, the scoops you're getting, that Jason Schreier is getting, that Patrick's getting. What I notice a lot is the fact that Deadline and Variety and all these other entertainment-based news outlets look a lot like our video game news outlets in the same way that I think, do you think that the future of video game journalism is more in that that that camp?",

So it's two, first of all, I guess I never really answered your journalism thing in the first place. So I guess I should say the biggest thing and and we are totally aware of that, right? The aggregation of the Reddits, the GAFs, all of that, and and trying to become more than just, hey, we're publishing the marketing materials for this, you know, like at a certain point, like if eight releases get announced on one day, the top eight stories in our site might all just be things that came directly from the publisher that you could find essentially anywhere. And so like to battle against that, one thing we're working on now is asking",

And so like to battle against that, one thing we're working on now is asking that question of, so what? And we're trying to do these more follow-up features of, okay, so Logan was number one in the box office this weekend, but like, what does that mean? And you know, like, how does that compare to other X-Men movies? And and what are the legs on it? And does opening weekend matter with inflation and all of that? Um, and then so with video game press releases, maybe we do get the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy thing, but it doesn't say where if it's exclusive. And that's the question we're asking is kind of enriching that story that way. So that's how we're fighting against that. Um, as far as like the future of games journalism, I think it's, um, we're at this weird precipice now where we, everything I just said about enriching that story, we have to do because I think ultimately like",

And like, maybe our audience right now might be bigger than the number of people who read the PlayStation blog, but the hardcore PlayStation crowd is still probably going to go directly to the source in a lot of cases. And so I think like, in order to keep game journalism going, I think it is the things that aren't necessarily subscribing to that PR drop mentality, which is, you know, the leaks and the scoops and things like that. But then it's also, if you are going to report on the the thing that people have put out there, what can you add to it? What can you, what interview can you get to a company that that is giving the",

So like when they announced the Castlevania Netflix series, Jonathan immediately talked to the showrunner and and got a little bit more on it, you know, and got a little bit more context. And I think those are the cases where I like our news product and I I feel like it's it's worth coming to. Um, I think the the journalism thing is a real concern and it's something that like, I think kind of left unchecked, it would be very easy for that to be the only thing we run. And I I think that would be bad. And I do think at that point it would be like, well, as a reader of the site, as a fan of the site, why am I coming here and not just going to Sony or Ubisoft? Well, I mean, I've always felt even when I was there that you got, it's such a, it's such a bad deal. It's such a bad look that you",

It's such a bad look that you can't help because I know firsthand from covering PlayStation for so long that there are gatekeepers. It can't be that I heard this about Naughty Dog and I go straight to Naughty Dog. You have to go to PlayStation to get to them to do that. And PlayStation will give you, we don't comment on rumors and speculation. So you get to that point like, well, why even go to this this this relationship doesn't work? So it's impossible to do real journalism if you're just getting cut off at the knees. And that's where it is. I'm going to speak on background. I'm going to speak off the record. I'm going to speak with a fake name. I'm going to give you, that's why the leaks are so prevalent because what was your fake name? My my fake name, Joe Scrabbles.

It's the only way to get any information out of these people that isn't PR approved, which gets so weird and weird. And that's why as you see more and more Indies start to do stuff that's interesting because those guys get to come out and speak with their mind on whatever they want. Do like like a Steve Gaynor or uh Sean Vanaman can just get up and talk about their game more openly. I think uh as people get, you know, like and those are interesting examples actually because you have these kind of high-profile Indie developers who are working with the big first parties. And so maybe they do have to, you know, keep an eye on what they can say. Like when you get a a fully true independent, like I can say whatever I want smaller game, I think you do tend to get more candid answers. Um, even like uh like we mentioned Dunham, like the interview he did here and the interview",

So yeah, so he did that interview with Colin a couple weeks ago. Kinda Funny, who has to listen to that? And like, who writes those art? Like, how how does that work? Like, do you just tell one of the contractors, hey, listen to this and write interesting things if we think news might come from it? Yeah, in the same way that like, I also do that with our own content. Like if if McAffrey does an episode of IGN Filtered, like we have someone who, oh, awesome, he's talking to Peter Molyneux and listens to that episode. And either McAffrey will say, hey, I think this will make a good headline, or that person, whether it's someone internal or a",

I think that should be a headline. And he'll run it by me and McAffrey and stuff like that. Um, so like, I just consume a lot of content in general. Like, I I the interviews that Colin did all during uh GDC were incredible. And actually everything we're talking about, like, please listen to the interview that Colin did with Jason from Kotaku because he like has much more to say and is is I think uh more articulate than I am, but also just like, I think is more in the trenches than I am at this point. Um, and he had so much great insight. I I super recommend that for anyone who's been interested in this rambling. Uh, but yeah, I I think it it's a complicated beast.

Can it get up by this date? Like, I think it's a little more of an exact science than news. I feel like news is a lot of checking your gut and uh really digging deep to make sure that like what you're running is is, you know, it's that balance between being accurate and being timely. And like, yeah, I can spend six months verifying something before I run it, but by the time I run it, it's probably old news. Or I'm, oh, it turns out Spider-Man is coming out September 1st and it's December, everyone knew that, you know. Uh, so I think like that doesn't, you know, I I don't want to wait so long that it's not topical anymore, but I also don't want to just rush into it and have that situation",

Um, and so I don't know, it can be hard. It can also be hard when you know one of our peers in the industry, like a competitor, in the same way that we have in the past, does break into Bargo by mistake. And then it is that awkward position where, well, crap, like all of us, you know, were waiting until this time on this day to report this news, but whoever it is went early. And then maybe we just source, hey, you know, Kinda Funny, it just revealed that blah, blah, blah happened. And yeah, we didn't do it. Wait, a Kevin, I know it's complicated.

It is crazy verifying things that you would just totally take for granted as like, you've seen it on Twitter and you're like, like watching you guys react to the Invincible news the other day is basically me a hundred times a day. So funny. I don't believe it. This can't be. And that's exactly what it is. It's like someone on Twitter or some, you know, someone on the other side of the office, like Jon Borba stands up and is like, hey, did you guys hear this? And I'm like, oh, what? And then like, we go through and like, maybe it ends up being BS. I'm like, oh, no, that's coming from this, you idiot, Boris. I don't know.

And we totally do get it wrong and we've run plenty of corrections. And then there are other times where I'm like very proud of the fact that we were first on something or very proud of the fact that like, we handled it well. So it's hard. That's awesome, man. I got a couple questions from the audience for you about news. No, just about other stuff. We'll find out there. This from Josh K. How was your time working for a Game Dev like Gearbox versus the press media like IGN? Uh, it was really educational. I mean, they, I make fun of Texas a lot, but like, I I still love the people of Gearbox. Like those people were great to me and it was a very like, I had like a very like familial feeling there because so many of them were older than me or, you know, married and had houses and I",

Um, I think I learned more about the process than I thought I would. Um, just kind of watching how many moving parts there are that go into something. And then by being on the side I was where I was hosting our panels and I was, um, doing a lot of like behind the scenes blog post and things like that. And like at the time we were going trying to ramp up a podcast and things like that. I was getting this sort of the same experience I had doing interviews for press except without that, oh, hey, we can't comment. I remember like without that barrier. So it was like conversations could go one step further than they ever had. And that was fascinating to me. Like just getting one-on-one time with people who were just like so smart.

Um, could not say enough nice things about like Randy Varnell, Aaron Lindy. Like there are just so many smart people there. Um, that taught me things I I never would have imagined about, you know, again, like I I use this as an example over and over, but like the amount of time that goes into like an animation loop or like into like making sure that like, hey, like this specific art asset is perfect or even like even down to things like working with publishers and and the strategy behind release timing and the strategy behind like when you're announcing something and how much you show and when that does leak and when that does get screwed up, how do you",

Um, and so I was kind of doing this like uh role as like a almost like a historian, I guess, like weirdly, like in that I was from day one trying to be in there watching the pre-production of something to do behind the scenes stuff. And that never ended up really materializing, but I learned a lot from sitting with the various disciplines doing that. And then kind of when I was with the marketing team, I learned a lot of, hey, like this is how many drafts something has to go through before like, and and not even like a press release, but like stuff like the back of the box and the text and menus and and the things that are just totally not anything you would ever spend time thinking about.

And when I was on a movie set, I totally watch movies differently now because I notice stuff in the background or I I think about like changes in location in a way I never did when I was just watching movies having never set foot on a set. So I I think it just gave me kind of this weird like just barely peak behind the curtain. Yeah. Um, and I should clarify that like, I wasn't in like a proper dev role at all. So it's like, I still I understand so little about like engine work or even about like checking in builds and stuff. Like I got like just kind of the like tip of the iceberg on that stuff.

How do you feel about Anthony Burch talking mad crap on Persona 5 on Twitter? Oh, yeah. I mean, he he's not the only one I've seen saying they weren't crazy about the localization. I think it's, um, there definitely are, don't get me wrong. I do think there are a couple weird choices in this localization. I do think that, you know, playing through Persona 4, I feel like I had less of that reaction. But I also feel like I'm holding this one to a higher standard in some ways. Plus having played in Japanese, I had a little bit more of a weird preconceived notion on certain things. Sure. But yeah, know, I mean, Anthony is like, I didn't make it. I make for like, I think",

I'm so happy to exist. I'm so happy Sony doesn't like when every time I see, we'll see how long they exist. Well, just every time I see like, you know, a you know, a a BigBig or Zipper or any of these like smaller studios go away, I'm like, oh, not Molecule, you know. And it's, you know, I think when every time Sony kind of consolidates their pool of worldwide studios, I understand why it's, I've never had a moment where I'm like, they shut down Naughty Dog, what?

LittleBigPlanet I worry about or I I'm, Jesus, Media Molecule I worry about because I think, um, Tearaway is awesome on Vita. I don't think it's sold really well. Uh, obviously I don't think that PS4 did any favors. Tearaway Unfolded, you yeah. And so now Dreams to me look so cool. And I talked to those guys at E3 2015 about it. And then they said more at Paris Games Week. And we've seen so many cool streams. And like, I get what they're going for, but I still don't understand that as a $60 project or product.

Like thank God for Media Molecule, man. Like keep Sony weird. In the same way it's like keep Nintendo weird. Like I want Nintendo to be doing creative things. Like for every, you know, motion control thing I'll roll my eyes at or or weird experiment that they do, I'm also so happy it's happening because it's pushing things forward.

So it's like you might be designing something and you want a tree and you'll search the catalog for tree. And maybe you made a tree six months ago and I take it and I'm like, oh, his tree is really cool, but a branch pointing upward would make it look even cooler. And I add a branch to it. And then your tree, if someone else checks it out, they can either check out the version that I made or roll it back to the one that you made. And the tree that you've placed in your world, you can then accept my changes and edit or you can keep it how it was. Like all of that, like that's one object.

But again, like, is that a $60 game? Is there a campaign? What is the campaign? Is it that they made like LittleBigPlanet? They have these like bespoke levels. And so it's like a racetrack level. So you have a racing game. But it's like, I I just don't know what that looks like yet. And I feel like I have such a tenuous grasp on what Dreams is. And that makes me concerned considering it's been shown off for four years now, more than four years now. Uh, because we first saw it before it was titled at that original PS4 Reveal.
