Thank you guys, thank you for coming in. What a **** weird world. All right, so we can curse on the show. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, we gave you nothing. Say whatever you want. Thank you for that. This is this is a huge honor. I literally came out here to San Francisco to drink coffee and watch baseball, and then I get an invite here. Talk about right place, right time. I know, right? Well, I'm glad that you got hooked up with us. Of course, you know Ming from Comic Book Men over on AMC. One of the we're going to get into your whole career here in Kevin Smith and all that jazz, but most importantly, you're here because of fellow best friend, fellow Twitch streamer, Let's Get Lexi. She was on the show last week. Then you ran into her. You met her last night. Is that what happened? Uh, I met her before. She lives in Houston. Got with some friends, but start at the game.",

You could be seeing the Golden Gate Bridge. Do this. Go hang out with Kevin and Greg for a little bit.\" Yeah, which is way better. You know, the bridge will always be there unless Magneto moves it, you know, from if Magneto moves it, if the Apes get it, there's always something going on on that bridge. Yeah, don't go on the bridge. No, every time I'm on it, I do think about that. I'm like, \"Is this going to be the time something horrible happens?\" Yeah, or uh, you know, or Christopher Walken might might fly blimp above it, you know, we might fight on top of it.

Basically, what I'm saying is stay away from the Golden Gate Bridge. Yeah, so I thought I'd geek out, hang out here. I'm glad you did. I want to geek out to you and thank you. Um, one of the things like your career, all right, career starts with 'cause it's it's you never meant to be on TV and be doing all this thing. No, no, no, no.

Um, so you're on this now because you know Kevin, because you've been friends, because way back in the day you built the View Askew website, right? Yeah, it all started uh after he made his first movie, Clerks, that black and white runchy movie that launched uh uh the two Jay and Silent Bob brought Jay and Silent Bob to the world and Dante and Randall. I saw that movie. I I loved it. Never seen a movie like that before. I like, \"Wow, this is amazing.

But I met this dude, tell me how to build websites. I like, \"I'm going to build a Clerks website.\" And not only that, \"I'm going to build the best Clerks website ever built.\" And uh, in order to do that, I needed cool content. Everyone had photos and sound clips and whatever. But I went on and bought uh for you old kids out there, a LaserDisc. Yeah, I don't know if you remember that precursor to a DVD.

Never thinking that, you know, someone might come down on me. And one day I get an email from someone that was working with Kevin that just said, uh, \"We've seen what you've done. Call us tomorrow.\" You know, Kevin wants to talk to you. And that was it. I was like, \"Uh oh.\" Yeah, I've been caught. So I was like, \"Crap. I think should I burn down my apartment? Do I, you know, do I hit run back to the motherland?\" Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. \"Do I hit the burn button? Just destroy a putting nails through my hard drive?\" And I'm like, \"You know, I'll call.

That was 20 years ago. And see, for me, I'm on the other side of the screen. I was such a Kevin Smith fan.

It's weird how things come exactly exactly. Yeah, but it's weird how, you know, that something like that uh influenced, you know, a generation and influenced people like me and you. Yeah, and got us to this point where it's like that's how I understand how I want to speak to the audience and how like this is what I was talk about with the best friend thing when I meet people and they're like, \"I don't know.

Uh, they also had this little hit show called The Walking Dead. Yeah, I've heard that one. You know, some of you kids might have heard of it. Uh, based on the initial success of The Walking Dead, they wanted a companion show based on comic book. Since The Walking Dead was based on a comic book, they didn't really know what they wanted.

I think I'm going to come, dude. That's **** awesome. Let's go. We got a show, Tim. Don't worry. We got a show after all. Tim was thinking about canceling it, but now we're not going to do. Kinda Funny Live 3 is June 3rd here in San Francisco. A whole bunch of **** happening around it. Please come check it out. KindaFunny.com/KFL3. We'll be back tomorrow. You know about the subs and all that stuff, stealing money from Amazon. You know Kevin's over there. He's cool. This is Ming. He's cool. Thank you.",
