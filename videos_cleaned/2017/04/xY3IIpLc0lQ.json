Brennan says hey Tim I've been trying to wrap my head around this trend of see these incremental console upgrades i.e. PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox Scorpio what's the point of these upgrades especially Scorpio it is four times as powerful as Xbox One but to what end developers aren't allowed to make games to take full advantage of the extra power because they need to develop the lowest common denominator base consoles it just seems like a huge waste of specs and makes the upgrade seem pointless Microsoft has stated they believe the traditional console",

I'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Josiah who also watch it your content shot to Josiah this this is an interesting thing so I have my PlayStation 4 Pro big fan of it I'm a tech guy I like my TV and that doesn't mean I'm a tech expert I am a tech enthusiast I would say I have a beautiful 4K LED TV and my PS4 creates a beautiful HDR image on it when you're playing the appropriate games Horizon, Ratchet & Clank they are",
