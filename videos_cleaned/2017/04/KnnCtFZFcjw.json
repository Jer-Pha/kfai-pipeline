That this whole thing was like in Spaceballs, like their secret handshake, the way they salute. Now tell me about this shirt. I was going to say, tell me about this shirt. I like this shirt. This is an Invincible shirt. I freaked out on uh this show when they announced the Invincible movie and they sent me this shirt. I got some water spots on it. No, it's great. I was back there making burgers this morning. It's a barbecue day. I was making the wings, have some raw juice kicked up on me, but that's just water from what I just did my hair. No, it's great.

Also good news though, look, Kevin, keep me honest, no on pit marks, right? The certain dry combination's working. Are you doing it? Um, are you doing a new like hardcore? I do. I've been on it for a while and that's why a while back impressed. Yeah, yeah, okay. But then it's, but then because the hardest thing about it is, is I use a certain dry roll on at night, M, and then it's in the morning I wake up and don't put on deodorant, right?

The analysis speculated other benefits integrating Apple consumer tech as experience in Disney theme parks and landing global streaming sports rights for ESPN via the combo of Disney-backed BAMTech and Apple distribution and a strong balance sheet.

I don't think he, he needed that breakout role that was going to, that was going to elevate him. But he was on par, he was on point for a while. He was never going to be a big deal.
