Otherwise, I just don't I don't want that negativity in my life. No, 100% that I understand that that was my concern when they announced this is like, I love Negan in the comics, but Negan in the comics is a one note thing. His entire run with the exception of where they're at right now with him. You know what I mean? Like that's a ways away for the TV show. But so that's the thing. We've already seen that with the Governor. We've already seen that with, you know, I guess the Governor is the only other example of that in this. And that was a really cool storyline.

Whereas Negan is just a psychopath who wants control and that's not compelling to me, right? You start think you start looking about like like the tribal warfare aspect is super cool. Um, but I also just feel like I don't know. I just want it to be tighter and I want it to be done. And I think maybe just for my own personal edification, I just need to be done with the show. But I think it's going to be I I mean, I think it's going to keep going for forever. Sure, sure. One of those. I think people are going to drop out.
