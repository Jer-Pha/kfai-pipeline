If you think it's real, when do you think it gets announced? When do you think it gets released? And does it also come to 3DS? That is, those are all great questions. I'm so, I think it'll be announced this year. I don't think it'll be announced at E3. Pok\u00e9mon typically aren't announced at E3. They're more of just like a random ass, it's a Tuesday. Exactly. You can throw it anytime A.M. Does not matter. That's going to blow up. Uh, so I think it'll be probably announced uh, after E3, maybe late summer, early this fall. Uh, hopefully, I mean, if it's a holiday T, that'd be great. I think, I mean, I'm guessing it would be at this point. So, um, and I would hope, I would hope it's Switch only. Like, this is this, I, if that's the case, this would be the true signal that Nintendo's treating this as their next, their next dedicated, yeah, they're all in. Yeah, absolutely agree with you there.",

Yeah, absolutely agree with you there, man. Cause it's like, if they also put this on the 3DS, it's going to sell super **** well over there. But that's that safety net that they need to remove if they want to really fully transition and have people believe that this is now the console and the handheld and this is something that they should dedicate themselves to. Absolutely. I mean, on a similar line, like it's kind of like the Smash Bros. thing with Smash Bros. 3DS and Wii U. I think that was absolutely the right decision to make. At the same time, I feel like Wii U would have done them better had it only come to Wii U. They kind of uh, you know, kneecapped the Wii U by by releasing the same game essentially on the 3DS first. Exactly. That's right. Bingo. So they need to avoid before, right? Yeah, I think six months before, three months before, I don't.",

Yeah, I think six months before, three months before, I don't even remember. It was so long ago. It felt like it wasn't, it felt like there wasn't that long between the two, but maybe maybe there was. But so that's the other thing, Smash Bros. Yep, man. So I don't see it coming this year. So I would hope, but they they, okay, they tend to announce Smash Bros. pretty far in advance. So I do think they may show it off at E3. I don't think it's coming this year though. We're already getting three big multiplayer games this year in the forms of Mario Kart, Arms, or Splatoon 2. I don't think they could unload their their last biggest multiplayer game in the same year. Do you think that it's a port though? I think it's a port. I think, I think, well, I say that loosely. I think it's going to be a port in the same vein 3DS and Wii U were. It's going to be a port of the Wii U version.",

It's going to be a port of the Wii U version with some new characters, new stages, and hopefully more, you know, all the content with the 3DS. So is it like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe type of B? So definitive edition, whatever the **** it's called. Ice Climbers and then yeah, Ice Climbers for sure. And like maybe a character or two more. Um, and then it comes out in uh, ear, I I can see the the somewhere between January and March, yeah, next year. That totally makes sense to me. Now looking at all of this, we know we're getting a whole bunch of Wii U ports, most of them already announced. We're missing a couple, Smash, Mario Maker, Treasure Tracker. Treasure Tracker, Treasure. My thing with Captain Toad is I almost feel like they would just make a new one on the Switch. I'd allow that. I'll allow that, Mr. Nintendo. Yeah, like I I just, I feel like that's the type of game.",

Is this Treasure Tracker a great game that so many people missed? Absolutely. It's true. Yeah, that's a good point. And I do think it's small enough though that they can just make make more, like make make a sequel. And like, I mean, kind of like Splatoon 2 where it's just like it it everyone thought it was a port and is it a port? No, it's a new game. But it's like really, it's not like that much of a an increase, right? And I think Captain Toad can be the same thing. But so we're dealing with all the ports. We're running out of things that I think that they would port on Wii U besides Smash, Mario Maker, and that's probably it. That's I mean, that's a big question, right?

Like they're they're already, well, just in general in terms of their own IPs, they're burning through them pretty quick. Yeah, like they're working their way through these at the pace. So if they were to do that, we get those. Let's assume that they do announce a Mario Maker for Switch and a Super Smash Bros. for Switch. Those come out, I we would imagine all before June next year. Then what do they do? Because if they've already had their Mario Kart and Smash, because if you're going to port them over, do we expect to get Mario Kart 9 and the next Super Smash Bros. in this console's life cycle? Yeah, so Mario Kart, I could see Smash Bros. I think this will be a one, I think Switch, I think Switch version will be it. Um, I I mean, I think I think it will be more than just a, I think it'll be more of a definitive version than the Mario Kart 8 is. I think.",

Mario Kart could definitely see another one, especially because they are keeping the exact branding. Like I figure for Smash, obviously for Smash with their Switch, just like Wii U and 3DS. But Mario Kart, they're very clearly sticking to this is Mario Kart 8 just with a little bit more content. Um, so yeah, I definitely expect another Mario Kart um, in this generation. How long till another Mario Golf? That man, you know, it's it hasn't been that long since the last one. And but it was DS or 3DS. But I mean, it was 3DS.

I do want a new Mario Golf though. Like I I love the 64 on GameCube one, of course. Yeah, I mean, I just need I need I need my cinematic opening, man. I need my I need the context. Why are they golf? What's happening? What's going on? Now I need a Golf bad. And I need an Animal Crossing bad. Oh yeah. I I feel like that would be a perfect December title this year.

I I think that we're getting to the point where it's like that the first year they're doing a good job with enough solid games to at least get them sold. But it's like you don't drop the big bombs until there's units out there so that people buy. And that's why I think they need to get Pok\u00e9mon Stars out exclusively on Switch ASAP, right? Like this year. So they can start working on the next gen if they haven't already started working on the next gen of Pok\u00e9mon. Uh, so that when they release that, it is to an audience big enough to sell the amount of units to Pok\u00e9mon sells. And we've seen it even on the 3DS. Anytime there Pok\u00e9mon game, core Pok\u00e9mon.",

And the other thing to keep in mind about Nintendo titles is they never drop in price. They don't ever. So if you keep the the high adoption rate that they got right now with the Switch and you keep those games, they're going to be making a lot of money off that ****. I mean, I think it's going to be a fascinating holiday season for them because even right now, let's say E3, they announced all stuff. But it's still holiday se, it's Beyond holiday season, I should say. And you know, Odyssey, what we get or whatever.

And then the the barber was like, sorry, I have I'm booked all day. I can't do it. A mid haircut, get out. It's not fever pitch by any means. Like we was where my mom wanted it after Thanksgiving. But I think by the time you get to Christmas and you like, we've all been talking so positively about this the year. And they if they can get them on shelves and, exactly. I really think they're going to sell a ton of units.

Like I it's hard to look at what 2018 even could look like and 2019. It's like when they've done so much of their franchises this year, like especially dropping a major major Zelda and a major Mario in the same year. Like holy **** that's crazy, you know? Yeah, my two favorite IPs within 10 months of each other, nine months. And that that's going to be crazy. So then the the question becomes like, all right, maybe they'll have a couple new IP. They probably will in like the range of the Arms is or the Splatoons is. And whatever. Real quick, Tim, do you believe in Arms? I I'm a believer. Yeah, I had I had fun with it in January.

And then you play like, this is awesome. This is really fun. So how how successful Splatoon 2 is going to be, you think? I think it'll be huge. Yeah, I think especially in Japan. Um, I think I think it'll be big here. I think it'll be huge in Japan. Um, and yeah, I think this the way the Switch is is going to benefit Splatoon 2 so much.

But I heard Fran never shuts up about it. Fran shuts up about, oh yeah, they love it. And so like, it's coming out. I'm like, well, yeah, there's not that much going on. There's other games, don't me wrong. But like, this is a triple-A Nintendo one. So yeah, I'll I'll play this on a plane. I'll see what the hell is all about.

But its top selling games aren't, you know, statistically near the same thing. And I I wonder that if the Switch can kind of pull that off on a bigger scale. And if their release schedule is less dry than the Wii U was, then I think that a lot of people will be like, you know what? I'm going to give Arms a shot. Buy Arms. I'm also going to buy Splatoon.

It seems like there's another great **** indie game out. Even if that tapers off and slows down, it's still going to be enough that you're turning on your Switch, you're thinking about your Switch, you're packing your Switch.

But like while you're playing it, hey, why not show you something else? I might not show you otherwise. Like all these other games you have right on the system with you. Yeah, it's like it just feels a really good way to, it just feels like a very sharable console. I mean, it's it's not as social as a Wii was, but it it kind of is in a way.

The thing is though, for me, I always like a little bit weird because a lot of people like equate those two games together. Whereas for me, like I thought those two games could be more different at the time. Really? Because Mario 64 was truly open. You go into a world, you have like 10 things you can do. Go off, do what you want. Sunshine kept the same size of the worlds, but gave it to only do one objective at a time.

I mean, part of it was like, it was a step back from 64. I thought 64 did so well. But the whole flood thing, um, I didn't like the controls for flood. I didn't like what it added to the game.

So I don't know that Mario Odyssey can have that like same type of effect on on people. But I do think that if they nail the 64 vibe, that that would be the biggest success Nintendo could ever have. I don't know that they can do that though. It's tough. I mean, I think like when I saw the trailer, the new Mario Odyssey trailer, I don't think I've been that excited for a game maybe since maybe since Mario Galaxy. I'm like, yes, that is what I want. Like that that was.",

And I was super stoked for Breath of the Wild. So I I mean, I'm with you. If they can hit this, if they nail, if they hit this out of the park, this could be huge. Um, you know, I don't know they'll do it yet. But it looks it can be a return to like what 64 was and what that that feeling was of exploring that world and finding secrets and how different environments were. That's going to be **** impressive. Let alone the fact that like if they can hit it and make it be what we think we remember 64 being, right? And that's kind of and that I mean, that kind of brings up a good point too. Or a secondary point is this is following Breath of the Wild. Now we've already had like Mario 64 when it came out was a.",

Now we've already had like Mario 64 when it came out was a breath of fresh air because it was it was open, it was huge, it was 3D. We've had that before. Now we just had the biggest version of that in Breath of the Wild. So it is going to be weird. We're having a Mario come out in the same vein as Mario 64, which I feel like was almost a predecessor to Breath of the Wild. Yeah, so I don't know. In some ways could be a step back perhaps. It's I mean, it's a different focus, of course. It's a platforming meaning. But yeah, and I mean, that's thing. Even the the the Sonic '06 looking level where they're they're in the in whatever what's it called? New Donk City, New Donk City. I it's like seeing the trailer. It is super cool seeing him kind of like be all acrobatic and around the the real looking world. Uh, but it's I'm interested in the platforming aspects of it because when you're in.",
