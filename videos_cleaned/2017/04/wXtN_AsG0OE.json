Alright, alright. Final topic, on topic: Nintendo's conference, even gonna be a conference? That is, I think that's the biggest question right now. I think in Direct Switch. So will they do the Direct with the Treehouse? I feel like there will be a Treehouse no matter what. It's a Treehouse live stream all day. Yeah, yeah, yes. Do they do the Direct? Do they do a live in-person press conference? I did not think they'd do a live in-person press conference. Really? Yeah. Ooh, what do you think? I think they do. I think they kind of, I don't know, I think they kind of have to. I think they do a Direct, and I think that is the best decision they can possibly make. Yeah, I am all about hype, and I love being in the room. Yeah, and I love seeing people cheer, and I love the awkward audience interaction. They're the only ones you can get that.",

There's definitely a charming failure. There's a showman, Tim Gettys, to be there and to have Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo next to each other. Yeah, on that level. Yeah. Having said that, we saw what they did with the Japanese conference, and that was unacceptable. We've seen what you have to offer, and when it comes to American press conferences from Nintendo, they've had better ones, and Reggie is good at that stuff. But in order for us to get a Nintendo-style press conference like Sony did last year, I think that Direct's the best bet, which is just games, games, games, games, games.

That's the thing is like, I feel like as somebody who now has a horse in the race, like love the Switch, was super ready for Kart, love with Breath of the Wild. I am now excited for a Nintendo Direct that speaks to me and is Reggie, \"What's up everybody? Welcome to a Nintendo Direct for this.\" And we've had such success of the Switch, and we're working on the supply problem, and they're not playing catch-up, or playing from a little more of a position of strength. Exactly. \"We've heard what you like about the Switch, and we're so excited with it, and let's go through all these announcements of cool games here to look more at the online, what features we're trying to sell you, come soon, I guess.

I think that should be a shoe-in. Like we already know this is coming, and it was a shoe-in, and they said December on Mario. Do we say holiday? Holiday, holiday. I believe it. I think you guys are crazy. Sunday, it's the one that I think it's going to get delayed. It's that I'm saying it could very possibly get delayed. I don't know. I'm not betting, like I'm not betting against them yet. It is just that thing of, I've seen this happen before with other developers.

Or even it's like launch, like not bundled, a standalone game. Right, right. Like Galaxy, I don't think either got the Galaxy games wrong. See, both came out as, I mean, everyone thought that Galaxy 1 was gonna come out closer to the Wii's launch. Yeah, like they didn't say, they didn't keep pushing it back. Right, dude, we talked earlier about how strange Nintendo's development is because it's so secretive. In a funny way, they don't, they don't do what a lot of other developers do from like a show as they go. I mean, that's why Zelda to me is so unbelievable is that that game had to have been in development for god knows how long, as big as that game is, and as complicated as that game is, and none of us.",

Yeah, I mean, let me saw pieces, but not. I mean, we thought I would have never predicted that that was what that game was going to. I mean, pure sure. Ever does Mario go down that similar thing where they're just not going to show much of it, and we're going to keep it real simple? It's Mario, they don't need to show a lot. But they've got this big weird gap now that I think, you know, they got a, they have to take out a fill. They really do have done the collided, technologically. Yeah, begins how long until your Switch gets dusty? Who is the question? And immediately now that I am quote-unquote done with Zelda, I'm already moving on to other stuff, and there's been a lot of fun to anything. That's great. I just beat Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment, and it is fantastic. Good. Yes, I haven't checked out. I.",

Then tonight, um, Plague Knight, the Plague Knight guy, whatever the hell his name is, Plague Knight was it? Maybe it was Plague of Torment, Specter of Torment. Whatever the first DLC pack, it was just a reskin Shovel Knight, right? With the different character, like character movement of colors. Every night is straight all new levels, and I had no ideas or like remixes or whatever, but like it's a new game. Graceful Explosion Machine next week. Yep. But okay, so we got, we got all these little games coming. That's great. But let's make passes out there. There's multi-platform, so that's not a gesture, but a little as well.

But my thing, my thing with Snake Pass is, is a perfect example of a game that could be on all systems, but people want to play it on the Switch. Absolutely. Doesn't get dusty, right? With like, they need to consist in games that people are like, completely rather play this on the Switch. So they need those. But I think they need, they need a lot more than that, right? And I think that when the Nintendo cycle comes of the people that want to believe that this is going to be the best thing ever, get the best thing ever in the form of Breath of the Wild.

With the gaming, anything Nintendo and expectations usually blows up in your face because, agenda, there was a Switch commercial when they first showed the announcement of what it was. I was like, hell yes, right? They're **** nailing it. Right? They announced the Nintendo conference on my, oh, this is, but I'll never forget being with Kevin and me, are you having this? This is a forget it. They're gonna do Sony's last E3 conference, but for Nintendo, and then they get so bad. Right? That's why with this E3, they **** it all out. And if this Mario is what Zelda was, that can be huge. Right? Will we get Metroid? Will we find out what Retro is working on? We'd better. We better. I think they have to.

Right? Because they're kind of where things kind of got off the rails was like, okay, now I played Zelda, this amazing experience. But if dust starts, that slide happens fast, and getting people back, back is gonna be a prick. I think they have to keep hitting us with little, even if I say little, I mean winners. Kart, Kart is April 28th, the way before my treat. My daughter, Dorothy, on Kinda Funny Games. Is that the day after my 27th? Okay, I'm a 29th guy, Taurus the Bull.

Nintendo can't do what Sony did, it's like, I got no more AAA games for this. Right? It's always going to be a AAA game on the horizon. And I think that the fact we're all excited about it, the fact we're playing it, the fact that literally I have Snake Pass on my PS4, and I have on the Switch, and tomorrow on the plane, I'm going to be playing it on the Switch. That's where I'm going to play Snake Pass, and then as I said before, hopefully get really good at it, come back, and platinum it. But I don't know if how actually will, but I'm going to play it there. And that's how a lot of games that Mr. Shifty, Graceful Explosion Machine, it's going to be that.

Yeah, how limiting is that going to be for them over time? Very. When it comes to third-party stuff, and also, is it, is it only going to be the Snake Pass of the world? Because like I told you guys earlier, I travel a ton for work, a ton, way more than I would ever want to. I'm looking forward to traveling now for the first time in plane rides because, go on, I like, I got a little issue with, can I, can I plug it in? If it doesn't, can you keep your Switch going without losing battery even when it's plugged in? Some of those things you needed. Um, I need enough power like, so guys don't have, oh, it's killing me.

And but if there's not enough of them out there, there's not enough of those kind of games yet. But that's being, is there are enough? Is, okay, I honestly believe that Nintendo doesn't need third parties to be successful. It needs third parties to be number one. Right, right. I think that's the key thing. But if that might was, if they're never going to do that, they gave up on that generations ago, and unfortunately, there's not in that race. But that Wii U failed despite being a Nintendo machine. But not, I love my Wii U. The way you failed for so many different reasons.

Told you, could you about, will be a game-changer. Right? Because graphically, I mean, Overwatch is incredibly complicated, but it's not a technical powerhouse. If you can do it, it's that thing of what do you want on your Switch? And I would love to play Andromeda on the go and do all these everything and like planet. But like for me right now, it's playing Persona 5 and be like, ****, and I want to pack it for this trip because I want to play in the hotel room. And it's like, that would be awesome on the go.

I'm googling quickly on the show. But if the Atlus is talking about it recently about bringing games to the Switch, right? It's going to be where is the audience and what do people want from it? Well, those games, that's to me the shoe-in. Like the third party, we're not talking about by H.I.V.E. G.S. or like those.

Yeah, the other was gone for Atlus announces new Etrian Mystery Dungeon, Shin Megami Tensei, and 3DS. ****, where's this? I swear to God, I thought it really said, thank you. To go say Shin Megami Tensei. So the thing is like, the Switch does have the, at the Japanese conference, they did announce a whole bunch of different games. There were like, 'l will see them one day. Fire Emblem 2018, they talking about, we know this stuff. They said Xenoblade Chronicles 2 coming in this year. I'm like, that's going to get pushed.

Get granted, there's good and bad with having a game that seven and eight-year-olds play. But that game, there's a huge community to play in that game. Sure. And I think that the Switch is going to give it such a new appeal. It's going to give it a second chance. You think Kart will too? What do you think Kart's gonna do? Kart's such a different, rare instance where everybody loves Kart, and I don't love it or not. Just having Kart on a system is going to be, if done, a system seller.

But it's like, I hated the Wii so much, I didn't play it, and I just don't. So little that people didn't play it. And like, you go back in Mario Kart Wii was a juggernaut. People own that game, and attached, right? Was insane. Yeah, I really think you are going to see that again here because it's going to be, I have a Switch, I loved Kart in the past. I love Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Why not have those experiences again of being at PAX, and yes, you're waiting in line, you're all playing Kart together.

I mean, in a perfect Smash guy, I'm not a Smash. I have some games. You can't read the game. I wish I haven't. Don't like the big button mashing with Smash. It's inevitably going to happen. I think Mario Maker is lying. I've been fine, Joe. Well, Mario Maker be at E3? That's a bit more of a question mark to me. But those are, I think, shoe-ins. They're going to happen.",

But those are, I think, shoe-ins. They're going to happen sooner than later. Before next February, they'll all be out on the Switch. Yep. But that leaves the Switch in a weird place where it already has a Mario Kart, already has a Smash. Where do they go from there? So it's like, do they keep doing DLC for this Mario Kart, making yourself, or does Mario Kart 9 eventually come out? And if so, when? Yeah, I think they go DLC. I think they go as good as the DLC was, and it was. I mean, it was fantastic. Like that was the way to do DLC. Like I would have bought up many, go whatever, more of it for them. Never make another Kart. Like daughter plays, that's one game she'll sit down and play separately in the room. Right? Like they did that one right. I think they kind of have to to delineate and separate it from the Wii U game. They have to do that. I think they do. I think they have to.",
