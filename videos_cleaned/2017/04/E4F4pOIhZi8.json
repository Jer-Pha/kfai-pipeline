Abrams style was very much and not not for good for better for worse his style was very immune in everything that we saw in those original teasers and trailers you know you saw his this particular level of action you were commenting yesterday movie well that back when we watched the trailer for episode 7 how you were like that's a little bit different than Lightspeed we've seen before because it's very much starts out yeah I think",
