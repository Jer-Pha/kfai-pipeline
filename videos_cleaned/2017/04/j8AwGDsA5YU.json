This is The GameOverGreggy Show Patreon exclusive for February 2016, 2017. It takes a while, you know, there's that Patreon bonus episode, your Patreon bonus episode. There's been a lot of changes this year. We got, we're still working out the kinks, trying to figure this all out. Tone, thank you very much for joining us. You are, are very influential to what Kinda Funny is and will be, I think. So to be able to sit down and talk with you like this is, it's going to be fun. We'll get at an hour of an adventure here. All right, I'm looking forward to it, man. Thanks for having me here, you know what I'm saying? I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a fan of these guys now. Yeah, that's, that's the cool thing. I love it.

And everybody at home knows that by now because I talk about it so much on every show that we do and everything, every single video and whatever it is, there's always something. Um, but for this, I, what I want to do is make sure that we're hitting all the, the, the spots here because I, I know that a lot of people that are listening to this are not familiar really with you, with your music and with who you are. So I want to make sure we're not getting too lost in the weeds of the like minutia and weird like, you know, nerd shit that like, you know, these people just don't understand.

So it's going to be kind of a mixed bag. So just, just putting that out there for the viewers so you understand what, what, what you're getting into. I'm excited. I mean, to start off like, who are you? My name is Tony Roas, uh, but I'm more commonly known as Tonedeff on the interwebs. Um, I've been, uh, recording and producing music for, uh, quite a while. I put out my first, um, solo EP in 1997. Started an independent record label called QN5 Music and, uh, I've, we've released as QN5, we released over 40, there's over 40 releases. And, um, unfortunately, out of those 40 releases, I've only released two albums at this point. Um, long story, uh, how that happened, but, um, I put out my first album in 2005 called",

Um, long story, uh, how that happened, but, um, I put out my first album in 2005 called Archetype. You can check it out, it's on iTunes. Um, and I just recently, after 11 years of a hiatus, I put out my second album called Polymer. So, um, if you are a fan of singer-songwriters, I'm the rapper for you. If you are a fan of, uh, really technical rapping, I'm the rapper for you. If you're a fan of genre mashing and, um, alternative music like synth-wave or Shoegaze music, um, I'm the rapper for you. I try to mix all these elements and make something new that nobody's ever heard before, um, but still kind of keep it, you know, to me and personal, you know. So that's a, that's in a nutshell, that's what I do. And it's fuckin' fantastic. So the, the visuals that we're seeing behind us are, is the artwork for the four EPs that make up the, the new album Polymer. Uh, this was the second one, Demon. Earlier we were seeing",

There's so everything you do, there's always so many layers, there's always so much thought put into everything, including the artwork. Like here, so, so for Demon, the, the kind of idea of the album is that, is you kind of battling with, with time and with your anxiety and all that. And you can see it here with like, um, the tire tracks and stuff make the clock and stuff. Like, I'll let you elaborate more from there. But yeah, uh, this, um, these covers, the first three covers were done by, uh, an amazing Eisner Award-winning cartoonist named Becky Cloonan. She's an illustrator.

Um, so, you know, I'm glad, glad she's making moves. Um, so this would be the hunter cover. This is the third one she did. Um, she did a, uh, cover for, um, a group that I work with called CunninLynguists and, um, album called The Piece of Strange. And I fell in love with it. And I heard, I started researching work a million times. The Piece of Strange is incredible. Go check that out. Um, so I fell in love with her artwork and I reached out to her to see if we could work together on something. Um, this album is, the new album is a four-piece, uh, you know, collection of EPs. Uh, each EP had its own style, its own theme, um, and its own sort of, um, you know, vibe to it. Um, and each, each one had needed a completely different cover to kind of justify their existence.

So, um, this would be the cover for Phantom, where it's, you know, this a person who's not really in control of their life and there's this kind of like horrible, you know, black cloud floating over it, controlling all the pieces of them and manipulating them, you know. So where's your self-control start? That sort of thing, you know. So the Jenga man, all these little somebody who can easily fall apart, you know what I'm saying? And, uh, like, who's really in control of these pieces? So that's kind of the level where I try to, you know, take all of my, um, my artwork.

Um, this is, uh, the from the, the cover for the first EP, Glutton, from Polymer. Um, basically this album dealt with, uh, you know, my sort of the black hole that I was living in for a little while and when I rock bottomed essentially with, you know, my sexual addiction issues and all that. So which you can hear about on The GameOverGreggy Show that was on. Yes, uh, so and so that it's symbolized with, yeah. So if you, if, if you could see it now, we can do the de white. So right over here we have breasts and right over here we have, uh, this gaping wound. So in a nutshell, um, I wanted to kind of signify, if you notice like the, her breast kind of form eyes and her womb kind of forms a mouth and the guts form a tongue.

So the, the more consumed you become, the more you are consumed by what you're consuming. And so you can't really see it right now 'cause it's just part. So that's you eating this with a, you see the eyes in the back. It's sort of like that, that deep dark sexual id. So I mean, all of this is, it's so, so ridiculous, but that's kind of why I fell in love with your, your art from the beginning. And it's, I don't even want to say I fell in love with your music because it's so much more than that. Like, I feel like you pay attention to every single aspect of the experience, right?

And of course that's hard, but like that many people have done, right? But I think you, it goes way deeper back to the experience thing where QN5, the label, it wasn't just a bunch of rappers together or even a bunch of artists together. Like QN5 was a family. Yes, yeah. Uh, QN5, I mean, essentially was this, the idea that I had was to make it a, um, you know, a community-driven record label. Um, and, and kind of, you know, we were pretty much the first guys on the record label front to really use the internet in that way. Um, we just so happened to be a very tiny hip-hop label out of New York City, you know what I mean? And, um, you know, when, when we were starting to do our releases",

And, um, you know, when, when we were starting to do our releases and using message boards and things like that, uh, to release our records and, and do the shows that we, the way we were doing them, nobody was doing it in that space. So a lot of people gave a shit for that. Like, we were routinely called 'Nets and internet rappers and dismissed and not really kind of given any sort of credit. So it's hilarious now to see that every artist ever, their entire career is based off their online presence. And that's, that's the, the, the ironic thing about the whole, whole thing is that you, you guys, you're, you're the slogan for QN5, one of the many was, uh, five steps ahead of the game. Yeah. And I feel like that was accurate from the moment it began until right now where it's just like, it's just always, always is too over the head of everybody until they understand it and then",

Yeah. You know, there was, there was always a degree of that. Like, how far can, how far can we take the conceptual stuff? But at the same time, like, how can we kind of keep it open-ended for like Layman, you know, to kind of come into it? Um, I think, I feel like we, we managed to walk that line pretty well. I feel like as when we started, it was definitely more sort of mainstream leaning or like what was popping in music leaning. And as which was Battle Rap and kind of dick jokes and Yo mama stuff. Yeah, just, you know, just, you know, just Cipher style shit, you know, punchlines and, and, and just being crazy and saying shocking shit, you know what I mean? Um, just for m& Factor. Yeah, I mean, yeah, like around that time period, that would probably be like the closest approximation of the early QN5",

Yeah, I mean, yeah, like around that time period, that would probably be like the closest approximation of the early QN5 stuff, right? And then as years went on and, and we all started to grow within our music, we, the, the work became more complicated and became more conceptual. So like the fans that stuck with us were like experiencing these completely different sides of the, of us, you know. Like as we grew, the music grew. And then the, you know, the, the, the metaphors grew and the, the, the levels of complexity and the records grew. The production became more complex, became more lush. So to the point where I'm doing a record like Polymer, I wouldn't even fuckin' even knew where to start to make Polymer 10 years ago or 11 years ago 'cause I, I wasn't artistically there yet. You know, CunninLynguists was part, you know, part of QN5 when they made Will Rap for Food. You know, you compare that to Oneirology, their last studio album, it's a fuckin'",

But the, the artistic achievements that you're getting now from the artist, it's, it's beautiful to see because people invested their time and can, you know what I mean? Like you follow along. But to see an artist mature and to for people to allow the artist to mature, that was the QN5 thing. Like everybody was like picking it apart and it forced us to make it deeper so that there was more to pick apart. And that's the thing, it felt like at every step of the way, uh, while you guys were five steps ahead, there was people like trying, trying to tell you, it's like, you're going the wrong way, you're walking the wrong direction.

Wow. And, uh, my brother was like so far from that as well. Like, he was probably like 14 at the time. And but, but we still went to the show. We still stood outside of this small ass little bar on Haight Street for hours just trying to hear from the outside to the point of the, the security guards being like, and it's just like that type of shit where it's like, we were so dedicated and it almost didn't matter because like, we ended up seeing just at least hearing stuff and seeing people.

It's not like they're the most simple things ever. They're **** super constructed and lush and, you know, deep and and it's like both of us together.

No, it's 2009, pretty sure. Did we show the video in 2013? Goddamn, man. Wait, hold on. It it must have been 2013 because it was like the Future Part, right? Oh, you're right. Yeah, yeah.

And that **** was **** awesome. Then it ended with the future. And there was a couple new songs, um, some of which I'm pretty sure never even came out. Yeah, yeah, a couple of them.
