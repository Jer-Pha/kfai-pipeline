This show, by the way, nobody knows when it is than you to Salem Al-Falah being producer. You are the man, the myth, the legend. I want to talk about E3 predictions and I want to put this out there now. This is, this is our right now, March 9th. Yeah, I want to have a first round. Let's start talking about E3, what we think is going to happen from a big perspective. Later, obviously, we'll do more in-depth, we'll dive, what's, we'll take bets, we'll make, you know, try to see what we think is going to happen. We should throw some things out there that we can loop back to as it were. That's where I'm at, that's where I'm at, and say, did we get it? Did we not get it?

And so now, like, all right, cool, you're here, so talk. So E3, what I want to talk about is the press conferences, specifically The Big Three: Nintendo, Xbox, Ubisoft, PlayStation. Oh, PlayStation, right, sorry, my apologies. Ubisoft, I'm sure we'll bring those guys up as well. But I want to talk about what we think they're going to do at their conferences from a just overall, because last year and this year, very different landscapes they were dealing with, right? Last year, Nintendo comes out, they had their one game, which was Zelda, amazing booth for Zelda, but nothing else. Yeah, and people loved it.

Their last E3 conference was 2011, if not 2013, maybe. No, it was 2013, because 2014 was the first time they did Direct. We still at, yeah. So, uh, Sony comes out, games, games, games. They have to home run, home run, home run. Grand Slam. Sports references. You have not, you don't know how home runs, home run. If you do four home runs in a row, that's a grand slam, right? Yeah, so there's that. And then Xbox, surprising everybody, coming out and being like, very solid, very solid conference. I'm out of order on this, but very, very solid conference, announced Scorpio, blowing people's minds. Nobody expected that. Everyone expected PS4 Pro, that didn't happen.

And that was the interesting thing, right, about both, uh, PlayStation and Nintendo, right, where they had to get out in front of those stories where Nintendo's like, Switch will not be there. And PlayStation's like, we're not doing the Pro stuff. Like, that's not what this is about. For remind me, we knew about, we knew the Switch, we knew something was coming from Nintendo, but we knew NX, we knew was, we knew that NX would not be at E3, and we knew that Nintendo was only going to have one game at E3. Gotcha. And so they, they had Zelda in addition to that during their, so they did their, they released the Zelda trailer. I'm going to grab a computer.

It was the, it was yourself up, the first Zelda: Breath of the Wild trailer where they revealed the name of the game. Oh, that wasn't the first trailer they revealed the name of the, the first trailer was at E3 2014. Did they really show in that far back? Yeah, it was 2014. Yeah, it must have been when we thought it was going to be Wii U forever. So yeah, it was a Wii U game. The Link came out and like jumped and shot the Guardian with arrow. Yep. So, but we knew it was Breath of the Wild then. And then they went on to do the Nintendo Treehouse all day. The big daddy, the, the Treehouse all day where they, they demoed Zelda and showed all the, was that Treehouse awesome, by the way? Like to see it from a, from a distance, looked oh, phenomenal.

Uh, but they did announce a bunch of random 3DS games as well. But that was like just during The Treehouse and it was like smaller titles here and there and like some Wii U stuff too. But nobody gave a crap at all. Um, literally, right? Yeah. So then, then yeah, there was PlayStation just straight killing it. But yeah, Microsoft was the one that was a bit more like, they had a lot of the big AAA third-party games. They had that Final Fantasy XV showing that was embarrassing. Um, and then they, they showed Scalebound. They showed Scalebound got canceled. Whole bunch of other stuff. Sea of Thieves.

We haven't seen Crackdown in a long time. That's the thing. I think I don't think Crackdown was there last year, wasn't? I think they skipped. I mean, they, they announced, I, I remember they announced it one year and then they skipped and everybody was like, where the hell is it? So that must have been. Anyways, getting, getting to it now, predictions. What do we think is going to happen this year? Where do you want to start, Greg? Wherever you want to, big guy. Let's start with Microsoft. Okay, let's do that. I think they open and they have, they come right out with Scorpio, uh, top of the show. Do they teraflop us to death?

And it was like, well, sure, like, you know, Colin did, Colin was right about it where it was like, yeah, well, Greg's excited for State of Decay 2. I don't, it's not, that's not a Halo. That's not, that's not a system seller. That's not anything like what we've seen with Sony's first-party stuff here in the last little bit. Yeah, not even close. And so that's the thing of like, I think you come out and while that press conference has to address the fact of, hey, there are still games this year, I think you lead with the biggest story you have of like, hey, here's Scorpio and",

You got to think that, not to interrupt you, but you got to think that they, they had to have learned from the initial Xbox One launch event. Yeah, that was, that really, you know, didn't, didn't go the way they wanted. And given the home run that Sony hit last year with games, games, games, games, games. I mean, that whole press conference was wall-to-wall. Sure, you had, I mean, that, yes, you want to talk about the new hardware, but I got to think Microsoft's figured out that this is the time to talk about games too.

Yes, play on Xbox One and play are better on Scorpio. I think that it needs to be the kind of the actual good parts of the Nintendo Switch January conference. They did like the few good things, the non-campy, straight, right? Like that conference was so bad. But again, I always say that the announcements made in it were not bad, specifically starting that conference off, hey, Switch is coming March 3rd, sooner than anyone thought it was coming.

I wouldn't be surprised if they totally dodged the price, save the price for the end of it, or save the price for, save for an event. Because I think that the big rumor and the thing about this is going to be super expensive, because it is going to be the, it's going to have awesome guts in it. I, I can tell you from just the industry that I'm in, component parts are really going up a lot. I mean, they're, they're going to be challenged to put this box out at a reasonable price. I mean, it's going to be an expensive product. I mean, what, what they're trying to put in this thing, this is a genuine, it's a PC. It is a very, I say high-end, it's a mid to upper range PC. It is.

My, I don't even know where I sit anymore on those predictions. What is Scorpio now? Now, now that the PS4 Pro is out and now that we're getting these rumors and we know they're going to hit hard at, at E3. I, I honestly don't really know. I feel kind of 50/50 about the, you know, the rumors about Scorpio that were leaked. I would say what, in the last three to four months, but then were from documentation at the reveal of Scorpio at E3. We're saying basically it is PlayStation 4 Pro before we knew what PlayStation 4 Pro was. It was doing the checkerboarding thing. It was doing. So like, it's this weird, how do you handle it? And how do you learn from what Sony has and not even screw up, right? Because you guys have Pros and you're super excited when my",

I'm just not motivated to run out and buy it. What have they learned from that? And I think that that's why it has to, you have to make the case of, here's what the Scorpio is, here's how this is the teraflops. Let's look at 13 games that are coming to the Xbox One and the Scorpio, but are better on Scorpio. Hope they demo. I mean, that's the issue with a lot of that technology is it doesn't demo well. It doesn't. I mean, it's the same challenge VR had. It's the same challenge that HDR has. It's the same all of it. Unless you have the right setup to see it, it's, it, it rings really hollow.

They need to sell consoles. They need to kind of get back, yeah. I mean, they got to get people excited about the Xbox brand again. And that's where, that's where there's this disconnect on how this is going to be handled. If I'm there and I'm doing it, I'm getting you excited about Scorpio. So I'm opening with Scorpio and I'm saying Scorpio is this next revolution. It does all these different things. Look at all these different games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. If they're coming at it and they're thinking it is an incremental step, it is like PlayStation 4 Pro, then yeah, you put that later, mid in the conference somewhere. I don't know, man.

Yeah, I think it's somewhere in between the two where I forever thought that it was going to be the next Xbox system. Like, like they're saying, whatever the crap they want, this is the Xbox 2 or whatever, or just go back to calling it Xbox, whatever it is, right? But I, the, the closer we get to this and where I'm at right now, I do think that this is just a better PS4 Pro. Like, I think that they'll be able to come out and say, we have the most powerful system. But if they don't hit that head on, that's a problem, because PS4 Pro has been out for how long now?

So that could be the, they do that with games though. They have to do it with games still. But what, what I imagine happening is they come out, they announce this thing and there's, they announce at the beginning, you think? I, I do think that like, yeah, I mean, that does make sense. But they come out, but I, I wouldn't be surprised if they come out with a price, $400. Really? Yeah. And I'm putting this out there just being like, I feel like they have to. That is bet number one on the table. Fellas, we'll make bets when we're closer. But, but I bet you an Xbox, you a Scorpio.

And that's the thing, I think that, I think this might be like a PS3 situation where you, they have to sell it at a loss. They have to try to make up ground, you know what I mean? Fine. Well, like I'm saying, you know, PlayStation cut their price before they were able to do that. Here, just cut it out the gate and be like, yep, we're doing this. We have to, we have to make it up and we have to make excitement and we have to go do this thing. And the fact that the Switch was $300, I don't think $400 is that crazy. And I think obviously people on the inside are going to be like, oh, that $400's so cheap. It should, it's, we think it's going to be $600, $700.

What are those games? Because I do think that we're going to see Halo at E3. I, they have, it's not going to come out this year and it's, I think it's going to be a late 2018 game. But Halo will be at E3. So what do I mean? First of all, what do we know that is first-party end of the year? What are, what are the big cornerstone, hang their hat on? That's the problem, right? Is that we don't, because it is. Crackdown is, they've said Crackdown is coming this year. They said State of Decay coming this year. Uh, Halo Wars is February.

If there is a, they're not going to do, yeah, right, yeah. Um, so I don't, I don't know what, I mean, they have to show Halo there in that vein. If I had, if I, Forza. I mean, they're, they're going to have some, there's going to be Forza. There's going to be cars everywhere. Sure, Forza Horizon. But, but with Halo, I, if I had to bet, I would bet that they announced Halo 6, whatever that is. Um, and, and have some kind of playable demo. I imagine they were that they, if I'm doing my math right, yeah, I am. Halo 3's 10th anniversary is this year. They will do a, a Halo 3 update in the same way that they've done, um, The Other Guys, Master Chief Collection. So Halo 3, I mean, Halo 3 was part of the Chief Collection, but I think that they",

Some of them were, I mean, last, I mean, they, Xbox is a third-party when it comes to, uh, their conferences. They've always done that. So Assassin's Creed, maybe they pull that in. They pull the new Assassin's Creed Empire. Far Cry 5. Is there a, those type of games? I mean, obviously Ubisoft has its own conference, but they pulled those in in the past and done fine with them.

And I, I just, I don't think, I think that a new Halo on Scorpio pushed the right way and talked about the right way with a Halo coming this year to satiate people's needs. I think that is big enough, because that is what Xbox has. Like, they have Gears. They have all, I mean, I'm sure we'll see some Gears DLC. Gears was good, by the way. Don't you played Gears? Gears was good. I'm not Gears guy, but yeah, it was good. It was good. But I mean, the thing is, they already had that. So it's like, what, what other big franchises does Xbox have? Halo 5, 2015 November. So it's years. So that's what I'm saying, Halo's",

Looking at this, this list right here, something, something interesting that I hadn't thought about is Perfect Dark. Yeah, now Perfect Dark is, it's been way too long since we've seen one, so it's not the Juggernaut that it used to be, sure, but it still has that name. It still has a name and that has that comeback like, oh, ****, this is happening, feel that is bigger than the Killer Instinct that they have and they've been treating really well and kind of growing over the last couple years.

It just seems to me like especially in the last, I don't know, maybe four years, there have been so many good press conferences and so many bad ones. They all learn from each other, right? And I feel like this is the year where all of the things that people have learned are, you know, there's not going to be any mistakes anymore as far as totally missing the market. But it's not even that thing of mistakes, it's the fact of like on Crackdown, State of Decay, awesome, a Halo thing, great. But is that enough? Is that enough?

Yeah, but yeah, yeah, matter those things, you know, they do add up here and there, but it's a here and there, it's not a change the game now Game Changer thing. The, the thing with Halo is it's been around for so long and it's had, you know, the five core titles, ODST and Reach in addition to that. So that's, that's six full games, right? No, sorry, seven full, like full real proper Halo games, five regular and then the two. And then of course there's the Halo Wars, total, totally different type of spin-off.

I mean, they, they were going that way is awesome and people love the characters and they've started this arc with Halo 4 and 5 where they're, they're moving past one, two, and three built off and there now is the all these different characters and classes and all this ****. And I think that the, the world is ready, especially now that Bungie's moved on to Destiny, like 343 knows what they're doing with Halo and it is getting a bit samey.

The other thing that queued in my mind while we're talking about this, um, when we talk about something they could have, stick with me because again, I don't think this is that big of a deal based on how Xbox, it's performed on Xbox before.

That's a great point. Yeah, it's Square that's doing the event, right? Right. Yeah, yeah. And it's what, uh, uh, the rumor is Eidos Montreal.

David Jaffe riding out on a Sweet Tooth after you, you lie to our face. Jaffe speak. Did you see that? That's going to be, you probably did and I'm behind that.

I think if Microsoft wants to make waves, they have a, they have a trailer there. They do something Rockstar that way.
