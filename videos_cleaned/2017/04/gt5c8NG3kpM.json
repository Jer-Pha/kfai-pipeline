Yeah, I just were, \"Stu, you're like, this is still funny, like stop, just give us a real smile.\" I was like, \"Okay, hold on.\" What's up everybody? Welcome to the Kinda Funny Morning Show for April 6th, 2017. Holy ****, Nick Scarpino, what up? It's April, April. We're getting close to Kinda Funny Live. Did we miss April Fools? No, it happened, it came and went. Some people were fooled, some people weren't. Mine didn't get fooled. Yeah, but it was Saturday. Well, it was Saturday, so I wasn't looking at any news. Oh, so it's unfortunate. That's always the unfortunate thing when we were at IGN making those projects is we were like, \"Is it on a Saturday?\" Thwarted by even April, April Fools had thwarted us before it even began. IGN's April Fool's video was fun. Yeah, they did a Grand Theft Auto in real life. Did a good job. The TV show, did you watch the, the video? Did Alex Salameh laying on the beach as Trevor with that",

It's a new, it's a new paint that basically like does like allows for like 0.1% of light refraction or something. It was crazy.

I saw this story too. Isn't that wild? Can you bring it up, Kev? No, like this is the kind of **** that Skynet appropriates and then kills the world with, you know what I mean? Wow. And I like the video when they start, they put it on other surfaces that are quote unquote black and then it like, look, see, gobbles up on the light like a black hole.

Kevin, if there's, there's a link to the YouTube video in there. There it is. There it is. It is. Bring that up. And so that's, that's not it. That's that's a piece of of traditionally painted black metal and you can see it here. So this is their, this is their earlier iterations of it from left to right, the right being the newest one.

Its RAM and hard drive read speeds are also improved, meaning 4K resolutions should be easily achieved and maintained. You like that?

I don't know how much it's going to pay off. Like this is going to be in a very interesting E3. Well, you have to assume how long is this console going to last now? This is a new, this is for all intents and purposes, it's a new console, right? So here's the thing with Xbox's new mantra of this Play Anywhere. Uh, they, they're trying to create, uh, a world where there's no more console generations and it's going to last forever. Interesting. Like that, that the Scorpio is just going to play Xbox One games and they'll still work on the other systems. They'll just be better on this one. And I mean, PS4 Pro is that as well. But PS4 Pro is so much more",

I don't know that the world necessarily needs this and it's going to be an uphill battle for Microsoft to convince people that they do. Because the people that are buying Xbox for its exclusives, there are, they already have one. They're sold, whatever. Sure. Everyone else right now is, is on the, the PS4 boat just because PS4, the shift in the generations has been on, on their side. Like last year was very much 360, PS3 lost, right? This year is very much PS4, Xbox One's losing. Similar to our political climate, goes eight years Dem, eight years Republican.

It's interesting because this is going to be important for like third party games. Like because now Xbox, the top tier Xbox will have the definitive version. Yeah, of, you would think if they program for it, right? But I mean, that's, that's my question. I don't too much about this. Do they program for the, the most powerful version of it or they program for the least powerful version of it? You know, do they program for PS4 Pro or for the higher version? Well, it sounds like that this **** is able to just unlock this and then just do the boost mode thing.
