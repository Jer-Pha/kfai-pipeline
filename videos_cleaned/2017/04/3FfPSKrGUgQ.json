The Wii U just never like here we don't know what to do with it. It is kind of interesting that Ubisoft probably had a better grasp on how to use it Nintendo did um no dude I'm with you man like I I mean I feel like I want to say they should reboot Star Fox that's literally what they've done like three times now like I don't know what they do with Star Fox now I mean I think they they **** up too bad with zero like I think it's done and that hurts me it really hurts me but you know what maybe one day um there's there's a good one here okay we didn't even talk about Virtual",

Tyler Quill says what launch games do you want to see for the Virtual Console? I mean on the one hand like you want the classics you want Mario you want Zelda you Mario World exactly uh but on the other hand I I own like everyone owns like three four times over probably I want stuff they haven't re-released yet like I would love to get the super FX games finally get Yoshi's Island on there we were talking before how that's your like your favorite game right? Love it man yeah that Now's the Time bring it it is it definitely is I I'm interested in Virtual Console in every way of just when's it happening how's it happening what's the deal but what we've seen before with the Wii and Wii U 3DS DS all that stuff is that they trickle it out",

I mean it it worked for the Wii I don't know what you can say how it did for the Wii U but I mean the Wii U obviously didn't do well so I don't think they could trickle out again to the same degree there are still games that were on Wii virtual console that aren't on the Wii U's Virtual Console they do that again yeah then you'd have to do the dumbass",
