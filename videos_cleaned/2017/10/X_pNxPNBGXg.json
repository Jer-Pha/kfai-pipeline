We're supposed to, you know, we're like social media influencers. We need to say that apparently, otherwise the FTC rolls up in a big bus and they go, \"Hey, you, you're bad!\" Enjoy Party Mode. What's up, everybody? Welcome to Friday the 13th Party Mode. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller. Of course, Party Mode is our crazy ass let's play series where we just have fun together and do stupid things. You can get it early on Patreon.com/KindaFunny, one week early each and every Wednesday. But if you want the free version, a week later it pops on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. For now, let's meet all the counselors I'll be killing. Kinda Funny, sound off! Okay, it's Joey, it's me, Andrea, it's me, Andy, it's Kevin. Cool Greg's like, \"What's happening?\" Hey, what's up everybody? It's me, Nick, just stupid shit. Let's play. Cool Greg sounding off.

I got yogurt tonight at 5:30. Tim, squad up with me. Cool Greg, squad up with me. So here we go, everybody. I'm Jason Voorhees. I play a lot of Friday the 13th. I'm expecting to kill these people because they never play and they're terrible games, as you all know by watching Nick Scarpino. They're all counselors. I'm Jason. Let's see what happens. So if anyone's wondering, I am Chad, the douchey guy with the scarf. I am a guy. Oh no, I don't know what I am. Jason, don't you dare. I'm in Platte. I'm gonna sit in this car. Well, I see somebody. I have a really good feeling that I'm gonna die quickest. Joey, Tim, Tim, come on, let's go to the big house. I'm with Joey and Andrea. Okay, I'm going into a cabin. Lock the door. Did you walk",

Is he here already? Oh damn it, Tim, I'm so screwed. Tim, you screwed me. How do I lay a trap? Joke on it, you son of a bitch. Look at him. I just think about every games Cassie ever shit talk to over me. He always, Joey, you got it, got it. He all here. Move your crying. Stop crying, Joey. Move this stupid ass trap. All right, whatever, traps is gonna stay there. Yeah, but he doesn't know where I'm at. There's nothing in this drawer. There's nothing in this drawer either. My cabin sucks, guys. Can we trade? There's one again right now. We got some gas there. What do you got there? Battery looks like. Oh no, oh no, Greg is right behind me. Get away, Greg. How do I drop this shit? I don't want to hold",

I, he's right behind me in the shit 8-bit music playing and my guy's tired. Well, he's gonna get you, Andy. He's gonna get you. No, come on, shit already. I knew it was gonna be me. Everyone must die. Everyone, shit. Oh, oh, Tim died first. Yeah, oh, you shit loser. They were trying to get this car up and running, so let's booby-trap the car. Let's trap a little, a little footsie grabber over here, as they call him. I like that. I'm watching my brother play right now and that's just funny. Cool Greg, the more you move, the more he hears you. Is that? Yes, you might want to hide. Oh, who's Jason? You know what? I'm rooting for Jason. You all shit sold me out. No, I don't know, maybe not. We'll see. Joey, hello. He's hot in the corner.",

You could get me the goldfish off of Andy's desk, that'd be great. I'm almost dead already from jumping out of that thing, so we got to find you some first aid. Joey, you don't need first aid, you need my healing touch. Come here, Joey. Joey, you are done. Tommy looks like the guy from Princess Bride, kind of. Was that real? Oh, I, I'm Tommy Jarvis. I like to hack a little bit, get them to flush him out. Should be enough. How long does this shit last for? She's still here. Oh yeah, she's hiding in there. Okay, that's here. This is probably a mistake. I'm probably gonna die. It's my destiny to do this. Can we play Destiny? Oh, it feels good, all their blood. I saw her. Found you yet, Cool Greg?",

All right, what you guys to know, I've never played this game and I am once again the longest reigning champion of something. What else? You survived Nixon like this female circumcision. I was born to play this game, guys. I was born to play this game. Cool Greg, no, sorry guys, not even touching my controller right now. Tell me that's how good I am at this game. Look at this, hands-free. Don't like it, Nick, playing video games hands. Your trinkets start, but you don't even dream Starbucks. You just roll a nice rack. It was a Starbucks and then it's a kombucha. Kombucha. Oh God, it's a cranky boot your kombucha. It's 'cause they kombucha, but like not too hard on the kombucha. Can we call kombucha the boot?

Nick already called it the boot. Oh shit, what happened? It's just, it just glitched. No, Nick is still hiding under the bed. Why is the music getting really intense? I don't know. I don't understand. I think he's near you or he's doing something shit up to someone else. You just got, you got 13 minutes left, Nick. 13 minutes. Oh, that's not gonna last 13 minutes. No, I think I'm still alive. It's just a really weird 80s music though. Someone's texting me. Are you just looking at a corner? I'm just underneath the bed. Why are you underneath the bed? Why not? It's worked so far. Shit, damn dog. You already had lunch. I know you're on a diet, but would you like some shotgun in your face, Greg Miller? Andy, try that again please. Would you like a lot of those shotgun bullets in your, in your mouth? It's getting worse. It's just so we don't have holy shit, Sasha",

Can I throw my car keys at him? My brave Nick Scarpino, where are you cowards? Are you used to playing, Nick? Yeah, mom texting. Also, he should have been using that time while Jason was chasing Tommy to figure out an escape route. Hey, listen, I'm only, I'm only, you know, backseat driving because I'm dead and I have nothing better to do. How much time is left? Ten, ten minutes, man. Shit, an eternity. Lot of houses to search. You know, I'm gonna go here. Oh shit, Greg, you're gonna sniff him out. Try it, Andy. I went backwards. Don't tell anybody. So that's the right way. I want to go. That's why they sold you out, Nick.
