I may be bone real skinny, but I ain't no, that's fine. What's the verdict? Greg Miller, and these are the final photos from my phone before I realize how **** I was. It starts back in May of '01. Uh, I was getting ready for something called Judges Week Pre-E3. You might have heard of it before. Basically, what happens is every heads down to LA for a week set up by Geoff Keighley. You go down there, you see these games, you get to see everything's gonna happen at E3 before E3, so you have things and you can vote in blah blah. It's video game stuff you'd reported. I'm sure you don't care about video games since no way you're here. Uh, I was packing for Pre-E3, pillow on the bed, suitcase in front of me, putting T-shirts out, putting them in, and I went like this and felt my lymph nodes were swollen up, and my first thought was **** I'm",

And this has happened before. A couple years before, I've gone down with Damon and Nate. I was rooming with Damon, and I'd gotten deathly ill, had to get the NyQuil, I had to sit on the bed, be all sad, not go out drinking with everybody. It sucked. And so I'm super upset about this, but I went to Pre-E3, everything went fine, never got sick. And I know his lymph nodes were so swollen up, and of course that's weird, but it was convention season. Pre-E3 means E3's coming, means Comic-Cons coming, means VidCon is coming, means Comic-Cons coming, it means PAX is coming. It means everything was happening at once where I didn't have time.

I knew they were swollen up, I knew that was weird, I knew I'd get back to it later, and kept going, kept going, kept going. And then these photos with us in blue are my friend Poe's wedding. Who knows Poe from the podcast? Talked about him a lot, right? Poe's here in the black cap in the middle. This is a bachelor party up in the Wisconsin Dells, because we know how to party in Chicago. Ah, and at the wedding, I went, we came into Chicago. It was me and Christine, girlfriend at the time, and she had never been to Chicago before, so we decided to do all the touristy stuff I had actually never done before the wedding.

I felt like I had vertigo. And I'm not usually the kind who like freaks out at heights looking down outside of just window. I thought, \"That's weird,\" whatever. Walked away. We went down on Michigan Avenue. Christine for Christmas has gotten a gift card to a very expensive purse shop. Whenever I tell the story, she used to yell at me because I told the wrong purse shop. I used to say Coach, and I believe that's not expensive or impressive at all, but I assure you it was an impressive purse place on Michigan Avenue. And we went in there, and I was looking at all this stuff, talking, and she's like, \"I'm gonna look at those over there.\" I'm like, \"All right, I'm gonna sit down.\" And so I sat down, and I Googled, \"What are heart attack symptoms?\" because the",

And I was, my fear of course was, I didn't want to be the guy who books an ambulance on Michigan Avenue during his best friend's wedding, and it turns out that I'd eaten some bad sushi or something stupid. So you go to heart attack symptoms, pulsating walls inside the purse shop, not one of them. I said, \"I'm gonna let it ride. I'll be all right. No need to get cut into, into big trouble here. I don't want a big expensive bill. Don't need to worry about it.\" So I felt better, drank some water, went on, did this wedding, and you see us here in these amazing blue tuxes right here, and there's blue stuff here, and yes, I did buy this, and I was like, \"I'll justify the laser pointer,\" and there it is, these blue things we're wearing.",

And it was going fine, everything's great. It was a reunion. I hadn't seen a lot of these friends since high school, some since college. And one of them, my friend Noonan, who I talked about on the podcast a lot too, he's a doctor at the time, just in medical school. But at the reception for Poe's wedding, which is about 30 more of these Bud Lights later, I was sitting there talking to him, and I was like, \"Oh yeah,\" and I finally opened up to someone that, \"Hey, yeah, the walls of the place we're pulsating, and I, I've had this swollen things.\" Like, \"Really?\" He's like, he's like, \"That's not normal.\" And I'm like, \"I know, it's helpful a doctor says that.\" And he said, \"Well, stand up, and I'll give you a check right now.\" So I stood up, we're drunk as hell at this wedding, people already jumped in the pool in these same outfits, and",

I would get it looked at. I'm not gonna say what I think it would have anything like that, but why?\" And as he's going through this, trying to be like, \"You very much need to go to a doctor,\" one of the other groomsmen's girlfriends walked behind us and goes, \"What's going on?\" And, \"Oh my god, I got these lumps on my neck, and he's rubbing you down.

You go there, you're like, \"This is the worst thing, this is the end.\" Out of that, I hadn't done that. I was going in there totally prepared for it to be, \"Yep, it's gonna be nothing. He's gonna tell me I'm stupid, get out of the room, don't waste my time, yada yada yada.\" And I had gone in there for a separate thing, a little skin rash or whatever, like a dry patch of dry skin that I was way more worried about than a neck thing in the walls.

And that's not what you want to see a doctor do, especially when they're right here. Eyes go wide, and ****, this guy's interested now.

It was gross to think about. But Greg Miller, just like, \"No big deal, rash on the leg though, this is where we got to **** focus.\" And the doctor's like, \"Oh,\" and so way lit up, way too excited about all this, and walked over, opened the drawer, came back with a little ruler, put it there, measured it, more questions about how long this had been there, what was going on, all these different things.

The medical system here tends to move slow. I've had, when I'll talk about him later, cancer scare since then, where, \"Oh my god, I panic, 'cause everything now, everything's **** cancer.\" You know what I mean? Portillo sneezes, I'm like, \"Am I sick?\" And I was like, \"Okay, whatever. I'm, when is this happening? Is it next week?\" This is happening on a Friday, if memory serves me right. And he's like, \"No, no, we're gonna get even quicker than that.\" And at that same point, the nurse walks in with a Post-it Note, and she hands me the note and says, \"You have an MRI in an hour and a half,\" and I",

And so then it all began downhill from there. Not downhill, but this is a photo I've never shared. I took it at that doctor's office before I left. They drew blood to start running things, and I took it thinking I'd tweet it out, it'd be funny about it, tweet, \"Look at this, I'm getting blood drawn.\" And I was like, \"Well, on the off chance this gets serious, let's not do, let's not cause public hysteria or whatever.\" And so then the next stop was this MRI thing. And the MRI, man, that's when you really know, this is when the story comes together of like how bad things are.

And I'm in there getting bombarded with whatever an MRI does, I didn't look it up. And it suddenly ends, but I don't come out. I just sit in there, everything's off, nothing's happening, but I'm sitting inside this tube like this. I'm like, \"Huh, okay.\" About five minutes go by, five turns into seven, and I'm, I finally comes over the radio, \"Oh hey man, nothing's wrong, don't worry, we just want to go a little bit lower, so we're working on that.\" \"All right, no problem, I got nowhere to be.

He's like, \"All right, we couldn't get hold of them, but you can just come on out. We're gonna send you home.\" Looking all right. Come all the way out, get out. As soon as I hit the parking lot, I call Noonan, the doctor, and I'm like, \"Hey, what do you know about MRIs?\" He's like, \"Well, not a lot, but enough.\" And I'm like, \"When they're giving it to you, they give you a preview, right?\" He's like, \"Yeah.\"",

They need to go lower, they need to know how deep it is, but they don't have the, you know, sign off to do that.\" I was like, \"All right, cool, so I know it's bad.\" And again, this is a Friday night, awesome, great timing, right? The one thing about the medical system is, at least my medical system, it moves fast when it wants to, and when it has access to the Internet, 'cause I have a follow-up appointment on Monday afternoon to find out what exactly is going on.

It looks like it's protruding into the armpit, down into the abdomen, all these different things.\" And this is the first time, and maybe the only time in the diagnosis thing where I get choked up.

So the stats already start popping up that this probably isn't all that bad. It looks like it's going to be, I'm gonna get sick, this is gonna happen, I'm gonna fight this, it's no big deal. And of course, the reason I think it's no big deal, and I know if you're a fan, you've heard this story before, but I'm gonna try to go more in-depth than before, it's because of Tim Grant.

A reporter from the Tribune had followed him and had chronicled his amazing story of beating neuroblastoma. And like, of course, if you're not, if you've never read this story, right, this is Tim's family home in Hallsville, Missouri. It's a small place. He's got, he's got two working parents, they're trying to make this go. They have two kids, Tim's one of them, the oldest there. They're the middle of America, you think about that, people talk about, right? They just want to live a nice simple life. This hits them incredibly hard, obviously impacts the entire community.

And I know that might seem stupid now, I always talk about them, you know, like, but 50/50 hadn't come out yet. I had never seen chemotherapy before.

Is the fact that I, you know, I didn't want kids until I met Jen and marry Jen and all this stuff. But like meeting Tim, Tim was the first one ever where I was like, \"Oh my god, if I wanted a child, I'd want this boy.\" He loves video games, he loves comics, he's playing his 3DS all the time.

Tim's aggressive therapy means he and his mother must spend two hours a day in the hospital, and they're nice at Hope Lodge, quarters for patients and their families operated by the American Cancer Society.

The IV is on wheels, and Tim maneuvers it around the floor like a pro. He drinks milk, watches TV, and tries to act as if he's not in pain. Quote, \"He does hurt, but he won't tell us,\" as Julie Birch, a clinical nurse coordinator at the center. \"It's not only that he's correct, courageous, he thinks we'll keep him in his chair watching TV.\" Tim shifts and tucks his leg under his frail body. He grimaces one too many times,",

He grimaces one too many times, and Birch moves in and fills a needleless syringe with red goop, Oxycodone for the pain. Tim squirts it into his own mouth. \"What's it taste like, Tim?\" asks her son. Tim sticks out his tongue. It makes a face. \"Yucky?\" she asks. Her son nods as he plays with toy trucks on a windowsill. I'm sorry, as he plays with toy trucks on a windowsill. Tim doesn't really know how sick he is. When it's time to for a trip to University of St. Louis or the University Hospital, he knows it's because of the black and blue bruises and lumps on his body, but no one has told him his life is in danger. Quote, \"I'm sure he knows in his own way, but he's just not letting on,\" Tammy says later. Back at home in Hallsville, we're jumping ahead now a little bit.

They've been going on getting their treatment throughout here. We've been talking to everybody, and now they're playing Life. Tammy and Damian. Tim as Tim digs through the box and distributes the multicolored money at random. Birch stops to take his blood pressure, temperature, impulse the vitals. The vitals check is repeated every 15 minutes during Tim's daily sessions of chemotherapy. A thermometer under his arm, clip on his finger, and tubes running into his chest. Tim tries to stay pleasant, but it's hard. Tammy says grumpiness comes as a side effect of the pain medication. \"I can do it, Mom,\" Tim snaps as he pulls Life cards from his mom's hand and fidgets with the devices fastened to his body. \"Are we done yet?\" \"No, another minute,\" Tammy says about the underarm thermometer. \"Mom, I want to move this arm,\" Tim pleads with a tone most children use to beg for candy.",

Went to the kitchen table to work before I went actually to get the chemotherapy. Open Twitter and it in there, there was a mention from a guy I never worked with The Tribune but works there now that was just, 'Greg, I need to talk to you. Irene's dead.' And I couldn't process it. I couldn't understand what he meant. I just talked to her and she beaten so many things. Like, what if she was gonna die? I would be spectacular. Obviously, that's the only way she would want it. But it wasn't. She slipped, hit her head, went in, passed away. And so I get all this information and it's like, 'Well, guess what? Fucking fucking chemotherapy, I'm flying back to Columbia.

You are not allowed to do that! You cannot do that! It's not gonna happen! Bah bah bah!' And so I'm an emotional wreck. Go to chemotherapy that day, get into the chair, sit down and the woman comes in, a nurse, to give me my thing. And she dives into my arm, digs around with the needle, can't find the vein. Comes the other arm, digs around the needle, can't feel the vein. Goes to hand, no vein. Goes the other hand, no vein. Bring somebody else in. They do it all over again. Can't do it.

And they explained at the time, a port is the thing you put in your chest like Tim had, right? Tim is actually in his belly for journalistic integrity. But for me, it would have been, it would be in my chest, which would be a direct line right to my heart for all the chemotherapy. No more need to go into my veins or do any more needles.' And at the time they said this, but I was on schedule for a six-month treatment. So I was like, 'Well, that seems like a lot of work to go put a port in it if my veins are gonna work.'

If this ever happens to you or someone, I recommend the port. Saves time. But since I don't have a port, they need to schedule the port. I can't get the chemotherapy that weekend and I get to go home and say goodbye to Irene. And for me personally, and I'm not pushing any agendas, but whenever you hear me talk on GOG, GameOverGreggy, your show about God, G.O.D., this is one of those things I'm talking about where I find it interesting that there are so many coincidences.

So just a heads up, like we know one of the things to take away from this panel, be there for people.

I started to go to conventions again. Started having fun again with Jim Riley, of course. And then of course, Nolan North comes by from Up at Noon. But the main thing is I start transitioning back into real life. And as I said before in this panel, I start forgetting everything that happened. It starts to become a distant, more and more distant memory. And so there's always this weird thing that happens when somebody talks to me about the cancer and that they say is like, 'Well, what did you learn from it? Like what was your big takeaway from it?' And I always felt like, 'Wow, what a weird question that is.' What? Like, I don't, I, I never felt like my life was threatened, right? Like I feel like Tim",

But it wasn't like I walked away being like, 'You know what? Bananas aren't that bad.' Like it wasn't like there was no giant takeaway, no life-changing reaffirming for her. So I thought. But coming up on this panel, I thought more and more, more about my story in a way I've never thought about it before. And so last weekend coming back from Las Vegas, I watched a little movie, on my preferred, you know, way, on a little Virgin America screen. It's called The Fault in Our Stars.

And I get why you would not again that I've faced the cancer as severe as theirs. But I get why that would be the takeaway for somebody who hopefully hasn't heard the story, that hopefully doesn't understand something about this. What I love about this is that both characters, right, they understand how precious every day is. They know it's about to end. They know to live for the moment. They know to do the crazy thing.

Like, 'TotalBiscuit's up for it again. He's, he just got diagnosed with a terminal cancer.' And Tim was like, 'Fuck yeah, we do this. Do you want?' And I'm like, 'Yeah, I want it.' And he's like, 'Let's go for it! Why wouldn't you go for it?' And I was like, 'You're right. Why wouldn't I?'
