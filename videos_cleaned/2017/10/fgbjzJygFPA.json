As YouTube continues to evolve, we will work to provide you timely information to help you manage your account with a Nintendo Creators Program. What the ****? What the **** is this? Two steps forward, five steps back. No, why? I don't know, man. It's like it's one of those things where it's so banning it, I can't even really rationalize that in my head. I think the only reason that they would is you can't really control live streams when it comes to embargoes and stuff that gets even more complicated when it's like, oh, well, you can put up 11 minute video, but your stream could be this long above a block that's like you",

All right, let me take a step back here. Take it back, take it, dial it back. What Nintendo is like, hey, here's the embargoes, here's the rules on how we're gonna let you stream or do whatever. Every time we get a game, it's always like you can have a max of ten minutes and you can't show menus and you can't have this cutscene, you can't do that. Somehow you went so Super Mario. Yeah, you're gonna play for an hour and a half. You get to use ten minutes of footage. Yeah, and not from this world. You can't do that live because you need to be able to edit. There's no way that you're gonna know when a menu pops, sure, when it cutscenes gonna trigger and that would be an impossible situation to live switch that back and forth, especially if you're just a streamer doing this stuff. Now here's the situation where",

These are games like I don't, you would probably be more versed for something the YouTube guy let alone than a Nintendo guy in the Creators Program. Creators Program I thought was, hey Nintendo, I make mute YouTube videos, I like to play games on YouTube, I'm gonna sign up for this program and it's I give you 30% of the revenue and I take 70. That sounds right. Okay, that's actually I don't know about that. I think it's it's closer to 5050. Okay, Kinda Funny comm slash you're wrong on the on the actual details of the infinite.

Yeah, come on guys, like just give in to this. I concede this. What's that thing to where I like when the Creators Program launched, I remember being like that's incredibly stupid, petty. I don't know. Now I wasn't angry, but I'm like, come on, that's a dumb move, a dumb decision and it's settled and for I forgotten all about it, you know what I mean? And we put up YouTube videos and I'm not sure if we're getting cleaned based on this. They totally get clean today. We are lucky that we run our business through Patreon. Yes, so in the tips and Twitch sub, absolutely all of those things are that's the revenue that we look at. We look we get we make money on YouTube like we make good",

And a lot of people ask us recently, yeah, a lot of people have been asking on Reddit and stuff where it's like, oh man, like is the ad apocalypse affecting Kinda Funny? Oh yeah, it definitely is. We're getting demonetized left and right for things that doesn't even make sense. Yeah, like the example I keep using is a game of a Greg Miller Show topic called should you or what is Movie Pass with a thumbnail that was just a movie theater demonetised before it even went live to in to bring this up to speed. There might be people who out there who are more games focused than YouTube focus.

Yeah, and it's like no one really knows exactly what they're searching through, but it sounds like there's they're doing actual audio scrubs listening for swear words. That's the only reason that I mean, yeah, because we curse all the time. Yeah, and they deem that not friendly to advertisers. Gosh, it's this whole thing. So yeah, we're definitely taking a huge hit from that stop. So the Patreon stuff goes such a long way, but Nintendo was just doing that personally for a long time where they would be that's what the creative program is is where for us for example, like we're not part of the creative program because being part of it limits you in other ways like you're not allowed to have certain things.

We're not about making the money off of that content. So that right here then the deal here is with what this new thing is basically if you do this, you're not gonna be part of the program and then we take all the money. Yeah, okay, just make spelling it out for people. Uh yeah, exactly. I mean my thing is I I don't even know I don't know the details and we it's gonna roll out and we'll see how this actually affects things.
