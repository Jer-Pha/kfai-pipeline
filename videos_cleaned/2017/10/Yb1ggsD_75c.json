Well, I think we announced it yesterday, but Party Mode, you may have heard of it. It's a show I produce. Get to it. Come on, you're dragging down the show. Get on the pace of show a couple awards.

And two, we did a really fun thing with this one where we actually filmed multiple cameras, multiple desks, multiple feeds and Andy cut it together. Now what he said to me was this, Nick, this is an awesome Party Mode. I never want to do this ever again, ever. To which I replied, unfortunately, people are gonna really like this. Okay, Andy, I have a feeling you're gonna have to do this a lot. But this, if I'm not mistaken, Andy, are we doing a two-parter on this? Yes, two weeks.

And what I also didn't realize was he took a lot of flack back in the day for making very Hollywood movies that didn't have a lot of heart, which I would disagree with. Don't think a lot of people just thought that a lot of critics gave him **** for it for like ruining film. Yeah, for basically, I said why blockbuster is like really invented that essentially. And he was one of the people that popularized that, him and George Lucas.

We're kind of killing off some of the fill, the types of films from the 70s, like the late 70s and early 80s that were like, it's only good made in the era. So it's like everybody blames him for them. Yeah, they kind of, they kind of, you know, blame him for, for knocking some people off-track. And of course, then they talk about what I thought was fascinating about it was that a lot, all of his films, even the ones that were very, you know, that you wouldn't necessarily think have a deeper message like for instance, Indiana Jones: Last Crusade, have a lot to do with some of the personal things that he went through.

It was still a dick considering how long he hadn't seen him floor. Well, yeah, you know, it's a great scene on the Zeppelin where he's like, you know, the last time you and I sat here and had a quiet drink together, I had a milkshake, which means he was a child.

And I didn't quite realize that, but it makes sense given that when I was at like, most of the films were about children that were my age when I was watching those films where I read even Close Encounters is about a dad who would be into this family. Yeah, exactly. There's a lot like that. That's crazy, right? It's weird to think about. Go back everyone, watch that document. Although actually, I'm sure people are talking about in the chat right now. But what the ****, I got it. **** Temple of Doom. What's that? You know, the little kid who doesn't have a dad there.

And of course, still killing it and play it on a GoSee Blade Runner. I don't know what No Malone is, but for the love of God, what a great title. I'm gonna go see that this weekend, why not? I also, so I, in addition to not liking really great movies, I also really like disaster movie. Let's go see Geostorm. F*** yeah, see you. We saw the preview for that in Blade Runner, I think. I forgot to say next, I was like, I want a Geostorm, like a car in the 90s. Yes, it was the chance or that was just like a huge ruse and you get there. It's just like I documented because I know this was like what must have been a crazy weather system, it's like we control the water. What if at one point it starts raining Geostorms?

Mm-hmm, but still has the round mouthfeel that a Chardonnay. Yeah, now here's another follow-up question for this. As a person who doesn't drink a lot of wine, do people just hate Chardonnay because it's the only one that actually tastes good? How many types of wine have you actually tried? Like, I'd also work at a restaurant that had a great wine list that they made me try every time. Just one. I worked at multiple restaurants, but one of the restaurants that I worked at was a restaurant we talked about yesterday, the show called Bertolini's. They had a phenomenal wine list.

So all I can taste when I drink wine is the actual alcohol because it's the most, it's the most like heavy portion of the taste, the taste profile, flavor profile. So when I drink Chardonnay, I'm like, okay, this tastes sweet, so it actually tastes like something versus when I drink like a deep Zinfandel that just, it just hits me with just pure alcohol. I can't taste anything else. I don't get black currants. I don't get Cheerios. I don't get, I don't get f***ing carrots or whatever the hell else they over there, which by the way, is a happy, is a good thing. That's huge.

Um, so my all-time favorite, I will drink no matter what, is Sauvignon Blanc. Okay, there are a bunch of different styles. Um, I really like French Sauvignon Blancs, but I also like California Sauvignon Blancs are a little bit, you know, more dry. I used to be really big until like the New Zealand Marlborough County, like Sauvignon Blanc, but they got a little too citrusy for me. So now when I drink them, they almost are a little on the sour side. That's a varietal. If you put it in front of me, I will, I would never turn away. I'm gonna guess, when I wager a guess, if people don't like Chardonnays, they especially don't like Rieslings. Is that the case? Not necessarily.
