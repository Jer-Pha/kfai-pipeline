Deglaze with white wine, add sprigs of thyme and bring to a boil. Add mussels, cover pan with lid. Steam for 4-5 minutes or until mussels start opening up, gradually transferring them to shallow serving bowls as they open. After 8-10 minutes, discard any that have not opened. \n\nOnce all mussels have been taken out of the pan, add cream and stir, bringing sauce to a simmer. Season with salt & pepper, and ladle mix onto mussels in serving bowls. Serve with buttered, charred slices of crusted bread, fries on the side. \n\nFRIES INGREDIENTS\n- Canola oil for frying (enough to submerge fries in a deep pan) \n- 2 yukon gold potatoes, cut in long sticks\n- Kosher salt\n- Pepper\n- Rosemary or other herbs if you're feeling crazy.\n\nFRIES STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS\n1) Dice dem taters into sticks. Y;know, the size of fries you'd wanna eat.\n2) Toss the finished sticks into a bowl of cold water to destarch them. Dump out the cloudy water, put more cold water in. Repeat until the water in the bowl is no longer cloudy.\n3) Over in your cast iron skillet, dump in a good layer of canola oil. You want to submerge the fries, but you don't need to overdo it. Heat over medium high.\n4) While the oil is heating up, pull the fries out of the water and put'em on a clean towel. Pat them dry.\n5) OK, the oil's hot? Great. Put the fries in carefully. Don't overcrowd. You'd going to do this in batches.\n6) Once the fries change texture (they'll go from glossy to matte), pull them out and put them on a paper towel.\n7) Put in the next batch. Do it again.\n8) OK, start tossing in the partially fried fries. Let'em go until they're the brown and crispy fries you like. \n9) Pull'em out, toss'em back on a paper towel, and salt, pepper, and herb those bad boys.\n10) Serve!\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids",
