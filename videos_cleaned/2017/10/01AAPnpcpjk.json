See Peter and Miles working together when he brings them together. South the Kingpin saw a whole bunch of characters in a good trailer in terms of here's a taste of that world. Yet again, what I really appreciate about Spider-Man from Insomniac, right how they're promoting it is they're like Mr. Negative, here's Mr. Negative blowing this up. It's an Osborn mayor rally, he blows up some stuff and it's like we already know that's not the main villain. He's a villain in this world in this game.

I I I want I'm looking for something a bit more traditional at least when it comes to the villains at least for boss fights or appearances and we'll see way too early.

I think that out of the context of it being next to Detroit and Erica and Last of Us and all these things are like holy **** the character models look amazing. Yeah, maybe it won't be that distracting but I think it's what for me or that I had a similar reaction to it where I was like this doesn't look right why not?
