How, when did this change for you and when did your 'I don't give a ****' attitude of amazing Miller confidence become about? Um, I would say probably I wasn't happy with my performance in high school. In high school, I was quiet. I didn't, I wasn't as outgoing as I probably should have been. I'd gotten braces and then gotten this metal plate and like separator spreader thing on top my mouth which made it really hard to talk. So I kind of went quiet except for like for my friends and, you know, my group of friends. And so by the time I graduated high school, it's like, 'I don't want to be this thing. I don't want to be this kid,' you know what I mean? And I was also in uniforms and all other ****. And so it was like, 'What do I like about myself? Let's double down, let's do that.'

I came in with blue hair, a Hawaiian shirt every day, more jorts and tube socks and all that stuff. Like college would definitely be the turning point. I would say freshman year, going in there just being like, I thought it was liberating to go away from home, be six hours from anyone I knew, you know, be, you have to completely start over, force myself to be like I was talking about that, you know, freshman year, that first Friday where the kid, the few, the two friends I had made, they went away for back home for the weekend.

I'm just like being confident in getting out there and doing all that, hell. Um, in terms of like taking my shirt off and being stupid, not being self-conscious and stuff like that, the antlers were a huge part of that. It was a, you know, I've talked about them a lot and like being crazy sports fans and all these different things. But, you know, I don't tell them, of course, it doesn't matter. They're a bunch of dumb college kids, they can't see me.

So it's like that's where they came from, right? It was like nice to be around that, a group of acceptance and like that's what it was. So that was it. College. College is the answer. You've got to fake it till you make it, Jamie. Number two, there are a lot of Best Friends out there and I'm one of them. I'm pretty self-conscious. I worry a lot about being too big a fan, being annoying, posting too much or showing my appreciation too much. I love the Best Friends and I do, I do love all of Kinda Funny. It all comes from a place of respect and thinking you are all the bee's knees. Basically, do we need a safety word and have you ever had a problem with super fans without naming names? I want to be supportive",

Um, don't worry about that. That's the least of your concerns of being too supportive. Trust me, it, trust me, that's not the problem. It's the kids who are very angry about things, who want to cut down at every corner. They're the ones they like, 'All right, can you look in the mirror and think about what you're doing?' You're fine being supportive, son. And if you're one of the kids who's, I don't know, it's always the thing. I always say something like that and then somebody like, 'Well, I'm critical of them. Am I the problem?' You're not the problem. It's you. Trust me, there's the what you are on the spectrum isn't that, it's the far-flung one over here who's",

In terms of having a superfan problem, no. And I just go back, this is the big, this is the craziest thing about Kinda Funny that if it all closed up tomorrow and I went and worked in a coffee shop for the rest of my life, do you understand? You know, it's the same thing, you know, I feel like I bring this a lot of time, but like how much I believe in the Best Friend mantra and how much I believe if you've watched this boring-ass AMA of me just talking this long, you're a Best Friend. You're hanging out with your friend Greg Miller and I'm hanging out my friend you on the other side of the camera.

You came to the house I, I lived in, that Colin lived in, that his girlfriend at the time lived in, that Steiner lived in at the time, that Portillo lived in. Like you knew where we worked every day. You were right there. Most of time I gave you my phone number. And so I figured something I like, like that's the level of trust we have in you all like that. And that's why it's been that no, I've never had a Best Friend that it's like, 'Oh, like what do you do?'

So it goes without saying, you have helped a ton of people. My question is, do you consider yourself a real-life superhero? We all know superheroes have powers and help people in the world and you have helped out so many people in the community and in the world. You have even helped me become who I am today and saving me from depression. You've saved other people from depression, suicide, and major medical issues.

No, because there's so many people, not even so many people that are gonna be negative, but like the off-base criticism we're feeling, we're always on the defense or something. That's what wears you down and runs you down, right? Like again, I'm, um, I'm on my best behavior and not my best behavior. I'm in my best moment right now.

You know, I'm making these MasterChef, I made this MasterChef audition video. So let me send it in and I'm down. But then I watch MasterChef and these people just rattling off things and words I don't know. I'm like, 'I don't know if I made it.
