Not too much, wearing a little Star Wars shirt. You like them? Star Wars Day? Yeah, is it? No, it's not. It's not May the Fourth or whatever. No trailer, no new. What's new? What's happening to you? I'm gonna go to a Macklemore concert tonight. Oh, my first Macklemore concert in, in like three years. You used to go to all, so he used to go to, and you, then you're the guy who led the thing. He sold out. You were the opposite, that guy. I couldn't go to the last one, yeah, the last two because there was during kind of my life, which is weird. So where are you seeing him tonight? The Warfield, which is my favorite San Francisco venue. Okay, yeah, is it big? It is. It's, you, I sell these stories, used to see you Macklemore was like, well, you and ten people in there.

Four items on the Roper Report, a baker's dozen. Nice. In stereo. Very good. Number one, the ESRB has ruled and says loot boxes aren't gambling. This is via Kotaku, Jason Schreier, of course. What goes as follows: ESRB does not consider loot boxes to be gambling, said an ESRB spokesperson in an email to Kotaku. While there's an element of chance in these mechanics, the player is also guaranteed to receive in-game content, parentheses, even if the player unfortunately receives something they don't want. We think of it, and we think of it as a similar principle to collectible card games. Sometimes you open a pack and get a brand new holographic card you've had your eyes on for a while, but other times you'll end up with a pack of cards you already have. They package it all around there. Interesting. Well, it's one of those things, my gut tells me when I hear this,",

This goes back to, I mean, Kinda Funny Games Daily could easily be retitled Kinda, because we do it. But on one of the times we've talked about this, I brought this up, that I understand what people are saying in terms of, oh, it's gambling, it's put, it's preying on gambling tendencies. I think literally it is not gambling. I think ESRB is, they make the rules and regulations and figure out how they want to look at games and what kind of lens. I think they have to play by those rules, and that's the same thing here. Yeah, I don't think it is, and I don't think you can make the case that it is.

Also, I think it's funny, how much do you think, do you think loot crate the business is excited or disheartened? But I've often thought about that. It's just like, I don't know. I think definitely did something right with, with the marketing of it. But it's like, now when things are getting for now, it's like a dirty word, and every talking on which the eight loot boxes.

PC Gamer had an article titled, Behind the Addictive Psychological and Seductive Art of Loot Boxes. In the article, Dr. Luke Clark, director of the Center for Gambling Research at the University of British Columbia, says, quote, the player is basically working for reward by making a series of responses, but the rewards are delivered unpredictably. We know that the dopamine system, which is targeted by drugs of abuse, is also very interested in unpredictable rewards. Dopamine cells are most active when there is maximum uncertainty, and the dopamine system responds more to an uncertain reward than the same reward delivered on a predictable basis. Unquote.

Hmm, an interesting wrinkle to the question when we get into psychology, addictive nature, dopamine systems, stuff I usually don't talk about when I talk about still not gambling, right? So, but that's the thing is like, okay, so this opens up a different question. Is it wrong for businesses to prey on addiction? Sure. And I think that the, the answer to that is yes. But are they doing? Other question is, it's not illegal, and it's not. But, and I get that, and like this, they are doing here. Absolutely. You think so? Yeah.

No. But, but everything, I'm gonna go back, this is when we talked about gambling before, not we, but I mean, Kinda Funny Games, you know, I forget if you're actually on the episode. That was my counterpoint to this, is that great? And by this logic, I think you and me and everyone else can go file a class-action suit against supermarkets across the world because on the way out there, the capsule machines, and goddamn, I want that hot Superman sticker, and I put it in, and I wrecked a dick, and it comes out, it's Batman.

I'm just like, there's a two-for-one deal, which makes you want to buy two instead of one. It's like, no, it, these are all just things where it comes to psychology.

As the heated debate around loot boxes and crates continues, I thought it would be a good idea to give an example of a game I feel does loot boxes right. Brawlhalla. First of all, all the microtransactions in this revolve around cosmetic items like skins. Now you can about, now you can buy almost every skin individually, but a few of them are exclusive to loot boxes. These loot boxes contain 15 regular skins and 3",

These loot boxes contain 15 regular skins and 3 exclusive skins for 18 skins in total. Buying a box will get you one of these skins at random. All, all have an equal chance of being obtained. And parentheses, this is the most important part, there are no doubles. Because of this system, you always know what you're getting into. If you really want that exclusive skin, you might get lucky and get on the first try. But if you don't, at least you know you only have to buy 18 boxes tops. Plus, most of the other skins cost 40% more if you buy them individually. So you're still getting a good deal if you don't get the skin you want. Curse to hear your thoughts on this system.

I understand as a season. I, I feel there's a way to do this right where it's not the worst thing in the world. And that's all I want to do is we can send you down this trend that in this argument because we're going, it's going to get worse before it gets better. We're gonna see more people fuck this up and do stupid things before we get to people actually having a system or anything. I just hate the idea that we're sitting here and we're looking to adults in quotes to solve this problem rather than looking to each other and how we can inform and make the buying decisions and make the our voices and wallets heard to the, to these companies, right?

And I grant that you can earn them in-game, but you can buy them and get them that way. And our counter-argument was like, that's one way to do it. But I think playing the game and not spending the money on the crate speaks louder absolutely than just ignoring the game altogether because then they don't even have, you know, data. They have, you don't have your survey in the pots. And, and so to sit here and be like, start leaning on the argument lights, it's a taking advantage of kids that it's, it's, is it gambling or not?

When people stopped playing split-screen, like local split-screen, they stopped putting it in the game.

EA being lazy or as a Nintendo hardware too weak to support the main features that we have come to expect. Love the show. I hope you all visit England one day. I'd love to meet you. Cheers, Andrew. EA being lazy 100%. And I say that because we see what all these other people are doing. Was your chance. Granted, the Bethesda games aren't out yet, but from all impressions of people that have played Doom, people I know that have played Doom, people that have played Skyrim, they run great. They look great. And it this is on EA being like, hey, FIFA sells. Let's put a game that sells on the Switch. People, I hate to call any developer or publisher or anybody lazy. We don't know what's going on in there. I've never met a game dev who's like, whoa, **** it. I don't care. Just push that. Nice. Of course, at you. There's definitely precedents. There's definitely publishers at the top or precedents at the top of publishers.",
