Really need to be anything on it really, but it but it detracts from the fun side quests like finding those weird Japanese. But yeah, we're good. Fair enough. I think my might topped out at 741. Jesus Christ. But you'll see, you'll start it starts compiling really quickly there. Ryan Sayntelli says, \"Greg, what's your thoughts on Chili?\" It sucks. It's terrible. It looks like diarrhea. It doesn't have a good taste. Beans are gross. I'll tell you so much later that is the thicker the better sometimes. And I'm not even lying when I say this, sometimes I'll buy a can of chili that I like and I'll open up the can and I'll eat it cold like a hobo. You're crazy. And I **** I love it. I love it. I love cold chili. I love everything cold. It's disgusting.",

And you know what? I like to pretend like I'm Mad Max from The Road Warrior. All right. Jams the Kuma says, \"Did Greg ever finish Undertale?\" No, jumped in again. Nice. That intro I do not like. And so I bounced out and went played a Clunker or whatever calling a master on Switch. Man, so erm is something else at the on that trip. People tell me I got a playthrough power through. Eddy G. Brazil, so the house Cuphead. I haven't started it. I have it downloaded, but I'm starting excited about Cuphead. No, it's one of those that Tim Tim's talked of it like maybe go, \"Okay, I'm actually I'll try it.\" 'Cause it was one of those it totally deterred me from the fact that Tim's getting",

He's like, \"I can't.\" It's he beat it. It's the most rewarding game I've lit where I am able to go through only get my head kicked in, but then go beyond and like, \"Okay, yeah.\" 'Cause like it just looks tough like and I just don't I don't like games are like, \"We're gonna **** torture you.\" Yeah, their souls. Yeah, sure. Let's do one more. Did you read this is somebody in here. Doctor Funder says, \"Required reading Batman: The Long Halloween.\" No, required reading we already said was Preacher Vol. 1. However, how did you do Batman: White Knight yet? No, I just saw a lot of people tweeting about that. It's good. You show you a month. Is it good? Yeah, I like it a lot. It's a, you know, Joker story. Bat misconduct reading. It's interesting. I like you. I'm looking forward where they go. Okay, well, there's one more. I thought I saw",

And then Slightly Sausage says, \"Any news on getting Greg on MasterChef?\" No, I need to make my video since I can't make it in the open casting calls. I need actually filming. You mean Nick, we're talking about it. Hopefully we'll do it Friday. Yeah, we're looking at we're targeting Friday for that. Yeah, now we're trying to get Gordon Ramsay himself to show up and be in the video because I feel like that'd be really cool. Yeah, way to get you on the show. Sure, just knew him. Why not? Yeah, he'll be easy. He follows me, but maybe I'll work against me. I don't think so though because I feel like yes, he does. I feel like you want to work with the people you know that'll come through, you know. And let's be perfectly honest, it is a show that is produced, so they do want compelling people, I would think",

You can't just keep casting people out of **** Portland, you know what I'm sure know. Maybe it's time to give star. Maybe it's time to give San Francisco a shot. Gordon Ramsay, you know what? You know what I'm gonna do to JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey's dad? Nope, no, no, no, not not the same person. Geoff Ramsey's brother. Yes, there you go. We go. I'm gonna tweet at Gordon Ramsay. We're gonna end this show right here. Okay, there's been the Kinda Funny Morning Show. Great one. I'm gonna tweet at Gordon Ramsay about, \"Hey, how am I doing with Cooking with Greggy?\" And give them a link to the playlist or whatever. It kind of a couple of cold thumbnails.
