If you don\u2019t have a butcher, remove the membrane when you get home. This is the white film/skin on the back of the ribs. Just slide your knife under there and then pull with your fingers. This too weird for you? Fuck it. Just makes the ribs more tender. You\u2019ll survive if you don\u2019t do it.\n2) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. \n3) Line a glass pan with aluminum foil.\n4) Season the ribs with you rub.\n5) Place the ribs in the pan and add some water to it. About a fourth of an inch.\n6) Cover the pan with aluminum foil, and put them in the oven for an hour.\n7) After that hour, pull the pan out, take off the top, increase the temperature to 375, and cook for 15 more minutes.\n8) Pull the pan out, slather on some sauce, and broil on high until the sauce is bubblin\u2019 good (five minutes tops).\n9) Cut\u2019em up, add more sauce, and serve\n \nINGREDIENTS FOR COLESLAW\nHalf a Red cabbage\nHalf a Green cabbage\n3 Carrots\nWhite wine vinegar\nVegetable Oil\nOnion salt\nCelery salt\nGarlic powder\n\u00bd a lemon\u2019s juice\nSugar\nSalt and Pepper\n1 tbsp grilled or black sesame seeds\n\nSTEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS (COLESLAW)\n1) Remove outer leaves of red & green cabbages, rinse\n2) Slice cabbage thinly and take apart with fingers\n3) Wash and shred the carrots\n4) Mix everything in large serving bowl, set aside. \n5) In a mason jar or other container with a lid, add 1 tablespoon vinegar for 3 tablespoons oil (increase quantities if larger portion is being served). Toss in lemon juice and seasonings, sugar. Shake well.\n5) Pour dressing on salad only when about to serve, mix well. Top with sesame seeds. \n\nINGREDIENTS FOR MAC AND CHEESE\n4 cups elbow macaroni (or short pasta of your choice, ideally curved) \n5 tbsp unsalted butter\n4 cups milk\n2 tbsp all purpose flour\n\u00bd cup accent cheese (the strong/pungent one, like aged gouda or sharp cheddar) \n1/2 cup grated gruyere, plus \u00bd cup in big chunks\n1 cup grated fontina\n\u00bd tsp grated nutmeg\n\u00bd cup panko crumbs\n\nSTEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS (MAC AND CHEESE)\n1) Get a solid 3-cheese foundation. One pungent (aged gouda or sharp cheddar), one mild (gruyere), one that melts really well (fontina). Grate it all. Drain and toss with 2 tbsp butter. Set aside.\n2) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\n3) Cook pasta in a large pot of salted, boiling water (about 5-7 minutes)\n4) Make a roux: In a large pot over medium heat add 2 tablespoons butter and the flour. Cook, stirring, for about 2 to 3 minutes; don't let the roux color. \n5) Pour milk onto the roux, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes until the sauce is thick.\n6) Add grated nutmeg to the sauce and stir.\n7) Remove from the heat and add the aged gouda, 1/2 the grated gruyere and 1/2 the fontina; stir until melted and smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.\n8) Pour mix over the pasta, add the chunks of gruyere, and mix until well blended. Put into the prepared baking dish. \n9) Sprinkle the remaining gruyere and fontina cheeses evenly over the top, add a little bit of panko for coloring. \n10) Bake until the top is golden and crusty, about 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids",

It's me, Greg Miller, and of course, uh, the reason these ribs are here is because they're very important in San Francisco, and I assume like many other places, you can't barbecue. We don't have a balcony, we don't have a point go that it's hard to barbecue in San Francisco. So as a meat lovin' and barbecue lovin' man myself, I had to figure out one day how to do it. I figured out a way to do ribs here inside that are awesome, it taste great, and are super super super simple, but look great when they're done. So we're starting there cuz the ribs take a while. We're gonna have to actually preheat the oven 3 5. I remember this time. Yeah, well he be surprising this show and then we have a I have took a half slab ribs. Of course, depends on how many people you're cooking for, what you want to do. Well what I use then is this dry rib or a rub here. This is of",

Well what I use then is this dry rib or a rub here. This is of course from Memphis itself. This is given to me by one Eric Castro, star of Follow the Leader, world-famous bartender at all time. Now it's one of those interesting things for you in terms of how much you want to use and it's gonna be how much barbecue sauce you like. I like to get a really good coating on there because Jen hung it on my ribs really really really good and I was surprised because they don't take that much effort either. No, yeah, that's what I love about them is that they are so simple. The only thing is the time commitment cuz it'll be at 3 5 an hour, then we're gonna crank it up to 375 for another 15 minutes and then I've been doing this new thing where I put the barbecue sauce on there and then broil them just a little bit but it's one of those you can it's a set it and forget it",

So what I have over here is just a regular glass baking dish and whatever you got you I line it you line it with tinfoil because that's what the recipe says you put the slab of ribs in there then to keep making that moisture hot you come over here to the sink make sure I think what the recipe calls for is like 1/4 of an inch of water all the way around and I'll come show you I don't I you you know I don't don't panic about it don't measure it don't do anything like that just get a good amount of water in there and the base to keep it reduced to keep them is going big only it's hard if I rotate it towards Nick it's gonna look like more water but trust me there's not that much water in there just a good base of water you see it",
