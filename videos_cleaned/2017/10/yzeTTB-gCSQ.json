Yeah, as of the time recording this on October 10th, '17, two very different situations in terms of spoiler or in terms of trailers and spoilers and all that. Star Wars: The Last Jedi theatrical trailer comes out. Maz Kanata's and Maz Kanata is not in it. Director Rian Johnson leading into this like for the last month or whatever had interviews or whatever said, \"Hey, you should avoid this trailer if you don't want to be spoiled.\" And it was always in a way that that was kind of forced out of them or like that's huge. Yeah, exactly. It was for the headline or whatever. And as I kept going, it would progress and you'd be like, \"Yeah, I mean, if you want to go into the movie, you don't want to know any completely blank, don't watch the trailers.\" And it's like you can see that about any movie, right? Ever, about any experience ever, job.",

Ever, about any experience ever, job. And then of course, the day that the trailer drops, he's like, \"Every, it's out now. Again, we'll go watch it. Forget everything else I said.\" And it's like, yeah, did he have to do that because it's Disney? I'm probably kind of, but it's like, all right, now for the first time ever that I've seen, there's an actual rebellion of the absolutely, that's what we do. We're a backlash form. This scene isn't in the movie on me. It's not, it's me, Jane Eyre. Oh, good lord, of people that are like, \"I'm not gonna watch this trailer, nail tech. I'm not watching this trailer. We're too close to this movie.\" That's 'cause you know these don't, Anthony Carboni, you know, let's spoil. So you didn't say that.

There's only a certain select few movies that you don't need to watch trailers for that you know everyone's gonna go see. It isn't like the Star Wars, you don't need to necessarily watch the trailer. But for a movie like, like from most other movies, like you gotta, you gotta put some spoilers in the trailer so you do. And so that's the other side of this conversation here is so Batman V Superman obviously spoils the entire movie. That's how trailers these days modern, all they made. But with the Star Wars trailer, which for the sake of this conversation, I don't really want to go into the trailer substance because there are people that don't even spoil it. At the end of the day, my one message is don't fuck with people. It's rule number three of the genie things, like be good. And if people don't want to be spoiled, don't",

But so the Blade Runner situation is the other thing where one of the the main arguments for why people think Blade Runner isn't doing well in the box office is the trailers don't explain jack. All the trailers say is who's in the movie and it's gonna be very stylish and cool to look cool. And that's that's it. And that doesn't put butts in seats. So I think that there's just an interesting thing here of when it comes to trailers, there's a trailer culture where yeah, everyone's gonna watch Star Wars. Like they don't need to put any, there doesn't need to be anybody be a lightsaber. Everyone's like, yeah, cool, could have been, it's all good, done. Exactly.

But it's also there's the conversation around that. There's the, there's a whole cultural phenomenon based on this trailer, this moment, what happened, right? And I just, I wonder what do you guys come down on this in terms of like, where people like trailers and spoilers and trailers. Second period, end of it. One of my favorite things, again, high five for the death of theaters and we're gonna go all the way and on digital day and data is the fact of now where it's like, I go through what I love doing is going through the Amazon thing I've talked about. I watched a lot of bad trailers, but if a movie sounds interesting, read it to Jen. You want to watch this? We jump in and you don't know.

She's chained to a bed.\" And like, but that's all I knew. It like, all right, I started and I was like, \"Oh, it's that girl from Entourage.\" I know she's been in a million things, but I think of her from Entourage. Yeah. \"Oh, it's the guy who was a Captain Pike.\" Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Fuck. I like, I like these people. And I would have been more inclined if I saw the box, I'd been like even more excited.

And I was like, \"All right, that sounds cool.\" And I went there and the movie started. I was like, \"Oh, this is not in English.

And then it movie ended and we're all like, then we fuck sucked. That's funny. I didn't see a trailer for that movie and I agree with what you're saying, yeah, to an extent because trailers I think are important on selling people on movies, period. We understand all that stuff. But everything you're talking about, you're not talking about the superhero movies, you're not talking about the Star Wars and these blockbusters.

And it's the reason I watched it. And next time there's another movie like that where everyone's like, hold, like there's a lot of buzz around there, like positive buzz, we're gonna go watch it because that's the culture that we're again, right?

You don't need them to be that long and you don't need 13 trailers from movie that comes out at a month. Like there's TV spots now, there's 30-second spots, there's 15-second spots, there's all these things. And you're talking like for a video game, it's okay because there's like a 60 hour experience that no matter what your get might be different for you than me because we're playing it differently, right? Depending on the game. For a movie, you only have two hours really to pull from. So if you're showing 10 to 15 minutes of it, that's a pretty sizable to spread out.

What I think, hey, and I don't know that this is even feasible in Hollywood's current structure, but and it wasn't even intended at the time, but the original Spider-Man movie, if you guys remember the trailer where, fuck, yes, okay, the first trailer for that to enjoy. So yeah, it was a bank robbery stopped and then he webbed up the helicopter right between the Twin Towers and they ended up pulling that because I don't haven't happened.

Blade Runner, there's nothing in there. Blade Runner just did it with the shorts instead of having theatrical trailer. Thank you. Yeah, they they went and they made stuff. Did you see the shorts going in? But I did. I haven't seen Blade Runner yet, but I, but the problem with that is is those are all like 6 minutes apiece. I can't really make it a trailer. So if trailers, I think like, let's take Star or Star Wars, right? We're now granted, and I don't remember it well, but I remember Force Awakens, right?

Batman V Superman, I got the plot main plot points right. But I gave Zack Snyder way too much credit where I'm like, and this is gonna be the Joker and this is gonna be that thing. I'm on the job. Yeah, but overall, I got where we're going. Hmm. I digress. Maybe I'm wrong and you guys watched Force Awakens. It felt like that gave it away.

But for you, I mean, more delicate now, the Force Awakens. Yes, like I saw everybody last night, maybe it was IGN people. It was some dweebs liking Anthony Carboni, but not Anthony Carboni, the dweeb saying like, \"Oh man, don't watch this. It's really spoiler.\" And I watched it and then it was people arguing amongst themselves just like, he's it, that's morally because it feels like they're just cutting dialogue out of context. I'm like, that's what a trailer spoilers. I watched it and Jenn was like, \"I don't know what's happening.\" I'm like, \"Well, that's a good thing.\" And I was like, \"But what don't you exactly understand?\" Like I thought I was like, \"I don't understand it where Maz Kanata, I guess that's where big word, he's still\"",

And it's like, everything is a spoiler if there's context to it. And everything what they're wearing. Well, yeah, but the do the trailer is in and of itself, which is that you're sacrificing a little bit of spoiler so that can get people hype for your movie. That's what trailer. It's always been that way. And and they've just been putting more and more into whether the question becomes like, how much is too much? And that boils down to an individual level. I purposely stopped watching trailers for Blade Runner for the first one. I was like, \"I'll watch the\"",

I want to go into this. I'm already hyped for it.\" In fact, I probably should've watched the first one, but I'm glad it's gotten even more hype for it. With Force Awakens, they needed to have a trailer and it needed to be that trailer, the one that came out with the Chewie, \"We're home\" line because it person, we're coming, we're back. This is okay. You, it's in good hand. I still feel like a mean of bringing Blade Runner into the Star Wars conversations is the biggest fuck Apple in the world versus an orange. Yeah, yeah.

Could've been the same thing here where it's just like the fuck logo rolls things up and then it was just like, like, you know, Kylo Ren's fuck lightsaber starting. And I don't know over there, the fuck that fortitude, the restraint Disney has shown with Episode VIII has been very impressive to me because we are two months away from this movie releasing.

I did the same thing you did with Suicide Squad, which is piece together the whole thing. And it was so easy with the amount of footage they put out to be like, all this shit's going down to the extent of Han Solo's get a fuck die because you can see the jagan. Again, I'm I'm doing the screen by screen breakdown. Yeah, you with the amount of fuck out right now for The Last Jedi, you can't do that. People don't know what's happening. The Last Jedi. Yeah. And I kind of think spoiler changes from person to person. So like with this, you know, you may see something in there and you're just like, \"Oh, that's a perfect trailer.\" But somebody else sees it and they're like, \"Oh, this person's in it or that person's not in the trailer, so maybe they're not\"",

Or like for Ragnarok, hell yeah, I'm out. Hey, the trailers make that movie look awesome. But somebody could look at that and go, \"Wait, they can tell Hulk's in that.\" Spoilers. Yeah, yeah. Again, the point is, I put at the same time, it's been a talked about thing where that was a consequence. So I, unless you're completely out of the know about everything that should, I do wish to an extent, and I'm not gonna just do the whole hang on my socks at my job. So grand, I get to talk about the fuck all the time. Even if I was a general consumer working in the newspaper again, I'd wish to be able to go, \"I'm true blackout.\" But I feel like, yeah, I like, I'm gonna run into the fact that Hulk's in Thor or something to that extent.

And it was a fuck awesome concept, but the twist was in the trailer. And it would have been such was great. The twist was the trailer starts with a bunch of people stuck on this island, right? Sure.

But you've already blown the greatest reaction of all time from Kristine in the fact that when she watched Batman Begins and the Waynes get shot, she's gasped and she goes, \"The parents die?\" And you're like, \"How the fuck do you not know Batman story?\" What's funny though, is it'll be like, \"You know that Spider-Man got like Peter Parker got bit by.\" Suppose we do. \"Of course I fuck know that.\" I'm like, \"No, why'd you sit down and record their reaction? Be like, who is Luke Skywalker's father?\" I just see if she knows that. She knows that. But what I'm saying is like, once you get into this sci-fi stuff, that's just not something she grew up with.

Yeah, it boils down to you. If you don't want you to spoil, it's just, it's not, it's really not that hard to not have something spoiled for you, right? It's here on the Internet. You're getting spoiled. No, I mean, if your trailers losing, right? Like there's like, like animated GIFs out the ass. You're gonna see it. Your fuck man. You can't be in a Facebook group.

I mean, that's again, we've talked about this thought. Well, we need that we need to decide. I don't know if we ever did. We need to have an official decision of how long you have to wait before you get to spoil ****. It's okay to spoil **** from Game of Thrones, but I mean, we know like with that, when's it gonna be okay to openly talk about spoilers from the Star Wars trailer that just came out? I mean, look, if you're talking about it, it's second the trailer comes out, 'cause at that point the information's out there. It's like your **** bad right now.

You know what I'm talking about? Like, they need you like you spoil these **** movies for people, right? I mean, put it in context. Imagine if The Empire Strikes Back trailer showed that \"I am your father\" is like the very end. It's like a Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, \"I am your father\" and sons. Like, \"Oh wow, that's cool. Okay, I guess that's out there.\" Like, that's what kind of what we're getting these days. So it's like, pull back a little bit. Doomsday shouldn't have been in the **** movie. Yeah, there's also an intense iteration of people as well though when it comes to spoilers because if I say I haven't seen a movie like I haven't seen Blade Runner, and you guys haven't gone, \"Oh well, this happens, this happens,\" and if it's a slightly",

If I said that happened, maybe go, \"I have not seen this movie.\" I would not, but that's a dick thing to do to spoil if the person... Now, I did that to you today when I asked your questions. It was a documentary, yeah, and drank my entire so do I listen to you? I enjoyed it. I feel like it's a girl's game on Netflix. Does that only chance you are gonna watch Blade Runner, right? But when it comes to a lot of these other movies, like, you're not like me, spoiler, Greg, he's not gonna **** watch it. Yeah, it would be okay if you've seen The Matrix, right? You're a monster.
