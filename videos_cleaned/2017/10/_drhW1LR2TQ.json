I've built a reputation on YouTube as The Completionist for my man versus game review show. Every week I complete a game. That's my shtick. I've been doing it for six years. I've completed over 30 plus games included. You don't just mean beats. No, I do everything. All the achievements, all the trophies, unlockable secrets, every mode, a guy. No, no rock unturned.

We air at noon. And yeah, it's just so one of the many things that I do. I have a Let's Play show. I have a boy band called Big Bad Bosses down in there. Yeah, there's a bunch of weird stuff out there. But I think at the end of the day, I love creating. And that's kind of I when someone says, what do I do? I kind of say, I create things. And that's that's kind of always been my motto is that I'm a creator. That's why people are like, you're you're a games critic. And I go, that that's one way of seeing it.

Like it is like a strategy guide almost, but condensed through the fun parts. Yeah, I I view it as doing my homework and showing proof. Yeah, like if I'm gonna give this, if I'm going to give a game a score or review kind of tile, I get to say, I this is my view and opinion and validation because I went the extra mile and got all the achievements or I beat the game nine times in a row or whatever it is. And that I think that's what makes me different everywhere else. Oh, I got I go crazy several times a week. I just don't let anyone show it.

Yeah, yeah, I mean, and it blows my mind cause like when you complete that game, you didn't just beat it. You didn't just 100% it. You had to presented every save file. Yeah, I did every every possible run. Sonic, single Sonic and Tails, Knuckles, Tails, Knuckles & Knuckles mode, all the Blue Spheres, all the Chaos Emeralds in every game save.

That is crazy. Um, you also have a Patreon, Patreon.com/ThatOneVideoGamer. Yeah, we can support them there as well. Recently relaunched. We have a show called Defend It where it's based off of Phoenix Wright. And it's me debating someone who looks as a person to sue named the Internet.

And we're very lucky to kind of like, you know, enjoy this kind of fun medium that we're in. Yeah, you bring up an interesting point with Final Fantasy XIII and just being like, Final Fantasy XIII sucks. It's like such a gut reaction people can say. Mm-hmm. But I mean, even for me, there's things about the game that I do like and there's things I don't like. And it's so much more constructive to break down.

Yeah, or what you watched someone's YouTube video on it and you're like, that's my opinion now because I identify with that opinion as opposed to, well, that's a good opinion to have, but I think X, Y, and Z. Yeah, and I think like that's a big component of the echo-chamber of the Internet is like, you can you're I'm always stoked to talk to you all about their opinions on games as long as it gets their actual opinion and not just something they read off of Reddit or or a top 10 list from GameSpot or IGN.

And the two of them really like kind of nurtured me and protected me throughout my my young adult years. And so uh, nothing scarier than Matt's copy of things to do and not to do, right? Absolutely. Yeah. And so it was funny when you guys started when you guys announced Kinda Funny. I didn't realize that Nick and Matt were brothers. I had no idea.

Have you been playing Golf Story at all? I just downloaded it. Oh, I haven't I haven't had the time. So we talked about it a bit last week. But I did play a little bit more after Kevin's wedding. That was like the main went as soon as we left the wedding. I was like, I want to go home. I was staying at my girlfriend's place. It was like, I don't play Golf Story. She's out of town. She's on vacation. I don't play this row, dude. We're **** living it up. No girls, no rules, the freakin weekend. Boom. About to have me some fun. Yeah, so we just popped in that",

I I will say that I've gotten to a point where the story gets really kooky and weird. And I'm loving it. But the dialogue is still so on point. Like it's so funny. And it hasn't lost any of the charm that it had for me. Like when I started playing the game. And I was like, we'll see how long this can last. And I'd say I'm about maybe 10 hours in. Maybe it's something like that. And I loving it so far. Haven't played it since that night though, since that day. And then last night I started up Hob. And Hob was announced in 2015.

And so it is essentially a top-down, very similar to A Link to the Past where you except it's a little bit more skill-based in terms of like defeating enemies and dodging them and dodge rolling away from people vessels. I came now. There is no there's no dialogue so far, which is really cool. And in that vein, arrives me a lot of Hyper Light Drifter where yeah, you're just how Hyper Light Drifter communicated in only photos and or like drawings and **** like that. This is essentially just it reminds me of how good animation is made where there's no dialogue, but it's it's the mark of a good animation where you can still get across like what's happening.

I was just like basically playing it because I was waiting for a render to go through last night. And I can't wait to dig into it maybe more tonight. You put it on PS4. PS4. Yeah, play on PS4. Along with and I've also been playing a has still been playing 2K18. The story mode still silly and not great. And holy **** during every cutscene, my PS4 Pro sounds like a goddamn jet engine.

You know, with all the the of course, as soon as I got hired here, I got a lot of friend requests from the Best Friends. And that's awesome.

But at least the beginning, the beginning stages and and kind of your atmosphere going into it feel very reminiscent of of Mario Sunshine more or less than than 64. Interesting. Yeah. And so it right now, I think it's available on everything except for Switch. I think yes. Well, I think I'll launch it's only available on Steam. But it's coming to Xbox One, PS4 by the end of this year. Interesting. So hot by the end of the holiday. We either in the holiday or early 2018, we should be seeing it on on on PS4 and Xbox One. See, my thing is, I I mean, I love it. And more platformers always a good thing to me. But we got Odyssey in a couple weeks. It's like, I know that like, I need another 3D platformer right now.

Now it's it's kind of that, you know, middle tier. You know, it comes out and like you hear about it, but it's like no one really played it or talked about it. And once people start playing it, it's like, no, you got it. You got to play it. Reminds me of Spec Ops: The Line a lot where, yeah, yeah, the people that play it are like, swear by it. Like, you've got to do this. Or Vanquish. Yes, I love Vanquish. It was just so fun. So damn good. Yeah.

And online the game was too new to really see what website had it correct. And some of the Korok seeds especially towards the end game in Ganon's Castle, you can't tell where they are because of that 3D top-down forced camera thing when you get into those no huh into the dungeon areas.

The Landmaster stuff doesn't ever feel quite right. The Arwing missions are perfect. Yeah. And the story in that game is so fun and it's what I love about Star Fox 64.

When you look at it, my biggest problem with the game is that the motion controls but my biggest thing that I am upset about is the fact that it's this joy.

No. So this is this is how I learned to play Star Fox Zero and this is what opened up my mind a lot to really like me because at first admittedly I put in about 60 hours in a Star Fox Zero.

It's like let's make it weird let's make it fun absolutely yeah but I think that the level design in New Super Mario Bros. U is Fanta oh I agree I agree with you tis like I sent up for that game I agree with what you're saying though and again I've said this so many times but the Wii U's library is fantastic because we got so many new IPs isn't the right word the con is it's new IPs within the Nintendo IP war yeah Captain Toad oh so **** Splatoon which is is just a brand new light Yoshi's Woolly World and Yoshi's Woolly World we got Mario 3D World which I **** love that that to me is like I don't want to say",
