He didn't even see the first one and cool bro really a guy that's kind of an impressive feat yeah the movie well I feel like because I gave him such a really spot-on synopsis I'm sure he really got you to pick you understand the nuances of the relationship between Deckard and Rachael Rachael you know are we not gonna go into spoilers?

I still got out that the newer generation of Replicants were still, there was still a lot of bias against them, but they just, they just accepted it. And that's, that's me, was the core of what this whole thing was about. It backs up that same theme of like, yes, they're still able to go wherever they want, but in reality, they're still slaves to the human race, right? The masters are still the humans and they are still there. They're quote-unquote trying to be more human than human, but they're not yet. And then when we get to the third act and we see there is a band of them that's like, \"This is messed up. We're putting our men together and we're fighting against this.\" That's when I think K has that, that moment where he's like, \"I have to now go either like,\" you know, he has that kind of crisis where he's like, \"Am I gonna go save Deckard?

I loved that it felt like a season of television and I loved it. And at the end of the day, the filmmakers respected us as an audience entirely and were like, you know what, we're gonna be deep, we're gonna have stuff, but we're also gonna explain things to you. There's not going to be some messed up plot holes and all that stuff, but they're gonna take their time with every scene and let it flow. I feel like the first two-thirds of the movie they did an amazing job of hitting every single thing and doing it right. The third, I didn't want to call it the third act because that's not fair.

Like they, they had everything was so smart and perfect up until that point, and then it's all Harrison Ford's game. Yeah, and then it started being like, hey, there's gonna be some, we're just gonna kind of take a couple leaps of faith, right? One of which was when you start thinking about it, you're like, how did they have this piece of technology that they have? He has, carries with him in his pocket that he talks to the entire time that's made by the bad guys and the bad guys never once used that to spy on him, right?

Why can't, I don't understand why they, that was just a little weird for me where I'm like, I thought that was gonna be a plot device where at the end the, the AI had betrayed him and was like, \"Oh, because,\" you know, there was the line, \"Whatever you want, whatever you want to hear,\" or whatever it is. Yeah, like they were, she was fake the entire time. She was just telling him what he wants to hear. He realizes that and that's why like, you know, they tried to tug at your heartstrings when she dies, but it didn't really have, \"Oh, they didn't know?\" I love that so much when her last words were, \"I love you.\" I loved it because that is the generic cliche, this is what",

But because she was an AI and I already had this connection with their relationship and it was, it being fake, that it was beautiful to me because it didn't come off as corny because that's the point, right? Like her saying, \"I love you,\" is like she was programmed to tell us all that, right? Oh, good. So messed up and meta. But so that, that was one thing where I'm like, okay, I'm a little confused about that, but I can, I can leave that off. When he goes, \"Hey, I have everything I need off-world to get this out of you.\" I'm like, \"Ah, yeah, why did you do that? What does that mean? Why, what, what do you have off?

Again, the movie was already really long by that point and that's pretty much towards, that's pretty much in the last 10-15 minutes, whatever. Yeah, great scene, though. Yeah, how so intense. And I thought, I called so harsh, anyone who knows how to build tension better than any filmmaker, Villeneuve is the best at that. But after that, after we resolved that little bit, I was like, \"Oh, he's gonna go after Wallace.\" No, he's going to, he was going to.

One of my favorite things about this movie is that I went into it and the trailers didn't spoil things for me. And in addition to that, the movie didn't spoil things for me as we're going through. Pretty, they lead you on and they tell you, hey, Ryan Gosling is Deckard's son, like showing the horse and all stuff. As they go, the moment you see all the, the same architecture he saw in his vision, you're like, \"Oh, it's him.\" Yeah, and then when it's revealed that it's not, I was like, \"Oh, thank you, thank you for not doing that.\" What did the movie doesn't end in a giant war with Replicants, his army of",

I was like, \"Great, this is a different type of movie,\" you know? And I think it ended really, really beautifully with, with Deckard talking to, meeting his daughter for the last time, wherever. But I still felt like it wasn't the ending that I wanted. I still, no, it wasn't entirely fulfilling. But at the end, that was the point, right? The point was that like, if Ryan Gosling had this happy-go-lucky, I think at the end, out of like, that's a little contrary to what we, well, we've been like, what we expect here. That was why that character was so unique and deep was that he was just this conflicted, messed up, like anomaly in the world, right? Shouldn't exist.

There's the moment of realization that he might be something better than what he is and he was like, and then there's the moment of realization that he's just, I love it. In the movie, there's the line where's like, \"Oh, you never smile.\" And he never smiles. There's no single moment he smiles until the end when he sees Deckard talk to his daughter. One smile from, right? Well, I love the juxtaposition at the end where he's feeling the snow, he's fake, and then it cuts to the real girl and she's like, yeah, he's like, yeah.

Of course not. I don't understand why he had the memory. I don't get why he put it in him. She put it in. He could have been anyone. Why? He could have been anyone. She just, she's in there making memories, right? And like she had that memory and she said it was illegal, but like, I'm not sure that's, yeah, that's another one of the things in the story that I'm like, oh, I hate when they do that or it's like, that's too big of a coincidence. She just happened to put the memory in the one guy that was gonna come to hunt her down. That's what that was going to hunt her. He only, what?

So my question, you guys, is the big question going in, is Deckard a Replicant? Yes, I think he's 100%. The only reason why I don't think he is because they talked about that in the year 2020 is when they started to create the Nexus-8 models. Mhm.

Cause if he was human and humans are able to breed with Replicants, which is what Tyrell Corporation would have wanted probably, then that means that it would have bred a whole new being of like half Replicant, half human. And that would have been like the next evolution. And that's what I thought this story was gonna be about. And that's my one, my another critique I have of the overarching like bad guy plot was that I thought Jared Leto's whole point was gonna be, I like, he was gonna be a good guy at the end going like, \"I want the baby because I want to foster like human life is done.

That was kind of a bummer for me. The last thing I want to say that when my favorite scenes are little cues was the bring back of the piano from the first movie where him and Rachael had that bed song that they played and the piano's cue was the first note of that song.

Fast & Furious franchise star Tyrese Gibson blames Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson for the ninth movie's delay. Originally slated for a 2019 release, Fast 9 was officially pushed to 2020. Something Gibson isn't happy about.
