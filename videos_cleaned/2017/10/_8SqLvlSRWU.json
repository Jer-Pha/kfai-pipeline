Thanks for, oh my god, I'm so happy this is finally happening. Me too. You've never been on Kinda Funny. Kind never even big official E3. You got kind of my live E3. You're in that. Yeah, obviously, who could forget? Was it two as well? And yes, it's the first one. Yeah, yeah. But E3, you were in three day. Oh yeah, you were part of the show. I was. You were feeling the perfect. Yeah, it's fantastic, some would say. But I'm very happy to have you here. Greg Miller will return tomorrow, but for today, we're like, I was like, \"Alright, the Nintendo World Championships are gonna happen this weekend. If any news were to come from it, not that anything really did, I want Fran Mirabella here by my side to tell them to school Nintendo.\" Hell yeah, man. You say, \"Haven't you made the Nintendo team?\" Oh, thank you. Yeah, I was part of it. Anyway, it was the review scores that was so",

Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Kinda Funny, no, it's Kinda Funny Games Daily. Each and every weekday we get together right here on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames to talk about video games and news and all the stuff coming out that you need to know about. You can get it on Twitch, like I just mentioned, live, or you get it on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames when it goes up as a VOD, or you can get it on iTunes or podcast services around the globe. I'm a little rusty. It was a hard, it was a hard night last night. Ah, Fran hurt me. I'm not gonna tell him all bad though. They are, they already know. I was out with Nick.

What, take a guess, Tim. What do you think I've been playing? Destiny 2, a lot of it. But some of you may not know, but I'm Mr. Destiny at IGN, along with Destin, CJ Gibson, Sean Finnegan on our Fireteam Chat show. I saw your new banner that you guys put up. Yeah, well, you guys look like a broke-ass, it's like a sad gamer boy banders. Yeah, like that. But man, I've been playing a ton of Destiny 2. I did check out very briefly the Battlefront II beta. Hmm, not that much time. GT Sport has a demo right now. But other than that, I'm grinding like Destiny is all about grinding. So I'm spending a lot of time in it, and I can't wait to play Super Mario Odyssey. Oh my god, yes. So, um, you, you stream a lot.",

Of course, man. Of course, of course. I've been playing still Cuphead, lots of it. I am in love with that game, Fran. It is, it is so good. Have you spent any time with it? Uh, it's on my list. You know, I got to get my Hunter started and then go back to real life. Of course. Um, but let me ask you, like, have you always liked shooters like that, or is it something about Cuphead? Oh, well, Cuphead's definitely something about Cuphead. And that game is beautiful and everything about it.

But yeah, it, I keep saying this, it might be the most rewarding video game I've ever played. Wow. And I'm, I'm getting there, man. I'm slogging through it. I, I'm at these penultimate two-boss. Nice. Yeah. Do you play co-op at all? No, I have just been playing solo. That's hardcore. That's the way to do it. Is I think if you play co-op, you get a few perks, make things a little bit easier, but it's still brutal.

So it's now time for what is and forever will be the Rovers Report. It's time for some news, ladies and gentlemen. Today we have four stories, a baker's dozen. Thank you, cool Greg. The first story comes from IGN. Jonathon Dornbush reports, \"The Nintendo World Championships winner, Thomas Ganda, took home the top spot in the Nintendo World Championships 2017, defeating returning champ John Numbers in a fierce, long competition representing Nintendo's growing presence in the competitive gaming space. The third Nintendo World Championship, following the footsteps of 2015's and the original back in 1990, challenged players",

Quote, \"We were really, we really want to focus in on games that make sense. The competition rules make sense. There's a clear objective,\" Bill Trinen explained. \"It's easy for a fan to understand what people have to do. It's easy for the player to understand what they have to do, but still a game that's fun to play and one that's fun to watch.\" Honing in on those specific challenges like a Breath of the Wild shield surfing race, a Tetris high score run, or Mario Party 2 minigame gauntlet came from rounds of internal testing by the Nintendo Treehouse",

And sometimes you think you have a good idea and it's not.\" Trinen says, \"If we look at the spectrum, esports is really on one extreme, and on the very other side of the spectrum, you've got what we call competitive fun. I still classify us in this competitive fun range because we do want to make sure our content is accessible with hardware, and I think we've really done that with a Switch.\" Doug Bowser says, the VP of Nintendo, whose actual name is Doug Bowser. Yeah, I still don't believe it. It's really, really weird. We've got great content on the device, more to come obviously since we're in the early stages. The event also lasted more than an hour",

Did you get to watch any of it? Yeah, I did. I watched mostly towards the end when things were heating up between Numbers and Thomas Ganda. Before I mention that, I really like, shout out to Bill Trinen, my boy. I've known that boy a long time. But you try to make it sound hard that in the Treehouse, man, we were, we're playing the games like really nice with all the games or apartments.

I wouldn't make out alive between the two of them, just sh*t talk still roast fest about. It's just, it's all, I love, I love those guys. But yeah, Bill Trinen, I've known for a long time, super talented, originally translator for Miyamoto. You're in ton of his interviews, but now he's just part of those 100 dudes. He's been there forever. So the Nintendo World Championships, yes. So I don't, you know, follow them religiously, but I did watch a little bit of 2015 and then now 2017.

But man, I'm just like so excited for the game and see these guys have to go into the game. They've never played those levels, have not played, I assume that much Super Mario Odyssey, maybe. All right, depending on if they've made it to any events. And yet having to go in blind and seeing what actually the, the match before Numbers, uh-huh, really, he like crushed the level. He was just doing all the right stuff. It was almost as if he'd played it before, but it was just blind. He's just going in. I was like, \"This guy's a wizard.\" He won the 2015 Championship though.

Yeah, that's how it goes, you know, adapting in real time to like, I've never played with this before in the pressure. I've played under those circumstances before. You know, I think we all have. Were them? Yeah, you are at the Super Smash Bros. tournament they did. That's right. At E3, I went up before Smash Bros. were you was out. Yeah, basically they had a Super Smash Bros. tournament at E3 several years ago. Me, wait, four years ago. It was the year to do it. I'm pretty sure it was the year before the last internal World Championship. Yeah, but what they had was sort of a media selection and it wasn't really like an in earnest competition. It was like a quick play around. Man, I still would have had that, I swear. But they like, they randomized your characters. Yeah, and that was lame, man. Like, why didn't",

So I watched the entire thing and I thought I was gonna be like an hour-long show, and it ended up being like almost four and a half hours. And I watched from beginning to end, and I was shocked at the production quality and the level at which they took this seriously and tried to make it a really entertaining product. Obviously, we look at this stuff from the video side as well as just the edit on the inside.

He was there the entire time and his commentary was on point. He did a great job leading the conversation and making it clear what the competitors were doing in every single game. And they had a rotating cast of color commentary with Audrey Drake, yeah, and with Bill Trinen and some other Treehouse people. And Andrea Rene hosted, and Andrea Rene hosted, obviously, she killed it. And it was as I was, \"Alright, this is great.\" But I was impressed by the, the games that they chose throughout it.

Um, and it was really cool how they started off with, with Breath of the Wild, which was kind of an obvious pick. Yeah, but the shield surfing was an interesting, yeah, like nuance to it. And then as they kept going through this, they're getting to the most obscure games. The Bird & Beans thing, it's like, what the f***? They did Mario Party 2. Yes, like, who would've saw that coming? I noticed they played Mario Party 2. Wow. And they played Super Mario Bros. Deluxe on the Game Boy Color, the competitive two-player mode on Game Boy Color. I think that's so cool though.

There's gonna be Arms, there's gonna be like, yeah, Splatoon, there's gonna be some Arms. But I thought they did a great job of having that, but then also having a level of surprise coming in there and a bunch of like Tetris on the Game Boy, which is like perfect. Right? Donkey Kong Country Returns on the Wii. Yeah, like it was very obscure and they did a good job of finding modes and things will be fun.

They didn't know what the only game they knew they were gonna do is Metroid: Samus Returns. Yeah. And that they'd, it was the, did you play that game? No, not yet. I have the Collector's Edition.

I was waiting for like a big reveal or like, I mean, what I was really hoping for was Super Smash Bros. being announced, a port on Switch, like the Deluxe, you know, whatever. Oh, sure. Yeah.

Like I wish that like last time at the 2015 World Championships, they did announce EarthBound Beginnings, which is not, yeah, whatever. But I mean, that's a big deal for fans. Yeah, you know. So there wasn't any announcements. So they announced Arms new DLC. But that's, that's okay. That's fine. You're just not an Arms guy. I know. I love all you love Arms. I love Arms.

If you had to pick two games that were not in it that you would have loved to see in the competition for competitive fun, what would those two games be? I mean, I don't know. They didn't have two that I can really, they did a really good job of having all the things that you did nothing wrong with. Mario had Mario Kart, Arms, Splatoon. They're all the big games. Smash.

And then the other one that occurred to me, maybe it was something like Sin and Punishment. Hmmmm. But that'd be like a nice fun little show. Like this is something totally random. I would love the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium mini-games. Oh, you ever play those? Cause those, those were like a multiplayer classic. Oh my god. So what about the best pictures from Pok\u00e9mon Snap? Whoa.

God Eater 3 gets its first trailer. Yeah, the sci-fi action JRPG where tiny anime fighters slice up giant monsters is coming back for a third game. Bandai Namco released a teaser trailer for the game earlier today that shows God Eater 3's likely hero breaking free of some futuristic handcuffs in order to go pummel some Aragami, the series' main antagonist. The press release describes the game as, quote, \"Team up with your other God Eaters to take down monsters, new Aragami that are tearing apart\"",

Their sales trajectories are down for their big heavy-hitting exclusives. Yeah, I think that that's part of it. I also just think in the world of racing sims, like to your point, that's where like if you look at Gran Turismo, like that is for major gearheads.

And but yeah, just once you get to seven, in addition to the spin-off games being right, I think for, mmm-hmm. But I was gonna say like when you contrast it with Horizon, like that's the conversation. It's like, oh, you know, what do we just want to like go to the forest all of a sudden and go do that, or do you want the gearhead stuff?

That happens. Obviously, there was a lot of commotion about the microtransaction stuff from Forza last week. And then Turn 10 came and was like, oh, we're gonna fix it this way, this way. A lot of people are theorizing that like, oh, the sales hit is due to that. I don't think so. I think the general public isn't aware of those type of things and they're still gonna buy the game.

I think it was between 5 and 6 was a bigger wait. And so that's more, actually it wasn't 5 on Xbox. I don't know, KindaFunny.com, stuff, you're wrong. But the point is, time gap can also affect sales. So when you're comparing like those Delta differences and units sold like that, there's a lot to that story.

Long, I took the time code. Yeah, all right. Star Wars Battlefront II is a loot crate problem. Instead of a progression system, the only way to get new abilities and weapons in Battlefront II is from opening loot crates bought either with in-game currency or real-world currency, price to be determined. Either you randomly receive the ability or weapon directly from the loot crate, or you randomly receive an amount of scrap to go towards eventually creating, crafting, crafting it. Although scrap costs are high and amount to",

Although scrap costs are high and amount to receive torturously low. Star Card abilities in Battlefront II change not only how regular Assault, Heavy, Officer, and Specialist soldier classes play, as well as Interceptor, Bomber, and Fighter spaceship classes. They also change how Battle Point unlocked power-up players, playing characters play, all the way up to the iconic heroes and villains of Star Wars lore. Your options are getting lucky when opening a combination of daily loot crates, gifted loot crates, and earning loot crates for leveling up, or when opening loot crates bought with in-game currency. But as, sorry, this is typo, but as in-game currency is awarded at a flat rate for a team regardless of performance, this could take a long time. It gets worse when you consider there are Bronze, Silver, and Gold versions of each Star Card, plus a fourth",

For instance, Boba Fett has a Star Card ability called Death From Above, which grants him damage reduction while jetpacking, jetpacking, and using Rocket Barrage. Its lowest tier damage reduction, Bronze, is 50%, and its highest tier, 100%. That's a huge difference. So not only are you now after the full collection of Star Cards, you have to the best versions of them. And again, you can individually upgrade them by spending scrap, but you were given too little and too randomly to make this reliably viable. Wouldn't it be easier if you had a big pile of money to spend on a stack of loot crates instead? Yes. In other words, Battlefront II, a full price game, is pay to win.

Arguably as well, like you can just get some of the stuff in the game, but it takes forever. Mm-hmm. So the incentive seems to be to pay.

Um, this comes from Xavier Bone. Hey Tim and Fran, or Bone, I guess the problem is, hey, it's have been friend. As we get closer to 2018, The Game Awards are getting closer. My question is, what is your Game of the Year so far? And is there any game coming up that might be a contender for your Game of the Year? Super Mario Odyssey seems the one that might be a contender. And Zelda for me was already way up there. Outside of that, I gotta catch up and play more. Yeah, right.",

But Zelda, PUBG is up there for me despite it being early access. Yeah, that's an interesting. It is. But whatever. Well, if it comes out on Xbox One X and Xbox and all that, that would be a full release. Well, but still, it's still early access. It'd be in the Xbox Game Preview. Is it? I thought it was supposed to be like a full rundown. That's weird for you to hear, by the way. But um, it could happen. Yeah. And then what are the other top adds up there for me? Man, it's I love that game so damn much. And in my personal Game of the Year discussion, when I talked to him, Sonic Mania, I gotta give a shout-out to. Oh man, it's like, let's be real, that's not the Game of the Year. You know, Horizon's up there as well. Yeah, but",
