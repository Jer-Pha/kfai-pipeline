I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside making his return to the show, the Pier One, Tim Gettys. Let's him post. Oh man, Greg, it feels good to be back here. Tom, all video games. I'm going to want to do this for at least a week, a true man's week, as they call it. I've been on NeoGAF every day, uh-huh, and it just feels lonely reading all these things, not having anyone to talk about video games with. Happened now you were over in that Hawaii. I was. Were you playing games? I was, yeah. What else? You talk too much about what I was playing, really. I can say, yeah, that I was playing Metroid: Samus Returns. Hell yeah, you can. I can say that I like it very much. Okay, that is all I can say. Okay, okay, we'll talk more. I some of the Gamescast about that. Yeah, I don't know about all the dates and stuff, but I think it works. It works. Yeah, if not, **** them. Wasn't Nintendo going to do? Well, they've never come after anybody, you know, no.",

For now, let's begin the show with what is and forever will be the Roper Report. Five items on the report. Number one, a doozy. You might have heard of this one. I'm going to read the BBC article about PewDiePie dropping the N-word during a live stream. I inhaled a Clif Bar right before I came on, and then moats are at the back of my throat, kicking. Mmm. The world's highest-paid YouTube star, PewDiePie, has used the N-word during an online broadcast. The 27-year-old Swede, real name Felix Kjellberg. Well, he was calling PewDiePie for me, right?

After using the term, he appeared to recognize his error, saying, \"I don't mean that in a bad way.\" PewDiePie, who has more than 57 million subscribers, previously had to defend himself over anti-Semitism allegations. On another occasion, he was suspended from Twitter for his so-called, for so-called Islamic State jokes. Sean Vanaman, whose Campo Santo studio develops the game Firewatch, tweeted that he intends to file a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) reports in an attempt to remove all videos and streams of PewDiePie playing his company's title.

I'm sick of this child getting more and more chances to make money off what we do, what we make. He's worse than a closeted racist. He's a propagator of despicable garbage that does real damage to the culture around this industry. I'd urge all of the other developers, and we'll be reaching out to folks much larger than us, to cut him off from the content that has made him a millionaire. Furthermore, we're complicit. I'm sure that we've made money off the 5.7 million use that video has, and that's something for us to think about.

In February, some of his videos were found to contain Nazi references or anti-Semitic imagery, which resulted in Disney cutting ties with him. In February, Disney said that while PewDiePie has had a reputation for being provocative and irreverent, some of his videos were made, he made, were inappropriate. In one of the controversial videos, PewDiePie paid two people through a crowdsourcing website to hold up a sign which read, \"Death to all Jews.\" PewDiePie has accepted the material was offensive and said he doesn't support, quote, \"any kind of hateful attitudes.\" He said that the anti-Semitism claims were insane and unfair, adding, \"I am sorry for the words I used as I know they would offend people.\" This route led to YouTube canceling the release of PewDiePie's new series, Scare PewDiePie.",

And so far, at least when we were getting ready for Kinda Funny Games, the, I'm sorry, but the morning show, and then it is still no official comment from PewDiePie and I needed social media platforms. I'm not sure if that's happened. If it does pop during this, I'd ask you to go put it in a KindaFunny.com/You'reWrong. Um, before we even weigh in, I want to kick it over to Andre Rodian. The KindaFunny.com/KFGd, and says, \"Hey, Greg, I wanted to ask you what you think about the latest PewDiePie controversy. I'm a black, gay man that listens to many YouTubers like Kinda Funny.

I personally think PewDiePie is a white supremacist based on his actions. Some might say that's a bit too far, but to me, you don't have to wear a hood and burn crosses to be one. Just look at their actions. It's become too common lately, and I am disappointed that people who I watch feel like this is not a big deal. Just wondering where you are on all of this. That's all.

I was scrolling, and then I got to Vanaman's tweets, and I was like, \"What the **** is happening?\" And went back to Patrick Klepek from Waypoint, watched the video, the commentary there, and I was just like, \"What the ****?\" Like, I, I can't put into words how disgusting this is to have this happen. And the whole, yeah, you feel he's a white supremacist, stuff like that. I, that's your opinion. I want you to have it. I'm not defending PewDiePie at all.

There is that line of like, \"All right.\" Like, again, I'm not watching the content. I'm watching super clips of it in cuts of it, or like, \"Okay, what? I don't, maybe this is one way to interpret MoMA to get here.\" I, I don't, you can't, I can't, not knowing this man, not knowing this person outside of the occasional tweet, maybe we've shared. It's hard to look at all this and not side with Andre, not be like, \"There's something horrible under the cylinder, under the surface here.\" Well, the thing is, when it comes to this situation, what he did yesterday, yeah, he immediately recognized he **** up and did something wrong by saying, \"Oh, I didn't mean in the bad way.\"",

However, you can't say that you have a responsibility when you are public persona to the, to your viewers, to the audience, to your non-viewers and people that are not in your audience that are going to see this stuff, yeah, and have their opinions and whatever. Free speech, all that, sure, whatever. I would never be in a situation where that, those words would come out of my mouth when I'm playing a video game, yeah, and I'm saying, \"**** you,\" to someone. Yeah, exactly.

We do need to talk about this, and he needs to be held responsible for his actions and used as an example.\" I, because for him being at the top, you need to use the top as an example so that going all the way down, everyone else realizes this is wrong. There is a clear line. This isn't a personal politics thing. I keep seeing that get thrown around a lot, even from people we respect. You, the whole Boogie, Boogie, sweet.

No, this isn't a politics thing of like, \"I'm okay saying that.\" No, no, but hate speech for the sake of it being hate speech. The what Andre's talking about, the white supremacy thing, that gets really complicated. Those are all labels, and you can take all that away. At the end of the day, when you are using that word as an insult to somebody else, yeah, you are putting down a group of people and implying white supremacy, period. Like, there's no way around that.

Well, okay, I mean, I think with that, but that is what he meant though, the not a bad way, meaning not a racist way, even though it is inherently racist.

He's threatening a DMCA lawsuit and saying he's sick of Pewds profiting from other people's work. Personally, I think that's absolutely ridiculous. DMCA is a copyright law. He didn't violate any copyright law. Secondly, I'm sure Campo Santo was happily profiting off stream, was generating sales for them. But now, because someone uses a racial slur while not even playing their game, it's an issue. I'm calling BS. What are your thoughts on his comments and a possible lawsuit?\" It absolutely is a copyright issue because Campo Santo owns the copyright to the game. PewDiePie is not allowed to just stream the game. You know, it is a right that he is being given by Campo Santo. At any time, they can take away. So the premise of this question is is",

I still haven't been so many rumors, obviously, of like WB Montreal was working on a Superman game. No, then they moved over. They were working on a Suicide Squad. Well, no, now it's a Justice League game. And duh. And then, yeah, the Rocksteady thing is that there's been rumors of a Damian Wayne game going on and thought about. I think Rocksteady's working on another Batman game. I think that if there's a Bruce Wayne character in it, I would, I would **** die for a Batman Beyond game. Of course, just **** do that and pick it up in that world, but not call it an Arkham anything. Kevin Conroy is gonna be a part of it, but I think they've just cultured him on a way around this where you go, \"No, Arkham games are",

You feel like you actually accomplished something, but in reality, they're working on a **** Batman game over there. Batman is in their next game. I swear to God, I, it must be. I don't know. I've given up on a Justice League game, whatever. Just make more DC superhero games in general. Tim, it's time to Squad Up. Never roll alone.

Tim, yes, what do we get wrong? So there's a couple things here. It's an interesting, I want to bring it up to you guys. Sure. Griswold Diablo says, \"Greg, you're wrong. The website is legally binding.\" Leonard French, lawyer from channel Lawful Masses, went over this and it's over time out about Santo's site saying it. So I don't know. Some your lawyer that you're talking about, not your lawyer, but the lawyer TotalBiscuit tweeted about, \"I was not legally binding.\" This lawyer says it is legally",

I don't know that we're not here about the legality exactly, but it is interesting that on their site they do give people rights. I think it's just an empty threat at this point. Is it? It's just like I said, I think it was just an empty threat and it is very clearly, yeah, making your stance to make your business known. And why wouldn't he pull those down worth, you know, instead of getting more angry people mad at him? Us. Yeah. And then the, the next one, the only other thing was Ghazi saying, \"Not editorializing.

This goes exactly what I'm saying, where it is not a law, it is a defense, where it's not, we pick and choose. You pick and choose when you're getting sued. Mm-hmm. So that's what it comes down to. Okay. Is it, they would have to put that out there and be like, \"Here's why.\" I like that would be PewDiePie's defense. Sure. \"Here's how it's transformative.\" He's not gonna win that lawsuit.

And yeah, it could be applied for anything like parody and all that stuff. That's not, that's why you're gonna court, are your case in the court cases where fair use has been brought up, majority of the time it is in a way where it's news or education that it gets passed and okayed. The parody stuff gets **** lost all the time because people use this, but it doesn't hold up. And eventually, the, it is rules that it is not actually fair use. Gotcha. Complicated issues for us.
