I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the busiest lady in the business, Andrea Rene. Greg, I'm concerned about your health. What? Okay, go ahead, lay it on me. So we're sitting here getting ready to start the show and I noticed that you have blood in your own giant red spot on my eye. What? What's what's I feel like there's something great. Oh god, I look so bad. What happened? I played nine hours of Destiny without looking away from the TV yesterday. You didn't even go to the bathroom? The bathroom? I got a pizza, but I mean like the majority of it was literally staring at this for you. I loved it. It was great. Excellent. So what's your light level now? Our level 273 in power. That's fantastic. You I feel pretty proud about it. You know, you know, yeah, I stay what are you, 280 whatever the hell now? Not quite. I'm like 278, 279. Yeah, you know, it's a slow grind.

Everyone's been Andy and I have decided, if you were listening, you're clearly listening, watching this, we're gonna open the doors that are Kinda Funny clan. Well, no, there's a million Best Friend clans going on right now and the Reddit. Thank you so much for that. Take care of each other. We're gonna open that up today. I was trying to do it for this show, but every time I do it, Destiny's just like, now servers aren't, we can't communicate with the servers right now for clans.

We already have this clan established since we started. It was just me, Andy, and Luis Medina from Rooster Teeth, a very small clan. And that was the thing. Well, my idea was this, when so many of you rittany and started Kinda Funny Best Friend clans, shared your clans, that's great. My concern was I didn't want to ahead of Destiny to create this clan and then get into Destiny 2 and play it for four hours and look how it's fun and bounce. But Andy and I are committed to this. I am committed to it. Yes, you're committed. You of your own clan, of course, but we're all in it. We're in it to win it. I'm enjoying, want to continue to play this game.

It was I needed a selfish day, Andrea Rene. Of course, you're a hard-working man. Exactly. And we hadn't taken any days off in so long. And on Sunday, I was just a grumpy puss. I wasn't fun to be around. I felt bad. And Jen's like, you just need to take a day off. Like we're gonna go somebody, you take the day off and you play games to be happy. And I did.

I want to try to get in there and do it. Okay, we'll see. I just I'm telling everyone who's trying to raid and we have some of our clan members already lined up.

Skyrim on Switch is coming out November 17th, finally getting a release date on that. Two more Bethesda games. Now this is the one that blew everybody away. Two more Bethesda games are also coming out of the Switch. Doom and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. Doom arrives for the holidays while Wolfenstein II hits sometime in 2018. That was unexpected. It was. I actually got to see Doom on a Switch, but I can't talk about it until next week. Oh, see, I don't want to set you up about anything about it. Play Skyrim and that was not under embargo.

Oh, yes, there's a lot going on. There's a lot of information. Yeah, because especially when you're in combat, you're like in your menu constantly, at least I was when I was playing in Skyrim. So I don't know if it's going to be the cool mobile thing that I really wanted. Yeah, but of course, I would need to see what it looks like docked. But if I'm playing at dock, then why am I not playing it on my do you think it's for my Xbox? Do you think it's that you've been in me or we all have most of us been gone from Skyrim for so long?

But I guess I picking it up and playing it again, I was like, oh, I I actually don't actually don't want to play this again. Skyrim, I don't need to go back. But for people who maybe didn't play or for people who are like giant Elder Scrolls fans, yeah, looks good. Now I'm peppering in questions people are giving us as we go. Dorothy Rosa writes in and says, Greg and Andrea, this is such an unexpected and creative question. What's your take on Doom and Wolfenstein on Switch? Will they be downgraded or have Bethesda/Nintendo found a way to have triple-A current-gen on the Switch? Do you think this will have an impact on other developers' plans right now or only after launch/reception? Keep loving that chicken, do or take. So as I said, I can't talk about",

So as I said, I can't talk about Doom, but what I didn't know was that they were releasing Wolfenstein II. Yes, they didn't have that at this event that I was sure a game is coming to Xbox One, PC rights for this October. So I've played Wolfenstein a couple of times and previously when I've played it, it's looked fantastic. It's beautiful. It's played fantastic. I have to imagine that it's going to be downscaled a little bit on Switch versus its PS4 and Xbox One counterparts, not taking into consideration PC at all. Just comparing the consoles. I don't know why you would want to play Wolfenstein on Switch versus on another console, mostly because of the controller issue. And I know people will say, well, why don't you just and use the Pro Controller? It's like, okay, yeah, that works. But if you want to have the best experience playing",

But if you want to have the best experience playing Wolfenstein, like you should play it on a different console. Hmm, my argument would be, I think the people who travel a lot or are on the road or like, well, if you're gonna be hooked on Destiny and you want something triple-A on the go, right? That was always my thing with like, if Mass Effect: Andromeda had come to Switch, I feel like I would have probably beaten it because on a plane, I would be like, oh yeah, let's put some time into that. Way when I sit down at a PS4, it's a while. I won't play Destiny 2 right now or I want to play South Park when that comes around. Wolfenstein is that game that I'm excited for, but it's also that game that if you're asking me, I don't want to end up beating right away.

I hate when there's these staggered release dates. That sucks, you know, because it is the fact of like, oh, well, like, I mean, what did I miss it then? Is that's why it's coming out later? But I do like the idea that it's there. I do. But I don't think I'm gonna, you know, there's trophies behind. Yeah, this staggered release dates are probably just uh, they had to probably work with a third-party studio to, you know, port it or whatever. But I guess it gives people who are planning to skip it at launch time to play it later, right?

I think it speaks to some extent what we've been talking about with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox, Xbox One X and the whole argument of our console generation cycles going away like Xbox says they are. And if so, is this then do we have this base level for games that then can scale up to the Xbox One X and now apparently down to the Nintendo Switch? Is it is it that easy? Are we to this point that it won't be every game? But the thing, the fact that NBA 2K18 is the same game just to 30 frames per second. You assume Wolfenstein II is Wolfenstein II, but lower graphical fidelity, obviously, probably not as smooth. That's this is an interesting wrinkle in a time and in a place where I would have been like, well, you're not gonna see is third-party support for the Switch because it's just so hard to make things run there.

Gotcha. I do, but obviously disclose it on the air. Don't worry about it. Next week sometime, everybody stop asking. Let's get back to what everything that happened at the Nintendo thing. Kirby's new game on Switch is called Kirby Star Allies. And the 3DS Kirby Battle Royale release date was announced as January 19th, 2018. Nintendo announced a Pok\u00e9mon-themed New Nintendo 2DS XL. The red and white 2DS XL resembles a Pok\u00e9 Ball as much as non-spherical handhelds can't resemble a ball. At least the New Pok\u00e9mon New 2DS XL",

Demo for the game is available right now on in the eShop. Everybody freaked out. I saw everybody freaking out about this last night, yesterday during the day, and then people playing in the demo. I'm actually liking it a lot. I believe Joey downloaded it but did not play. That is correct. Correct your job, Joey. Mario Party is making a novel return by the way of Mario Party: The Top 100 for a Nintendo 3DS. I saw the GIF of Tim's face. It's one of the better ones.

Brittany writes in the KindaFunny.com/KFGDD and says, while I understand the magnitude of seeing huge games like Doom and Wolfenstein II coming to Switch (and couldn't be more excited for those that like those type of experiences), I can't help I walk away from the Direct so upset that the Mario Party compilation will not be on Switch.

It doesn't and that's the thing is I really don't have perspective. We can argue that there's an install base. Sure, there's a huge install base for 3DS. So you want people to buy that.
