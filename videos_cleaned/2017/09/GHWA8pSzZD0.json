Everybody on every host, Greg Miller, alongside, hi, I'm Anthony Carboni. So you do so much stuff, there's no easy way to introduce. Short Star Wars shows, not returns, yep, those are them. CarboniSexTape.com, mm-hmm, and that's, I run that, I own that, every revenue stream, that's how you make money. How excited for Destiny 2 are you? I got a couple hours in with my, with my beautiful boy last night. Yeah, was it nice to be reunited? It was nice to be reunited. If you, if you recall, when I was here on Monday, yeah, I had said that I was gonna, gonna roll me a new, roll me a new boy, and what'd you do? Did not. I saw my, saw my classic boy looking at me all happy, slightly upgraded shaders and polygons. How great is that intro where they go through, they show you like what you, here's the things you've accomplished, here's who you did it with, memories, yeah, ah, near-death experience, life",

Played all yesterday with Andy Cortez, then went home, played more. We're gonna play after this if you're watching live on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames or anymore. It's gonna be me, Anthe, and Andrea Rene from What's Good Games. Hey, sitting here with TV screens. Oh, playing together. How wonderful. In person fireteam. We're pretty stoked about it, baby.

Thank you very much. Anything. I was a good guy. My drama. Number one, if you haven't noticed yet, Destiny 2's Clans won't be live for a while. Bungie tweeted, quote, in game Destiny 2 clan features will be unavailable for the first several days after launch. Stay tuned for announcements of availability.

If you're unfamiliar, clans are communities of like-minded Destiny players who are able to journey through the game together and benefit from each other's achievements. Although they exist in the original Destiny, they were only accessible through the Destiny website and function essentially in the background. And Destiny 2, much like the story of Destiny, they've been overhauled and brought to the forefront of gameplay, featuring, featuring in the user interface and allowing Guardians to join their fellow players on-the-fly, creating fireteams with other clan members and leveling the clan up as individual members work their way through the game. Does this break your heart, Anthony? No, because my own personal meta game with online multiplayer games to see how much of it I can do alone anyway. Social player.

Lone wolf in it. And lone wolf in it. We all know that one. Well, yeah, yeah. How about you? Yeah, we formed an IGN clan, I think, early on, and I was in it, but I never used it for anything. Yeah, I, I never raided in the original Destiny, 'cause like I had fallen off by the time all that really started happening, right? And so we've made, there's a lot of kids tweeting me last night about, hey, I want to join the Kinda Funny raid where, or the clan, where is it? I'm like, well, again, there's one up on the forums in the Facebook people have made, but there's only a hundred in there. And so I say, just go off and make it.

But I'm not opening that up 'cause it's gonna be keen. I hate, it's so complicated to get people in and get them out. And like, I really, maybe I'm wrong, I want to see what happens with my addiction to Destiny 2 before I invite other people into it, 'cause I only let them down. And I've also found that clans and, and sort of factions in different games to me really serve a peripheral purpose. Like, I joined one in, I joined one in Injustice 2 just because like I wanted to play Multiverse planets, sure. And then I found that most people play it the way that I do, where like nobody was talking to each other. Nobody. Exactly.

WB won't profit from Shadow of War DLC via Eurogamer. Had you been following this last week, Anthony Carboni? I wasn't following much last week because of PAX. So Mike Forgey, he, or maybe Forgey, there's just, there's debate on the internet of how to say, because he's little. If you, anyways, doesn't matter. Passed away. He was working on this game, right?

Warner Bros. is selling before we, this is the other thing, Forgey Orc Slayer DLC for $4.99. And it said it would donate $3.50 of every purchase to the Forgey family throughout, through the 31st of December 2019.

We followed up, this is Eurogamer again, we followed up with the Warner Bros. to ask an explanation, and it sent over the following statement, quote, neither Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment nor Monolith Productions will profit from any sales of the Forgey Orc Slayer DLC, regardless of the territory in which the DLC is sold. Period. End of statement. Okay.

For me personally, this is even worse of a PR move. You know, people, because what happened is he got announced, we talked about on the show, I think it was Tim and me, and we, I was like, this is awesome. It's a really cool way to honor him. I'm glad they're doing this. I'm glad they're getting to work on something for the friend. I'm glad money's making its way to the family.

I told Nintendo that Switch wouldn't be a success before it went on sale because I thought that in the age of the smartphone, no one would carry around a game console. It's obvious I was wrong. I came to realize the key to succeed. Oh, xxxx. Well, stick it, Tsunekazu Ishihara. I came to realize the key to a successful game is quite simple. Software with absolute quality leads sales of hardware. Playing safe can be flexible if the software is attractive enough. Playing style, playing style taught me. Thank you very much, Tsunekazu.

So I'm gonna give you these quotes as well. Yeah, with the Switch, he explained, we see it as a chance to create Pok\u00e9mon that goes deeper and with a higher level of expression. As a result, that makes it an extremely important platform. Right now, we're using seven to eight inch screens, but on a high definition TV, you can express a whole different world with graphics and sound. Until now, games were made as one, one for one person. But now you can go home and play with everyone. So how do we tackle these themes and how do we make sure it's not complicated?

As for whether a new Pok\u00e9mon game would come with extra peripherals, previous games have introduced the Pok\u00e9walker, the Pok\u00e9walker, Pok\u00e9walker, and Game Link ZR. Totally. Come on, guys. E-Ring toys. He said, quote, I can't say that we'll release accessories, but I'd like to think of that possibility. I got a lot of thoughts about this. Do you like Pok\u00e9mon?

According to an interview Suda gave to the YouTube channel GameXplain, Travis Strikes Again will feature similar gameplay to the first two No More Heroes games, which employed a mix of motion and traditional button controls. The game will feature motion controls, but more importantly, it can be played entirely with one Joy-Con, Tony. According to Suda, co-op play was not confirmed, but Suda hinted that it was something that was on their mind. Yeah, love and No More Heroes. I love it. No More Heroes.

He was very clear in the interview as well, like, this is not a seat, this is not a numbered sequel to No More Heroes. No, well, I think it's interesting because No More Heroes came at a time when the sort of self-aware mixing of pop culture universes wasn't happening as much in major stuff.

On August 27th, for the first time, it became the biggest game on Steam in terms of concurrent players, temporarily surpassing Dota 2. Wow. PUBG is now far, now far outpacing. Today's peak player count was over 960,000 compared with 73,000 for Dota 2. That still isn't an all-time record as Dota 2 has topped 1 million before, but PUBG may get there yet. Golly, man.

Thanks, love the show every day. Keeping, I'm not super, I, I didn't play a lot of Wildlands. I maybe, I maybe just kind of dipped into it real quick. But um, this feels kind of apples and oranges to me. Yeah, as like what grabbed you about what would Wildlands need to do",

Yeah, as like what grabbed you about what would Wildlands need to do that Destiny's doing? And it's like, I don't know, spaceships. I, I like, I don't know, know why we were super excited the demo and we all played together and you're like, \"Holy shit, there's a lot of fun.\" When we got it here, we did a stream and where we all played together. And for me, the problem with it was, and it might have been that we've jumped in together, like Destiny, you jump in with other people. Me and Andy did it yesterday, right? And the story and the objectives are all simple enough that you can go through and fuck around with each other and tell each other dumb stories and do this and not have to be fully invested in the world and what's happening. Yeah, whereas with Wildlands, it was like, \"Alright, cool. We failed the mission. Why?\" It makes like, \"I shot a guy.\" I'm like, \"Why? Easy the house.\" You know,",

Like, what can you focus on the far right? You're doing that. And like, how do you, okay, I'm dead over here. Oh yeah, Kevin set off this random raid. It's for people who want to get in, do something to murder based tactical play their part. Yet his squad do the thing. That's what he hits on with like comparing it to Metal Gear Solid V, right? Like Metal Gear Solid V is such a fucking awesome game, but it would have been a nightmare to have four Snakes running in there and like, and one of them, you know, as we're like, \"Do it stealthy.\" He's got the number of balloons, the number of things attached to",

Shout out to Alfredo's place. Also the PC version is coming out later than the other versions usually do does not affect PC sales if it is a highly sought-after title for example GTA V came out a year later on PC after it was announced at the same time as the PlayStation 4 version and that sold 1 million copies on PC on day one keep up the good work Tunde.
