The Superman thing, the three-hour extended cut of the original movie is gonna be available Blu-ray. That's why we're out here. I mean, that's great news. If you haven't seen this, is it the Donner Cut? No, it's, well, okay, so let's go into it. It is, there was apparently a two-night thing that happened on ABC in 1980 where they showed 40 extra minutes of footage and they've never showed it again, and apparently they're releasing that whole thing, so it's going to about three hours long. It's more of Marlon Brando struggling with his lines on",

Yeah, that's pretty much all I could glean from this behind it again. You would Superman, you may have seen, oh, you may have seen some of this is deleted scenes, brother. Since ABC's broadcast, some of the footage included in the extended cut has made its way into previous releases of Superman: The Movie as deleted scenes, but the full 188-minute version that airs over those two days in February has never been officially released until now. So they're releasing a collection of Superman: The Extended Edition, which I'm sure you've seen, and Superman: The Movie, I guess, yeah, the special edition as well. So the special is an extended edition. I don't know the difference. We're heating into Blade Runner territory here, sure.",

A lot of people are asking whether or not I in fact do play games. I do play games. I just like to make fun of people because I'm an insecure bully. Mmm, that's just the way it goes. It's true. Yeah, that was the whole point of us bringing it up is they like that when you don't understand something, you just make fun of it cuz you feel insecure. There's that, but",

Greg, let me just explain to you a little bit about Pauly Shore right now. In the late 80s, Pauly Shore rose to fame by making some amazing, amazing movies like Encino Man. He was also on MTV Spring Break. I believe he hosted that for a little while. He basically like was one of, I don't know if he's original, an MTV guy, but he hosts a lot of MTV stuff.

That's when when the person that's the attendant of the person that's working there's not looking, you go to the slushie machine and you just pour as much slushy into your mouth until you get kicked out. And that's what's that's not injured. He did start that. He did start weezing the juice. Then he made, I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna throw this out at you, Encino Man. Two friends find a caveman. They farm out at the hangout with them. Great movie. Son-in-Law. He goes to a farm in the Midwest and they think he's gay and it's awesome.

Then you've got the fourth movie in this amazing installment, In the Army Now, in which he goes to the army. Yeah, classic. He was also featured in a hit movie called A Goofy Movie where he was the third best friend. Remember the god, the cheese guy? So he does the cheese thing as a cartoon dog, but he was still like the Weasel. I miss Pauly Shore. I do. You know, Anastasi, it was just there. You know, he's here. He's here. I was pretty mad.
