I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the busiest lady in the business, Andrea Rene. OMG, Destiny 2! There are so many questions about Destiny 2 in here. Like, it's all anybody's playing, it's all anybody's talking about. There's a lot of news that doesn't revolve around Destiny 2. That's true. Some stuff is happening. Lots, as always. iPhone, iPhone, right? There's only people keep getting in trouble and all sorts of stuff going on down here. Are you excited for the new iPhone? No, because I have, I had the iPhone 7 and I just, the jump between iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 isn't a big enough leap for me to reinvest. Apple, how dare you? Cold. You can't just jump over the nine. Like, what about iPhone 9? Or as somebody on Twitter said, I think it was Christian Spicer, who was like, well, are they intentionally going to make the 9 underpowered for what the 10 is? That doesn't make sense either. Let's keep moving from here. Yes, you",

How expensive? Maybe. No, ladies and gentlemen, this is Kinda Funny Games Daily.

For some, there are six items on the Roper Report. Oh, a baker's dozen. Number one, PewDiePie has responded to the drama from the weekend. This is The Guardian's article.

In a short video posted to his account, the vlogger said he was not going to make any excuses as to why he said the N-word in the middle of a game of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, because there are no excuses for it. Quote, \"I'm disappointed in myself because it seems like I've learned nothing from these past controversies.\" All these past controversies, he added, referring to the widespread backlash from advertising and business partners after a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed multiple times the once child-friendly star had used anti-Semitic or Nazi imagery as the punchline to jokes. Quote, \"It's not that I think I can say or do whatever I want and get away with it. That's not it at all. I'm just an idiot, but that doesn't make what I said or how I said it okay.\" PewDiePie continued, \"It was not okay. I'm really sorry if I offended, hurt, or disappointed anyone.\"",

I should know better and I owe it to my audience to be and myself to be better than this.\" PewDiePie's statement has received a mixed reception from his commentators. While it is, I'm more, it is a more, you know what, conciliatory, how do I say it? Conciliatory, that sounds right. All right, apology than that issued by the star following the Wall Street Journal's investigation, where he rallied against out of context reports into his use of anti-Semitic imagery as punchlines to jokes. It repeats the defense that PewDiePie used racist language only in the heat of the moment. Quote, \"I've played video games my entire life and I've definitely done and seen people do dumb things in the heat of the moment,\" wrote Motherboard's Emanuel Maiberg. \"But I've never\"",

Hearing people yell the N-word over voice chat is easily one of the worst things about video games and internet culture in general. And this is the type of behavior Kjellberg participated in and promoted to his 57 million subscribers on YouTube.\" Andrea, yes, well, you weren't on yesterday's show. Yeah, I listened to the yesterday's show and I watched the video of his apology this morning. And I think it's important to like, look at the video versus just reading the statement because I think the tone of the manner of which he delivers his apology is the appropriate one. He absolutely needed to apologize. What he did was despicable. I don't think anybody is denying that. I am with you guys that there is a",

I am with you guys that there is a difficult line when we're talking about, is he like propagating racist culture? Is he a racist? And I don't think he is. I think he said what he is, he's an idiot. Yeah, because I've heard this word, I've heard other words, I've heard worse things said to me over voice chat many times. People that say those kinds of things are just idiotic people. And I've had to tell certain people in my groups where I'll be online gaming and I'm very selective about who I game with online for a variety of reasons. But sometimes one of my clan mates will be like, hey, can I bring another person in? And you know, I'll be like, yeah, sure, because I assume if they're bringing them in, they've got to be a cool person. Yeah, but sometimes they'll come on and then they'll say things and then I'll have to immediately be like, hey, yo,",

Yeah, and a lot of times they'll get defensive and yell at me and then I'll leave the party and I won't be friends with them anymore. Yeah, and it sucks that it has to be that way. But I, it never ceases to amaze me that there are still a significant amount of people out there who, who don't say these things because they're trying to propagate hate. They say because they're stupid. And I feel comfortable using that word because you don't have to use that kind of language when you're upset and in the moment. And when I look at PewDiePie's case in particular, he has shown that he has made idiotic choices for someone in his position. Now, has he made also very smart business choices in a variety of other ways? Of course. So that's why these",

And I think what's interesting about the statement from, you know, Emanuel Maiberg, he says, \"I've never seen a friend hurl a racist slur.\" I've never either, because I don't, I'm not friends with those kinds of people. Sure. And if I've ever heard a friend say something like that, they would no longer be my friend. That's for me, that's the biggest thing about it, right? And PewDiePie's apology, you're just using this word or these kind of insults in general, is the fact that it's the disconnect. We're using the N-word, calling someone a b****, just calling someone a d***. Like, there's all this different stuff going around and it's obviously case by case. But there's plenty of people, and I talk about it, like I",

Up growing up, throwing around, oh, that's so gay, and this, so that it's not that they're on the same level. It's just the same argument of being so emotionally disconnected from another person or a group of people that you can't see why that would offend them until someone, you, it brings that up. And it's same thing about, you know, I went to school in Missouri, and you know, the University of Missouri a couple years ago, I was in a whole mess of trouble about racial tension and stuff like that. And I never saw racism on the campus, but I definitely met people that I respected and hung out with and blah, blah, blah. And then all of a sudden, they'd casually dropped the N-word. And I have to be like, whoa, man, that's not cool at all. And they, but you know what I mean, though? I don't mean",

Maybe you shouldn't be using it then. And that was the same thing of it was for those, for the couple friends I'm thinking of from very small towns or whatever, it was a come-to-Jesus moment of like, okay, I understand you're saying, and I won't say that anymore. No, and that's why we're friends and that's why there's a relationship here. It's not just somebody who's spouting it off. And so I'm not at all defending PewDiePie in any way. And that's the thing, like I was talked about yesterday, right? If like, this isn't 18-year-olds trying to come to, this is a man who is at the forefront of YouTube, who is the most popular person, who is a business savvy human being. He understands these",

He understands these moves. And I can't, I, I can't get the disconnect there. Yes, if why he would think that'd be okay or in any way, right? And you guys have discussed it yesterday about how can somebody say something like that in the heat of the moment? It clearly indicates that this word is part of their vernacular and that they're using it in other context. Because, you know, mention in the article here, like, I never say that word. People I know never use that word because it's just not a word you say. And I think what's interesting about his apology is like, I think that this is probably like the last straw for him. Yeah, I was, this apology is important for his business partners. But if he makes a mistake again, like, it's done for him. That's my question for you. This is his last time to get away with.

And that's the kind of frustrating part about this is that a lot of people out there can say like, boycott his content, advertisers pull your funds. But he's just reached a critical mass where like, you can't stop his influence, clear as indicated by how many thousands, if not millions, of his fans have come to his defense in with this incident. And so I think what we need to do is go, okay, look, we can't stop his influence. It's huge. I think we need to do is recognize that he recognizes that he made a gigantic mistake. He immediately apologized for, and the apology was the kind of apology it needed to be. And say, okay, this is literally like the last time we're gonna let you off the hook. And then next time, like, it's done, man, for real-z. Like, you",

Like, I, and this is all, this is the hardest thing. I'm sure his lawyers got involved and he couldn't react immediately because a lot of other things were probably at stake, which, you know, if I was on his legal team, I'd be like, don't say anything yet. But I mean, I, and that's the thing is like, it's always so hard in any situation like this where there's drama on this magnitude. But yeah, I'll never have to worry about, right?

Now, I'm gonna have you read this one, because you tossed this in there right as we were going in. I did the Kinda Funny Morning Show. Jenova Chen walks out on stage at the Apple conference. What, what is Sky? What's happening? Okay, so this story comes from TechRadar. Apple looks keen to make a big gamey push with new Apple TV 4K set-top box, revealing it's poached a key studio from core console platform holders, Sony, at its iPhone 8 launch event. That Game Company, the devs behind the critically acclaimed Journey, is developing its title, Sky, exclusively for Apple platforms. And while it's coming to iPhone and iPad, it's the Apple TV 4K version that's getting the most attention. Sky's a multiplayer focus adventure game, clearly taking its cues",

Players will fly above the clouds and souls in social groups, traveling to dark temples and bringing light to these dangerous corners of its world in order to summon magical creatures. The game will take advantage of the Metal API graphics programming language, as well as the set-top box's A10 Fusion chip, to deliver what looks to be a very silky 4K visuals. Sky's currently slated for some point this winter, provided you've got an iPhone, iPad, or of course, the Apple TV 4K. Then you put in all caps, it's basically Journey. I mean, looks good. I mean, it's, it looks like That Game Company game. Good. Okay. Yeah, so I mean, I haven't, you know, gotten an in-depth look at this game. Sure, just a very brief.

And so if it's more Journey, I'm all for it. Yeah, that'll be the interesting thing when we talk to Jenova Chen back in 2015 at GDC, when he came on the streams or whatever it was. I remember the question was like, so is there a lot of pressure, you know, to follow up Journey? Like, you have no idea. You knew how many times we had stopped and started and restarted projects trying to figure out what the next thing was going to be. Yeah, so it's cool. It's finally there for them.

We love Battle Royale games like PUBG and thought Fortnite would make a great foundation for our own version. A few months ago, Epic's Unreal Tournament team began experimenting with the mode while the original Fortnite team kept updating the core game to maintain game balance. We kept the PvP mode completely separate from the PvE mode. The new Battle Royale mode was so much fun, we decided to share it with everyone to get feedback. This is also a great time for new Fortnite members to jump in because this week only, September 12th through the 18th, we have a 25% discount on our Standard and Deluxe Edition Founder Packs.

Why you love Fortnite? Yes, I do love Fortnite. Okay, lay it on me. So when I heard, I heard whispers from the team at Epic that they were working on another mode and that PvP may be involved. I had no idea it was going to be a Battle Royale mode. So this is really fun because not only is it just PvP, but it incorporates the things about Fortnite that I really love. So if you watch the video with McDonald, who is great by the way, he he shows them coming in on an airplane very similar to PUBG. Then you kind of glide in with like your, it looks like the Zelda glider, and then you only have your pickaxe and then you go throughout the world and you have to scavenge for your resources for your gun and you aren't just going out to shoot other players, but you can like build your own fort to hide out in.

Like, am I gonna use like the electricity trap? We're gonna use like the gas trap? Or am I gonna use like this the spikes that are stationary? Are the ones that like poke up through the ground? I don't know. Maybe I'm gonna use all of them. Yeah, maybe I'm gonna set like a little death alley for you to walk down if you want to come and shoot me. I think it puts enough of a twist on the formula that it makes it a lot more fun for people like me who need something else to do besides just run and find somebody to shoot.

Today Epic Games announced their update for Fortnite.\" She goes on to recap, \"Thank you so much. I've seen a lot of mixed comments swirling around about this one being that this is a misstep for Epic as the core game of Fortnite is still littered with issues. I'm inclined to disagree. They want to put a fun mode in their game, more power to them, especially one that is this hot right now. What are your thoughts on it? Are you gonna try it out or you couldn't care less?\" Obviously, you're gonna try it. Where you come down because so many people did write in being like, \"They said this is going to be PvE game.

And that's why they very explicitly were like, \"Hey, our Fortnite team is still working on PvE. It's clearly still in early access. There's a lot of kinks to work out.\" That's why the Unreal Tournament team is the team working on this PvP mode. Epic is a big place. There's a lot of people working there. So I have no doubt that there are plenty of people still working on PvE, but game development takes time. I was one of the many people out there very critical of all the things that were wrong with Fortnite, despite the fact that I really, really enjoy that game and I wish I could get back to it, but I'm just like so obsessed with Destiny right now.

We do not carry players through the raid and we take the time to explain every mechanic. Our goal is to make it so you don't ever have to",

I have helped groups ranging from hardcore players of I'm sorry are from hardcore players - - father - - father-and-son teams over the past three years. We have helped out just over three I'm sorry thirty thousand Guardians and we are ready to go full force into Destiny 2.

Thanks for everything you guys do. Listening to KFG D is the best part of my day and I find myself refreshing the podcast app in anticipation every night. Derek, aka Smoldering Ego on Xbox One. Derek, what a lovely little community you have. That's awesome and it speaks back to the question we had earlier, a good palate cleanser to end down. There are good people on the internet just like you Best Friends. Up, I do want to say just as a clarification here we go. It was meant as a joke but I should have made a different joke than the slap your face joke. I just wanted like clarify that right now that I made a big rant about violence and then",

I just wanted like clarify that right now that I made a big rant about violence and then I ended it with a joke about violence and that was the wrong move. And that's a big of you say and I think a great point of the takeaway from that is what I was talking about - its tone. Clearly someone watching this understands you don't mean that you'd slap them in the face, but if you were to tweet at Luke Smith or whoever, I mean Appy oh no, I'm contacting Bungie on this Epic thing. Do you understand like that doesn't carry tone? That does. They don't know you. They don't know what you're **** talking about. That reads as, oh, this guy wants to hit me. He doesn't like what I did. Yes, so I just I needed to I need to clarify that so that was I shouldn't have done that. Well, thank you, Andrea.

Yeah, PewDiePie pronounces his last name Kjellberg. Kjellberg. Thank you. I never know. Also, somebody pointed out that his apology video is monetized, which I think should affect how we view it. I don't think we need to get into that discussion, but you think about that and think about how that makes you feel. The Sky game is not exclusive to Apple TV and iOS. It was clarified it is coming to Apple products first, but it will go elsewhere after. No, thank you. Waiting from a PlayStation trophy. Greg said Destiny 2 hasn't crashed for him. It literally crashed the first time he streamed it. No, you stupid **** idiot. You remember pretty clearly that was Jen logging into my other PlayStation 4, wasn't it? Get you delete your Twitter.

You know, you know what's funny is that somebody immediately after him said you're wrong at crash because Jen logged in. Who said that? That PR guy. That PR. Oh yeah, a new development from him. He also added, adding to the Destiny 2 microtransaction blues, earning loot boxes through gameplay will take longer and longer after earning your first five. You can check this discussion on our the Reddit, the Destiny game Reddit, and he has an editorial as you think, which I want read. Okay, so the Bright Engrams of like once. Oh, I see.

Somebody out there who's doing this right now or myself or whoever, and you you I'm gonna buy some of these Bright Engrams. I'm gonna go buy this Silver and stuff. But does it make more sense to wait until you're way higher level or you're way higher power level to do it, or does it not matter? It depends what you want the Engrams for. If only me as powerful as **** possible. If you want to be as powerful as possible, you want to do a little column A, little column B, because you can't get powerful without getting high-level gear and you can't get high-level gear without getting Exotics. So once you get your first Exotic, that'll help immediately boost your power level.

And then the thing that's confusing, and I don't know how long we want to go into this, but like the thing is confusing is the way that Engrams, the dropping of Engrams, worked in Destiny was that you had to equip your highest Light Level gear before you went to talk to the Cryptarch. So let's say I had a pair of boots that I liked, but they weren't my highest Light Level. Before I would go decrypt all of my Engrams at the Cryptarch, I would move around my inventory and make sure each piece of the and then you had to do this dance where you would decrypt one Engram at a time. And if it was a higher Light Level, you had to go and equip that one thing. So you couldn't just hit Bam Bam Bam Bam. And I mean, you could, but you were wasting potential opportunity to get higher gear because the grind once you get up there is literally one point at a time. Sure, sure. So what I would do is I would then equipped my highest level gear and then go decrypt another one. It clipped the highest level thing.",

It clipped the highest level thing, decrypt another one. That was the grind in Destiny and it was maddening, but it was what you had to do. Okay, it's that's not the case now. Okay, so now the Cryptarch will take into account your whatever is the highest power level in your inventory. However, it's important to know that your Engrams will drop at the rate at the level that you are currently at. So that being said, if you're going to be farming for specific kinds of Engrams, you might want to figure out if you want to decrypt, if you want to hold on to your reputation tokens before you cash them in at a specific faction vendor. For example, like if I have a bunch of tokens for Failsafe or for the fall or whoever, maybe I don't want to go turn them in right now because my level is a high enough and then I'll get in an Engram or something to",

So something to think about it. That's terrifying. There's two. I just don't like thinking about it so much. Excited. Yeah, the specifics of how this works is still being discovered. The science is still being figured out as we correct. Is that it? That's it. Final question then is Kevin, what are you eating? It smells delightful. He's got to turn it as a microphone. It's a shrimp sausage and some sauteed vegetables. You said shrimp sausage. Did shrimp comma sausage? Okay. It smells it smells like Marnie's high from way back in the day. Good job.
