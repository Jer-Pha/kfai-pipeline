If you\u2019re following my example, it\u2019s\u2026\nSpinach\nBroccoli\nProsciutto\nPepper jack cheese\nMarconi Hot Giardiniera diced\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP OMELETTE INSTRUCTIONS\n1) Decide what you want in that bitch and prep it all before. Cut up your spinach, shred your cheese, etc.\n2) Crack two eggs into a bowl and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.\n3) Whisk those eggs, man!\n4) Get a nonstick skillet, put it on the stove, and light it up a little past medium. Let it get hot. We\u2019ll say a minute and a half.\n5) Drop some butter in there and spread it around to grease the pan -- if you\u2019re using a nonstick skillet, use a bunch of butter!\n6) Pour your eggs in. Use a spatula to pull from the outside of the pan in and the move the pan to fill the holes with egg.\n7) As it starts to firm up (about a minute or minute and a half), start adding the ingredients. I like to start with a cheese base, then veg, then meat. But it\u2019s your call, man.\n8) I like my omelettes runny, but if you want them less juicy, that\u2019s cool. Once the cheese is melted in and you have a pretty mix, get in there and flip one side over to make the perfect omelette. If you\u2019re following me to a T, you\u2019re waiting between 30 seconds to a minute after everything is on there before the flip, but this is all done by watching and deciding. It\u2019s fast!\n9) Serve!\n\nTHE POTATOES\nINGREDIENTS FOR TATERS\nPotatoes\nOlive oil\nSalt\nPepper\nRosemary\nThyme\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP TATER INSTRUCTIONS\n1) Wash them taters. \n2) Dice them taters into bite size-cubes.\n3) Put \u2018em in a bowl of cold water to destrach\u2019em. Drain them. Cover them in water again. Repeat until the water is no longer cloudy. If you wanna plan ahead, you can do this the night before and leave them in the water and covered overnight. They won\u2019t brown!\n4) Get a cast iron skillet. Turn it up to medium high. Put some olive oil in there. You want the whole pan covered.\n5) Towel dry the taters.\n6) Gettin\u2019 some good heat off that oil? Toss them taters in there, man!\n7) Salt and pepper the taters. Toss in the rosemary and thyme, too. Repeat this to taste as you turn the taters.\n8) This is where I should tell you a time to cook\u2019em, but it\u2019s really up to you. If you like\u2019em CRISPY like me, they\u2019re gonna go for 10 minutes or longer. Regardless, turn them taters at your leisure.\n9) They look done to your liking? Great. They\u2019re done. Turn off the heat, dump\u2019em on a paper towel, and then serve\u2019em!\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids",
