Like if I had a fever and I had an infection and I had to take a medicine called Biaxin. It was a yellow pill, big-ass **** pill for a small child to take. Hated those, man. So and this pill was the only pill that I ever took that when you put it on your tongue, it made you gag 'cause it tasted so bad. So I I cannot tear apart the flavor of Glacier Freeze and the Biaxin pill. Whenever I taste Glacier Freeze, all those memories come rushing back on me vomiting. Know it. See a look for a Glacier Freeze or just Gatorade Freeze. Yeah. Gatorade flavor. Look at that popping up already. Whoo. This thing. What we got? Oh yeah, it's the baby blue one. More of a teal. Well, no, that's not teal. It has no green in it. That's just blue. That is.",

And it whenever I would take that pill, I would like vomit a lot because I would like like it's so gross. When I was a kid, they used to give you antibiotics when you have any sort of cold. And if you were anywhere the loose, if you sneeze, you want to **** hair her like, \"Hey, we're gonna give you these **** insane antibiotics.\" But they when I was a kid, I used to love getting sick because they give it to me in the form of this uh this pink like fluid that tasted like bubblegum.

It's total months that we're about Gatorade. And I can't remember who tweeted it. I wish I could shout this person out. But the tweet read something and I'm paraphrasing, which was, \"If you're with someone who knows the actual name of the Gatorade flavors and doesn't refer to them by the color, he's 100% a cop.\" Like usually like, \"I want the blue one.\" \"No, the light blue one.\" Nobody **** knows it's called Frost Glacier. It's 'cause it scarred me, man. It's like, \"You're a cop, bro.\" No, dude. It's scarred me. A **** narc. You're a **** pig.

But I saw it on other people's screens and I was like, \"God damn this movie.\" It just made me tense. It made me nervous. You're watching it. Then there was this kid in front of me that was the most annoying human being I've ever seen in my life. Not because he did anything specifically to me, but because what he was doing was randomly clicking into movies, randomly take him little scrollbar. You know, they're digital now. You can just scroll in. We've been watching like five seconds, scrolling back, scrolling forward, clicking into another movie.
