I feel like people have gotten better about it nowadays where it is like no you're still with the same mechanics no we know the game was strong enough that we can give you an end boss fight that isn't super out of the ordinary and super weird and like that catches you off guard and isn't fun night. I mean I think about like when you look at the Uncharted ending boss battles right where it's like Uncharted one ends and it's like this weird fist fight that you have not done at all this entire game. It's like why is this weird ass McCain and then beat you know Lost Legacy you'd be like cool I've done this before in this game I understand how all this all got builds together and again that entire journey is interesting not that one boss fight they want to make it but I understand two of like you've built in a video games in general you've built me up to be the ultimate character but here's my ultimate villain.

Yeah how can he really match you in a way that isn't well I mean I think it just it comes back to the gameplay and it's like is it something where it's like you've earned your skills over the the experience and now this is the thing of like challenging you with that and it couldn't be a slight twist but it's when it's completely different that I don't like. Halo I think it's a great example. Halo one is a good example of you know you've been using the Warthog the entire time but now at the end it's like it's a chase scene or like things are exploding you got to get out of there but it's still gameplay that you've played the entire time whereas Devil May Cry one is probably the biggest insult to me of this where you play through this whole game and it has a certain style and then the final boss is you're",
