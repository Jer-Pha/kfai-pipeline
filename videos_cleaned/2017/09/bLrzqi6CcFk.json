I like my MacBook. It's super light, easy to move back and forth. Just for this spacebar doesn't really work anymore, so I kind of need to get that fixed. But if I'm at, I really like it. P. Popov asks, hey Joey and Andy, I feel like we share musical taste. What are you guys listening to currently? Hmm, still on that sweet, sweet Brand New album. Mm-hmm. Can you get into it, Charlie? I tried, man. That's a bummer. I really like it. I'm seeing Brand New on Tuesday here in San Francisco, so I'm very excited about that. And I started listening to Phantogram the other day. Yeah, because it's blocking my Uber and I was like, oh, I really dig this. Some kind of",

If I would have known that I liked them, I would have gone to that concert. That was the same RTX where a woman passed out and fell down on the ground and hit her face on the concrete. Horrifying. At the concert, like in the backstage. I like yank all the roots deep. People were like in that back building and it had AC. Thank God they don't have to be out there in the in the hot, hot heat with all those sweaty bodies. Woman walks in and she's took my back, but me, Tim and my old boss Michael Hadwin from Rooster Teeth came to talking and then suddenly like I see their face and they just go and they make like a vase and I hear straight up like there's nothing worse than that fan.

She said all she slipped on the beer and he was like, no, no, she dropped the beer. She like walked in, she tried to dance and her knees like buckled because she's so up. Yeah, and she just fell face down and hit her face on the concrete and all of us are like super worried. Luckily there was some paramedics either they came to picked her up and she was like kind of walking towards it and then she collapsed again. Like it was so scary. I thought she died. I thought like I just watched a woman die. Yeah, luckily she's still alive. They put on a good enough show that I forgot about a woman that almost died. Yeah, that's pretty good show.

I'd say that I'm probably, I'm still listening to like when I'm bored with music, when I have free time, listen to music. It's like right now it's, it's Logic or it's Kendrick Lamar or it's like some random band that I forgot existed like, like Boys Like Girls. That, man. Yeah, I was like, oh, they're a good band. I mean, they have like some solid singles. I'm yeah, yeah, random Hidden in Plain View. That's like really random. Say Anything because I think I'm gonna go see that. I think I'm gonna go see Say Anything live. Looking, you should go. I miss their best album. They're playing in front to back.

Yeah, um, so yeah, um, Schism says, Andy and Joey, can we have an Are You Afraid of the Dark? Midnight Society type watch along around Halloween? We can watch something spooky like, not spooky like Hocus Pocus. Dude, I love Are You Afraid of the Dark? The one with the spectacles. They like put glasses on. They would suddenly just see dudes in like black body suits running around and it would take the glasses off and they were gone. They scare the he has a kid, man. I could not watch that episode.

It was the one with the girl put on the mask. Aren't you gonna get it off? The Haunted Mask. Yeah, yeah. There was a, there was a Goosebumps book that was like a popular read for Accelerated Reader points back in the day. Did you ever do AR? Gotta think. I don't think so. AR was like you'd read books, you'd take quizzes and then you'd get like coupons for for Peter Piper Pizza or pizza. Okay, we had booked it as well. Okay, okay. But uh, yeah, that was one about like a superhero with a kid like jumped into the comic book or there subir came out of the comic book. I don't remember what it was bad, but I love Goosebumps.

I forgot what the rest of it is called. Yeah, Oh, Fear Through the Eyes of Madness. I forgot it's called. Love Coheed. Whose Brand New album, haha, has made sticker. What a joker. One little joke of that boy is I just put it into subscribers only mode because they're gone a little late. We are kind of late. Yeah, yeah. Ryan Santelli has an e. Do you play any Fantasy Football? I'm in a league this year again, just like last year. I wasn't there, Ryan, for the actual draft last year.

So I'm in the league. I don't give a about it though, as much as I used to. I used to be a die-hard though. SirenSong87 says, Joey, do you like Alexisonfire? Just City and Colour. I didn't really listen to a ton of Alexisonfire on my friends' dad, but I really got loved City and Colour, so I'm sure that I would like them. I kind of feel the same way about Daryl Palumbo of like, I really, really liked Head Automatica, but I never really listened to Glassjaw. Mmm, I see what you're saying.

Uh, I said this the other day, if he really did hit a girl, him. He's beat of right. Yeah, but there's a lot of shady stuff regarding the girl about her like trying to extort him and trying to like, you know, blackmail him for a sex tape. Wire cutter texts really. Essentially the NFL, the lead investigator for this, like the right, like one of the top people in the NFL told Roger Goodell, the Commissioner, hey, based on the evidence, you shouldn't suspend. And and so she, that's what she told him. She was like, there's the evidence isn't there. You should not suspend him. And then Roger Goodell was like, you know what? Six-game suspension.

He won't be, he'll have six less games of big bodies slamming into them. So that's not a kind of sexual. Last question, which I also saw somebody earlier in the chat asking, so I'm gonna say it for both of us. Let's talk about Mario + Rabbids. Are you playing? No. Cool. Good show. You nervous like XCOM? No, I'm not a strategy type, turn-based type of dude. I will say, Andy, like the Lakers had 4-3. Andy, remember with Joey Crawford tossed out Tim Duncan for laughing? I do. It's a good clip to check out. Joey, essentially Joey Crawford, old referee, got mad at Tim Duncan for a foul. Well, like he sat out. They pulled that Tim Duncan because of a foul that he thought was kind of dumb. And Tim Duncan was on the bench.",

Like kind of laughing, not even saying, not saying anything, just kind of laughing and joking. Joey Crawford turns around like, you out! Like kicks him out. And they're like, kick. It was a great moment. And they talked to Joey Crawford after the fact, like several years later once he retired and he was like, yeah, I shouldn't have done that. I was just, I don't know why I did that. Was he anywhere close to fouling out or anything? No, no. They kicked him out of the game for like, I don't know, as if he was like getting in a fight with somebody. That's sort of like nice sort of ejection. But I figured like if he had four fouls or something like that. Oh no, then like, no, but if you, that's dumb. It was really silly. Thank you.",
