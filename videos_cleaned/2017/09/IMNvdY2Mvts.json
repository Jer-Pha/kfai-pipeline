Hello. Hey, Gary. I'm Larry Schwartz today as well, so it's quite the high-risk venture for me to be in this close proximity to you with exposed knees. It's why can't I don't have, well, that's the, I insisted on a house like this. Gotta be. Yeah. How have you been, sir? I've been great. I've been keeping busy. Yeah, doing some, some fun projects. The book that we were just talking about is out on Tuesday. Excited about that. Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View out on Tuesday. Book you worked on? Yes. Even watch a Star Wars? You have a Star Wars story in there? Yes, I do. Because what's, what the elevator pitch for the book? 40, 40, 40 stories from more than 40 different authors retelling the story of the original Star Wars film from the point of view of background characters that you saw in the movie but didn't necessarily think about.

That's such a great idea. Yeah, it's really fun. So it's like you get to go back and kind of relive scenes from the movie but maybe with like a different perspective because it's how someone else viewed what was happening in this. That's rad. Yeah, and some of them are kind of dark and serious and you know, emotional. Others are really funny and surely like it's all over the map. I don't, you know, and we talked about this in the morning show today, available at YouTube.com/KindaFunny. But how did you, did you get to pick? Do you get to pitch? How did you get your story?

But then they came to me as well and said, do you want to do a little story? And I said, yeah, because of my association with Rogue One, they wanted me to do something. It was kind of Rogue One related. So I got to do the, like I said, the story that bridges the gap between the very, the final frame of Rogue One and the very end, the very first frame of A New Hope.

Now, of course, before Rogue One, before From a Certain Point of View, before Book of UI, you reviewed video games. Did I? Was yet. I had a whole career in video games before I moved into screenwriting. I was editor-in-chief of PC Gamer magazine, originally in the UK and then came over here. This what brought me over to the U.S. from the UK, '96. I became editor-in-chief of the American edition of PC Gamer. So are you ready to dust off those gaming chops and do Kinda Funny Games Daily?

For now, Gary, let's begin the show with what is and forever will be the Roper Report for some news. Three items on the Roper Report, a baker's dozen. Thank you, Kevin. Number one, Gary, the Red Dead Redemption 2 trailer has hit. I haven't seen it but I knew it was coming. Yeah, I'm sure the very first thing that I do once I get away from here will be to watch it. I'm very excited. It looks Red Dead Redemption, yeah, is one of the truly great games. 100%. One of the all-time classic games. Yeah, yes.

What's your stuff? Okay, it basically confirms that the Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel. Okay. It is a new character and Rockstar officially described it as Red Dead Redemption 2: The story of outlaw Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang. Now that's Dutch's gang from, you know, from the first game. So it's not, so it's not Marston anymore. But no, but there's some cars cross over. Exactly. So it's the Van der Linde gang as they rob, fight, and steal their way across a vast and rugged heart of America in order to survive. Coming Spring 2018 to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One systems. Can't wait. I can't either. So yeah, the Van der Linde gang is Dutch's gang. You remember Dutch's gang from the first one because that's the gang Marston was in, left. They all came after him at the end there. And then that all the way it ended, you get a younger version of Dutch.",

It's one of those right now. We know that it's the story of outlaw Arthur Morgan because one of the things that Rockstar has done narratively over the years, I think, is really interesting is they will surprise you. I remember L.A. Noire, you're like cut the two throws away through the game with something playing. Now you were playing a different character. And you know, Red Dead, you know, I guess spoilers if you're a boy now, man, it's later on, you know, the game does that weird kind of time, time travel brain where you're never again play son.

Very getting all the juice out of that berry, if you know what I'm saying. Do you, I mean, this is way too early to know, but you think these will be optimized for Pro and, oh yeah, 100%. You get the super 4K versions. Yeah, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's what the one that really pushed and maybe 10-15 years of PC version. And they said way because they are always very, very late. 20 years, you got a Switch version for some reason. Never. You're like, okay, that's somewhat happen.

I did order a One X. Okay. So that might be there because I'm interested in all the, I'm interested obviously in the Blu-rays and then the movies and, you know, when you go to the store, look at a 4K TV and I'd like the idea of playing games that are kind of closer to the experience I can have on my, your fully loaded PC but in the, in the live and on a, you know, nice easy-to-use system. The way games were meant to be played, you know, you never really been a PC guy, have never have been, never will be. All right. I'm sticking with consoles. So they're dead and it won't be long now.

Exactly. One of the things I find facings, you mentioned GTA Online. I didn't notice, I had discovered only recently is that GTA V has had this incredible tail end of a lot all the time expansions. If you empty one of the most perennially popular games online, I have online and yeah, just hugely popular. Sorry. I mean, how great would it be if the new Red Dead had a similar like expansion? The cattle-rustling expansion and the robbing a train. They just don't want it on forever. It's guy. I mean, Rockstar has found money hand-over-fist with that mode.

Yeah, I'm excited to see other new features and stuff that I'm looking for. I don't want to know. I don't, I don't, this is one of those ones you always kind of want to maintain the radio silence and just be surprised. Exactly. Exactly. I'll watch that. I will watch this trailer, but after that, I think I may go on blackout and just wait for the game. Well, that would be hope with the sprint, the run-up to spring, right?

Like they don't give away, you know, they don't do big surprises. Sure. You know, they keep it all under their hat until the last second. They always be very compelling, evocative trailers but without giving away too much. Yeah, this is certainly is what I want. I'm excited for you to see it. Next, Rusty writes into KindaFunny.com/KFGDD and says, yo, yo, yo. So the Red Dead trailer got me wondering, why does anyone make prequels? I honestly can't think of good one in games or movies.

Rogue One, a Star Wars. It was technically a prequel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was awesome. Loved it. It was great. I think most people loved it. Cool. Greg's, you lost a Rogue One. Yeah, she's cool. Yeah, thanks, mate. Why do you, why do people care about prequels?

You know, like for example, I personally as a fan might have preferred it if for the new Star Trek they had gone forward a generation instead of filling in more of the, you know, the pre-Next Generation timeline. Yeah, it doesn't mean that shows better or worse. It's just my personal taste. So I don't know, there's a hard and fast rule. I think you look at, you know, what is the most, what's those interesting part of the story to do next? Fill in a bit of backstory or go forward. Really depends on what the game is.

And then it seems like it's when you said prequel, I mean, Sleeman, why are they gonna do like young John Marston or something? We already touched on some of that in the last game. Yeah. So this, this feels like a prequel only in the sense that it's, it's the, the, the calendar year is, is lower. Yeah. It's more, it involves Dutch. So there'll be a crossover there.

January 18th, 9:00 p.m. Pacific time, our time in 2018, they'll cut it off. And that's basically a year since the release. It'll be January 19th, obviously, as you roll forward with time zones.

But what the dusty tokens are used for is unlike outfits in the game. So from today until the service ends, Sony has implemented a dusty token acquisition increase event, which will increase the amount of dusty tokens you can obtain by playing online, allowing you obtain the costumes, talent, a talisman and the other rewards that will no longer be available when the service ends.
