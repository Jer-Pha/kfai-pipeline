Hey, what's going on? Not much. I've been on the show in a while. True. Oh yeah, I know the PAX thing. It's been a... you've been around and you were here yesterday for the Destiny stream. Yeah, so it just feels like, you know, you're here all the time and happening these halls. Yeah, I noticed it's we've been doing this show long enough that I no longer have to think about your nickname beforehand leading into it, but now it's just there. It's second nature. Awesome. Nate, I can never remember. I got no short-term memory. What if I say stuff over? Don't beat yourself up. Thank you very much, Angie. Look at me, your problem now. For me, we're one day removed from the release of the official release of Destiny 2. Yep. How are you feeling? Pretty good. Yeah, yeah, overall liking what I've seen so far. Do have some gripes.

Not right after we eat lunch, but after this, we're gonna record a Kinda Funny Gamescast. You can pick it up live as we do it at Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames for a buck, or you can get it early on at YouTube, or not early on Patreon tomorrow as well, or free on YouTube on Monday. But it's all Destiny, so we're keeping a lot of the Destiny stuff. They are full, not full review, but full impressions so far. Did you go home and play more last night? I did.

I've been playing Destiny for a while and like the good thing about gorging and streaming all day is that I feel like when I get home, I can actually like spend time with her and not feel like I'm ignoring my video games. Yes. I was something you want, do you want to watch something together? She's like, she stopped Everybody's Golfing. She's like, yeah, she picked a Spawn, huh? The the Spawn movie. Wow. Back in the '90s, we watched and holy **** is that a bad movie? That is a bad film. Seems like a waste of time. It was fun and stupid to watch Martin Sheen being a bad guy, seeing how bad because I remember watching this movie when it came out and being like, oh, that's it.

So the the Fireteam that I was playing with, one of the people wasn't high enough level for us to continue the story stuff and he wasn't planning on hanging around for long anyway.

Oh, the South Park: The Fractured But Whole difficulty slider changes your city joke in and there's a bunch of gender stuff attached to it too. This is from Eurogamer. They have a video up about it, but their articles explains it all out. What's interesting is the easier the difficult people, lighter your character skin. Conversely, the harder the difficulty, the darker your character's skin. It means if you want to play The Fractured But Whole on a harder but then normal difficulty, you have to play as a person of color. During the process, South Park stalwart Eric Cartman will comment, quote, \"Don't worry, this doesn't affect combat, just every other aspect of your whole life.\" Eurogamer asked Ubisoft developers about this",

They were told the difficulty of the game affects the amount of money you receive and the way other characters speak to you throughout the course of the game. It is quite clearly a social commentary on racism and modern society and as far as video games go, a pretty effective one. Later in the game, The Fractured But Whole asks you to choose your characters gender. In conversation with South Park school counselor Mr. Mackey, you must choose from three options: male, female, and other. Improve you in the previous South Park game, Stick of Truth, you had to play as a boy. Your game Eurogamer picked female. Mr. Mackey hums and aahs before calling your parents who reinforced the decision. It turns out if you pick a non-male character, Ubisoft will use the conversation with Mr.",

You're then asked to select whether you identify a cisgender or transgender. Eurogamer picked up transgender and Mr. Mackey once again calls your parents, quote, \"It still tracks with the Stick of Truth. Yes, it does. She was definitely a girl the whole time. Yes, of course. I get it.\" End quote. **** brilliant. I'm very happy to hear this. I mean, and it's such a perfect fit for it.

And it's something that I know when I got to host the panel with Trey Parker and Matt Stone at Comic-Con for the original Stick of Truth, original software game, I should say, and talking to them like that was one of their concerns, right? Is that the show, of course, every scene, the documentary is done, it's completed, you know, moments before it actually has to be turned into Comedy Central.

What a great idea and bravo to Ubisoft for trusting them enough, let them take this leap. I'm sure there are plenty of publishers out there who would not allow them to take such a bold move because it could alienate, you know, certain people. People like to get upset about things very quickly these days. So hats off to both both of them. The only, I shouldn't say the only thing, I haven't dug around. I've read the article.

Oh, I mean, nothing that I haven't already said. Yeah, Jen the other day was super bummed in Everybody's Golf that she keeps unlocking all these new voices and then she goes to apply them to her character and they're not there.

This this actually gets me excited to play it twice or at least watch a video that somebody else is doing that'll explain the differences. Yes, I'd love to go through as the whitest of white people and the darkest of dark people and see what exactly happens there. Yeah, I wonder if the conversations are gonna be dramatically different.

So I'm gonna give you the bullet points and we'll get into the questions. November 14, 2017, you'll get this on Switch, PS4, Xbox One.

Brandon wrote in the KindaFunny.com/KFGd, just like you Canon says, \"L.A. Noire, who the hell asks for this? Not goddamn purse.\" A weird, weird hick. I can't get over the fact like when this came up, I think we even, you're on this show, right? Where we were, I can't imagine they do this. Why would they do this? All games in their library, why that one? The only thing I can figure, I really can't. I guess it's just that it's got to be, it had to be super easy.

It's, I mean, you Brandon and me and I think you to that of just being like, it wasn't that great. We really didn't love it. Like I think that's a lot of people, but I do know there's a lot of people love it. Yeah, just for for reference, the Metacritic rating for L.A. Noire on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is 89%. The complete edition on PC is 83%. So like it's scored well. My problem with the game wasn't that it was broken or that it was bad. I just didn't like it. Yeah, it just wasn't fun.

I think that's one that yeah, you get so swept up in the facial capture and it was different and it was an interesting idea, but interesting ideas don't necessarily make a memorable game, right? Like I feel like it's just like whatever. I will say even though I made the joke about falling asleep in VR, I I think that the type of detective work that you do in that game in the way that the mechanics are built into that detective work could lend itself pretty well to VR.

I was make fun of it where I remember this one time where they opened up the hotel ledger and I supposed to look for a name or whatever, like the incongruencies been the story.

Yeah, it had a really good flow to it in a way that sometimes, you know, in narrative based FPS games, the the shooting is either really great and the story suffers or the story is really great and the shooting suffers. And I felt like both of them excelled in Max Payne. What? See with that pitch, I'd play that one of you L.A. Noire. I don't have any interesting. No, don't go back to L.A. Noire.
