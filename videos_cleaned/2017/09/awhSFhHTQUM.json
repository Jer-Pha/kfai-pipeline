Okay, that may come into play in other episodes. We'll stand by. Show me up. Say, how good is Firehouse Chicken? It's really, really good. Yeah, what'd you like about it? The crispiness skin. Yeah, and then it's got a lot of kick to it. Yeah, the big part of the kick, of course, is the fact that it marinates at least overnight. Now, I say at least overnight 'cause you can go up to three days. However, you could also just do it like an hour and a half, which I did that one time, the first time you ever had it, which worked fine. Wait, see how potent it is. Now, it's gonna punch you in the face with food and flavor. So let's time travel back to yesterday when I started the marinade. So we're gonna make the marinade here in my Ninja blender. I don't know why I said a Ninja like they paid for the show. Actually, they didn't. I should have blocked this out and made them pay for it. Doesn't",

I should have blocked this out and made them pay for it. Doesn't matter. The point of telling you about the blender is that when I started doing this recipe a few years ago, I did not under any circumstance use a blender. Didn't have one, didn't use it. Just chopped it all by hand, put it into a bag, and it worked out just as well. So first off, we need to start four cloves of garlic. Got it here. Really get in there and get through all this stuff. I always overuse garlic, by the way. If you'll notice as you go through any four cloves, I'm gonna chop them up, but I'm gonna go for the big bad ones. And then I'm probably gonna go more like six, just because garlic's awesome. Isn't that right, Nick Scarpino? Yeah, boy. Thank you, boy. I'm not gonna smash them. I'm good at it, yeah. So we got these guys, right? Yeah, I'm a big six over here. Got all this junk. All right, you know what I'll do?",

Got all this junk. All right, you know what I'll do? Seven, 'cause I have seven broken them. I should give credit where credit's due. This is an old Bon App\u00e9tit recipe. I found it. My mom had an issue when I went home once. A Bon App\u00e9tit for some reason. And I'm sure Jaime will kill me. She was here hearing me say Bon App\u00e9tit. Border. It's because you put a lot of emphasis on the bone. I'm boning into. Maybe I'm boning, you're like, it's like you're talking about boning another human being. Sure, that's chopped pretty well. You know, forgetting us again, it's going in a blender. But I think you do this to express it. Like I said, you don't need the blender. Don't feel like this is something you have to have. I didn't have it for a long, long time. Now I do because Jen demanded she moved here. I might even bought it before she moved here, but then she only uses it for smoothies",

I might even bought it before she moved here, but then she only uses it for smoothies and stuff. And then I discovered, of course, a lot of my old recipes call for this. So I screwed that up. Next, we need to put in two cups distilled white vinegar. There's a brand new one. I have one over there that's limping along, but I didn't feel like doing like, oh, oh, this, this one's half done. You know what I mean, Nick? Nobody wants that. You want to jump right in there. I'm all set here. New measuring cups too. I bought a lot of cool for the show, mainly 'cause I get expensive too. Kinda Funny, don't tell Nick. So what, you had a perfectly good vinegar and you're like, man, I want to use that one. I'm gonna buy a brand new one. I will start with the measuring cups. But yeah, it's not perfectly good there. You know, I don't, I don't think there was a, I think maybe I had one cup in. I was gonna need more to come. You",

There you go. Now a big one here. \u00bc cup kosher salt. All right, what is it next? Oh yeah, my favorite, two tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley. Now parsley, same thing as ye old garlic, where I just use a lot of it. Tablespoons. I get sit here in my olden days when I was a young buck trying this recipe for the first time. Sure, I would sit there, pack it into the tablespoons, be like, is this right? Is that what it should be? Now, you know what I do, Nick? I just say, you know what? I love parsley and I like the colors it makes. I like how colorful it makes the marinade. I just, there's a handful of it, two handfuls even. That's enough for me. All of it in there. Is",

That's how, that's how I roll. That's how you should roll. What's next here on the list here from Bon App\u00e9tit? Now we're gonna put in two tablespoons of paprika. Now paprika, I will measure out. I want to know exactly if I'm putting enough in there with the brand new thing. Like I said, oh, Kinda Funny's picking up the bill. Everything. You know what I mean? It better not be like a new dog right around. Well, if we use it in the show though, it's all right off. So two tablespoons of the paprika in there. What else we missing? You know, they want us to do one tablespoon of the pepper and then a \u00bd cup of veggie oil. Are you asking yourself, is that a giant brand new thing of veggie oil? To",

You got it in there, half cup. Yeah, done. And that's it for that guy. So now the fun part, we're gonna blend it up. I use the pulse option. The pulse option, Nick. Okay, look at that beautiful coloring. You know what I mean? Yeah, you can see the flavors in there. That's what I love so much about it. So then you take your big old resealable bag. Top all this in there. Two breasts, bone-in, skin-on. Two thighs, bone-in, skin-on. Again, Bon App\u00e9tit. You know, the thing is, you're always dealing with the bone again, right? Yeah, take this marinade, just pour it on in there. Oh my God, the flavors, Nick. Sounds squishy. Yeah, that's the Firehouse Chicken in the bag, in the marinade. I'm gonna put it in",

Yeah, that's the Firehouse Chicken in the bag, in the marinade. I'm gonna put it in there overnight. Again, you could do it a long time ago. I'll flip it a few times as I do stuff throughout the day today. Again, I've done it with as little as like an hour and a half. Notice it gets it, but the longer you keep it in there, the more tasty it's gonna be. Marinated it overnight. Then the idea is to bring it out about an hour before it goes on into this guy to go on there. You want to bring it to room temperature. Where and put it out? Where to put on the plate? When to pat it dry? They were removing to making the Brussels Sprouts. Just like everything else in this Bon App\u00e9tit recipe. Like you don't listen to them. You know what I mean?

Approximate cooking though, is my favorite kind of cooking, right? Because that's all you cooking. As I say all the time on this show, it's, it's not as hard as people want it to be. You know, any sounds hard to make. Why do you love cooking, Genevi\u00e8ve? You're saying almost because it's great and it's very cathartic for me. It makes me forget about all the way like problems. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, they're out there now. I'm just gonna go in there. I don't want to pat too hard. I don't want to take away too much. What's this remind you? Yeah, don't cheat in here. Just like you came. Cooking's not as hard to do. We have just agreed. We bought Brussels Sprouts. Yeah, we were in a hurry. We've bought the Green Giant ones that were already washed and already cooked. So we're gonna do you cut, you clean them. Wait, yeah, you clean them, you destem them, peel off",

Wait, yeah, you clean them, you destem them, peel off any yellow leaves, and then cut him in half. So we've done that, right? Just toss them in this bag. Then if they get cut back, there you go. Thank you. Now they want three tablespoons. Revive them. I don't think you have to be like that. Approximate cooking. So now these will go in for a total of about 45 minutes. You want them nice and darker, crispy as you want them. I guess it'll caramelize. Exactly. Every 10 minutes or so, you should shake them, flip them a little bit, get them gone. I'm sure forget about it. Do it here and there. Put that in there. Show me a single weight. You're gonna make Farro for us. I mean, it's, it's like rice, but better.

Gosh, it's like, how long does it? Here's the thing. You, you make it, you, you joke. She jokes about how easy Farro was. I literally never cooked it. That's why I wanted her on this episode in particular now, because she's my Farro. Whoa. Just because I need to know how. I don't know how to cook Farro. So load of water and then you bring it to a boil. And then how long is the Farro gotta be in it? 20 minutes. Okay. All right. So you want to talk to people about what you discovered on how to do this? Because here's the thing. I've been making Firehouse Chicken so much longer than I've known Genevi\u00e8ve St-Onge.

And the problem with it is that you want the crispy skin on the other side. You want it to be nice and dark. Nobody wants a sad chicken night. Nobody wants a sad chicken at that. And so what I was doing is, you know, getting the nice and hot and put the first time I ever did, I put the oil in it. And then I put the chicken in it facedown. And then I came back when it was supposed to be and I pulled it out and it, the chicken skin to stick and hold off. So then every time I've done this or even the chorizo chicken thigh dishes, another cooking episode, I constantly moved them. Just sat there for the 15 minutes moving them around. And then you had a new plan that worked out really. Yeah. So what is it? So it's super, I guess it's very sciency and appropriate to the cast-iron pan.

And then you literally put the chicken skin down on it in the cold pan. I'm gonna dump it in here. Is to coat it. All right. Yeah, Nick, you see? Really? Yeah. Mmm. I couldn't way more last time. I'm making some kick ass two thighs and two chicken. I'm sorry. Mmm, two breasts. It needs to be boiling before, right, Genevi\u00e8ve? I want to do what you didn't want a nice. I don't approximate cooking. So we're gonna put it in there. We don't want to touch. No, that's the big thing. Show them the skin side. Like this one has shitty skin. The shitty skin. It's like old push back. We talked about this. Oh, you're right. Wait, isn't a skin at the front still? Can we try to fix it a little bit? Because otherwise we're not gonna get anything crispy.

I'm just getting some more blood flow to the skin, baby. Skin down, everybody. Yes, inside down to this part. So yeah, it's, it's admit, it may seem strange to start them off on a cold pan, but it works really nice. And I don't know why. I can't explain it. Well, I think it's just because they warm together, right? And there's like, there's a bond of brotherhood and they all went through this. The oil in the pan, the chicken was together.
