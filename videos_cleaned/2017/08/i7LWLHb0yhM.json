There's a lot of time stuff going on at the time of us recording this. There's an embargo on the Sonic Mania review, but I have not been more excited for a game than Sonic Mania in a very long time. Sure. So I want to at least have an initial discussion of this and when I say initial, I mean I've almost beat this game this morning. I died with what I imagine is the final boss. So I played a lot of it. Terrible. Get good. Yeah, I need to get good, but I just ran out of time this morning for it came in, but I wanted to give it at least my review of the game for people because at the end of the day, this is exactly what I said. Yeah, it is the best Sonic game. Wow. Wow. Hey, I really, really believe that. And again, I haven't beat it yet. I but it is just at the very end. I don't want to spoil anything.

I think the most important thing for me to let you guys know is if you're a Sonic fan at all, please avoid spoilers and just go in. There are so many fun moments, so many throwbacks, the balance between new and old levels. And even the old levels, none of them are exactly the same. In fact, they're all better than the originals. They're all reimagined and designed with modern gameplay in mind. Okay. Still the classic Sonic gameplay, but I just feel like there are so few moments playing through this game that I'm like, oh, this is frustrating because of the design. Whereas Sonic, I recently played through Sonic 1, 2, 3, CD, and Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Sure. Just to kind of like see where this one would fall. And I just think that like pound for pound, every level I'm playing, I'm just like, man, there was so much care put into every aspect of this game that they really, really, alright.",

And I love, we always talk about our players that we remember these games feeling like this takes that to another level because it looks exactly like it. It sounds exactly like it. And the sound is an interesting thing because this game isn't it on paper. It looks like, oh, what if Sonic had another game come out on the Genesis? But it's like, that's not what this is. This is what Sonic would have been had there been a 2D Sonic on the Sega Saturn. Mmm. Then the soundtrack, I think, has a lot to do with that where it's not the 16-bit Genesis sound font. It is this amazing soundtrack that makes you feel what you remember Sonic sounding like. And I love that because the music is Sonic's like one of the most important things to me as a huge fan of the game. Sure. The bosses are",

Sure. The bosses are so creative. The bosses, it's a hodgepodge of greatest hits of the original games and some really great new ones. I have very little criticism of the core gameplay. I think that towards the end, there are some design choices that I'm like, I feel like they're only doing this as a throwback to the shitty design choices of yesteryear. But I asked to make fun of it or as like, we have to get this in there for a while. I thought it was too like, I'm just parody and be like, remember when we had to do this ****? But then it kind of gets overused a little bit and it does add to the difficulty, but it adds to the frustration in a not fun way. Gotcha. So that was a little disappointing to me.

Sonic 3 kind of introduced that and this one really just ran home with it where there's just such so much life in the game. There's so much care put into everything that it's just like when I'm playing, I'm like, I feel respected as a Sonic fan, which is something I himself maybe my entire life. Yeah. I mean, for me, you know, as we always talk about a lifelong Sega fan, a born Sega fan, right? But someone who loved the Sonic on Genesis and stuff. Since I've been playing this at preview events, Judges Week stuff like that, it was the the fan service shining through even for me, right? And to your point, I don't spoil it, but you know, I'm talking about that boss battle. I came back from Judges Week. I was like, Tim, holy **** ****.

Mmhmm. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Played through that boss site. And even that, I passed by it alone is such a great. I miss the first boss fights in the second level.

I have never felt the way I do about this game from a video game with one exception, and that is Metal Gear Solid 4. Wow. When you go back to Shadow Moses, yeah, like there are moments going back to other random zones and stuff where I'm like, it felt like revisiting a place I hadn't seen in 10 years. Sure. Even hadn't having just played through those games recently. And I loved that like that that shows that there was care put into it.

I don't want you being good about spoilers. I'll be good too. But when you go through the first giant ring in the Act, you know, Act 1 of Green Hill Zone, right? And you pop out in another place to play on another thing, which I don't know if a cutscene or anything because I haven't followed this game closely. But that was just like, this makes me want to go play every level because I want to have these kind of experiences of jumping. They're going to be like, I don't know what the **** on the other end.

And then there's the the fan base that is the Adventure people. And then, you know, fan base is for the other stuff as well. But by and large, a lot of people camp. It's easy to **** on Sonic. There's the Sonic Cycle. And the Sonic Cycle has been broken. Generations broke it many moons ago. But when we got Sonic 4, I was so excited that it was going to be what I wanted and it totally wasn't. And then Episode 2 came out and was better, but it was not what I wanted.

Yeah, this is awesome because I really do believe it is better than those other games. Wow. Like I believe that it has better music than Sonic 2, which was my favorite soundtrack to the series. It is just better level design than Sonic 3, which definitely had the best level design of the franchise. And it has more levels. I feel like Sonic 1 did a really good job. The pacing was talking horrible, but it did a good job of having levels that were based purely on speed and momentum and the physics playground, the idea. And then there was levels there were a bit more slow paced and platform focused. And I the the pacing of how those levels played out in Sonic 1 was bad. Like Marble Zone being the second one like slowed things to a **** crawl. And that's why everyone is so critical of Sonic 1. And I you're trying to go",

And I think that this game does the best job where every level has both of those in some way where it's like when you're moving forward, you feel like you're you're doing it right. And there's that sense of adrenaline when it's still just a quick time event or whatever Sonic going through **** when you're excited to see what's on the other side. And the fact that the boss, there's a boss in every level, like whether it's a mini boss in Act 1 or a real boss in Act 2. And they're very creative with the bosses.

And it's like, it's just things like that that are so awesome. At the moment I heard, I'm like, wow, they did it. You know, like they really went out of their way to make sure that everyone involved in this game is the right person for the thing. Not even see in the competitive mode where it's it's squished and it looks just like it used to. It's like they really cared. And there's a lot of unlockable stuff that I still don't have yet.

Then I made a game called Boom Blox. Yeah. Want to be the best games on the Nintendo Wii. I love that. It was such a fun game to work on. And then I've been at EA for about four years at that time. And I decided to **** quit my job and blow up my life and go work on Journey. That's right. A California career. Journey. Yet. So I was executive producer of Journey, which means that I built the team and helped get everybody together and get the game out the door.

I never met you somehow earlier, not. Yeah, no, I think that's true. And no cut maybe in a passing something that I've never talked to you. Yeah.

It me and her just talking. I'm going to show you're amazing. Well, fine. Then we finally made it happen to have her come on the show because I remember back when Journey was happening. Yet, was it?

Don't you can keep your get a chicken dinner. No gives you go home with the trophy. And then we ended up up winning everything. It was crazy. Yes. Did you want to be nice as well? We won.

Like, you know, best online experience against a game that cost like can a hundred times what Journey cost to makes. Yeah. It was really kind of one of those moments that never happens in the life of a developer. And we were all just kind of like, alright, well, now what? So here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen, this Gamescast is all types of messed up and it's not going to be the standard format because there's some embargo stuff and things are all moved around and whatnot.

This morning, I was sipping some water out of my favorite mug, which is a fan-made ceramic mug with a Journey, you know, character on it and two gravestones and a scarf flying in the wind. And I was thinking about like just how when I when I started working on the game, we had a lot of different ideas about what we thought it might be. We thought it might be a multiplayer game, like a massively multiplayer game. It might be a bunch of people taking a pilgrimage to a far-off place. And then the more refined the game got and the simpler it got, I think right around this time, it was about five years ago that we shipped the game.

Everyone's going to say it's just it's too basic, it's too simple. But we had had such ambitious ideas and it had gotten down to such in sort of a very classic and streamlined form that it felt to me almost like it was too easy. Like it just every little piece that together. And I felt like, well, it's so simple. I just don't know. And then when it went out, everybody was like, it's perfect. And so I think that it I'm thinking right now a lot about Luna and getting it done. And this feeling of like, simple is good. You know, you don't have to put every single thing that you thought of into the game. And it's probably better if you don't. And to just really",

Not such a fan of the anxiety, but it's not going to work. Go. And I think that that's like, I'm remembering that feeling going, okay, this is normal. Does okay. Everything is unfolding exactly as I expected. Totally okay with his feeling, which is kind of like both excited and totally **** terrified. Sure. Or did you work on Flower at all? Did you come?

Yeah, I mean, whatever. And no, I mean, I don't like a lot of games. A lot of games come out and I play them and I'm like, you know, that's the thing with with Battlegrounds. So yeah, you know, with PlayerUnknown, like that game has a cool series of mechanics that make it interesting to shoot people. Like most games should you shoot people are not that interesting to me as a game designer because I've played them. I, you know, I used to do",

I, you know, I used to do Halo LAN parties when you have to like put all the Xboxes together in one room. You know, I love that ****. But after a while, it's like as a game designer, I'm always looking for the new thing. So I get inspired by sculpture or reading a book or going to a film or like Sleep No More, stuff like that. That's what gives me new ideas. And playing like a kind of standard, you know, franchise extension or doing this or doing that, it's not going to give me a lot of new ideas. However, there was something that just came it recently. It was also this was Dave lying daling as a guy was watching a stream PUBG. So sorry you had to hang out, Dave. I'm sorry. I know he was a funny man. And we were talking about it. And one of the things that's true is that games like as they get into later and later into",

So in some cases, a game is it like, it's like 5th or 8th or 10th, you know, release, but it gets so good at like being Hitman or whatever. And I think that's actually something that is kind of unsung in the industry, you know, from, you know, at the level of game designers. There's something really great about working on something that's got such a legacy and being able to like you say, basically like go back to Metroid. Mm-hmm. What we do, what, what do we really do to make this an enjoyable experience for everybody and to kind of, you know, smooth over some of those bumps.

Yeah, for this week in gaming history. 2 years ago. Yeah, this one's for you, Greg. Thank you. I don't know that way if we're in like that. I feel like if we're 8 years to 2 years, it's going to be something good, something for Greg and we can weigh in a Nintendo ****. I don't understand. Yeah, usually how it goes. 2 years ago, in August 6th, 2015, Gal*Gun Double Peace came out. PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita. It's definitely a 1 million with this game.

I was the next 7 years ago, in August 10, 2010, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game on PlayStation 3. You guys have any memories of that guy? Oh man, Scott Pilgrim. Well, I mean, like I read all the comic books. Did you play the game? No, I didn't play the game. I just, I remember reading the comics. Yeah, we, oh yeah, that was another one that everybody did, GM loves. So UB would bring it over all the time to do like Let's Plays or whatever when we'd all play. It was great. And then it was like, wait, there's no online play because that's what like you talk about like a moment in time that was still part of the time where we're like, we love these kind of games.

We, we've had long enough where we missed that part of our childhood, our game. Yeah. And so that was one of those. Yeah, it was great. It was awesome. And we played it a lot in the office. And then when it finally came up, how many people went home and played it with each other? Yeah, now I look forward to it so much. Loved the comics, loved the movie. So for the game, like, of course, this is, I'm all about this. I feel like from a presentation standpoint, they did such a good job. They introduced me to Anamanaguchi that I love them now.

It's just like, there's not much today. What about Viewtiful Joe? Have you gone back inside Ellen? Do you know that one was a badass game? It totally. But that there's a lot more game to that than hands. We're just kind of just go and his punch, punch or throw. Yeah. And that's kind of it. And you're just basing waves and waves of the same.

You can throw in Mad Maestro 2 if you really want to go there. I'm in like, that's like just, you know, now what I'd like to point out what you guys, I'm not saying you're wrong necessarily, even though you clearly are, is that I unlocked the feeling the Doki Doki trophy and Gal*Gun Double Peace on July 6, 2016.

But the thing about Scott Pilgrim is I was just kind of hitting on it for saying, but the boss fights I did really enjoy. And I thought that they kind of in and again, even though Turtles and Simpsons and all that did a great job with that with boss fights as well. But I feel like for game coming out in 2010, it did a great job. But it was really damn hard. It was brutally hard. And I, I felt like I needed multiple people to play with me because a single player, I never beat it. And here's some fun facts for you. I'm for 30th. Mm-hmm. I mean, we thought it's a not fun facts.

Ah, December 30th, 2014, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game and its DLC were delisted from the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network possibly due to license expiring. They don't really know why. However, the game is technically still available should one find a download code due to their inability to expire. That's great. And then on August 10, 2016, so last year, 6 years ago, after the game's initial launch, Scott Pilgrim creator Bryan Lee O'Malley created a post on Twitter stating that his number one goal in life is to get Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game re-released. That's all. Oh, there's a hope. I feel like he can make that happen. Yeah, we're just remaking with something. He's a super nice guy. Set a table with him at a wedding and he was really, really cool.

It's not going to be done. We'll do that. Uh, 9 years ago, on August 7, 2008, Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon. Oh, that's a great game. Nintendo DS. It is a great game, but I had some issues with it. Oh, I know. So here's my thing. It was uh, my handheld Fire Emblem that I played. This was, if you don't know, a remake of the first Fire Emblem game on the NES.
