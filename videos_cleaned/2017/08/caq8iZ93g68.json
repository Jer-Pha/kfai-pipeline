I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the Hispanic heartthrob, Andy Cortez. I've been told not to call me Hispanic because I am Mexican. I'm not from Spain, okay? Why do you feel we got that name Hispanic? I was at a Ubisoft party and one of the PR dudes there is a Kinda Funny fan. He's like, \"You be called like Latino something or like Latino.\" I can't say Latino Heat, can I? I mean, I can't take it away from, I can't take it away from Eddie. Yeah, you're right.

Barbecue the whole thing is low and slow, right? Low heat, slow. Okay. So you go to any high-end restaurant, any especially steak restaurant, you say, \"Are you doing Sous Vide or infrared broiler?\" And they go, \"Doing.\" There's only been one restaurant in the last year that I've gone to. I was like, \"Apple.\" And it was a steak joint in Chicago. Oh, yeah. And they, man, I know you know this place. It's one of those places been there for freaking ever.

You can't do that. So they'll have big tubs or they have an infrared broiler just constantly going through. And it's, what's an infrared bro? I'm not sure. Infrared broiler is most grills have an infrared broiler, okay? Um, super high heat, but it's, it's, uh, instead of using like flame, it's using infrared as the source of heat and so it cooks more accurately, okay?
