Was Tim? Oh, good. You got to knock that off. I'll be able to do the register over there. Bien, bien. R1. Tim Gettys, lovely. Mostly before we go any further, hey folks, from the FTC, PlayStation sent us these copies of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy to review. So there you go. It's part of PlayStation social media guidelines. Don't worry about it, guys. We do await it. Be let me be let me. So let me hear your buddy. Yeah, you feel me? Your brother already did this joke. All right, just get a tasket. I don't tape it that way. Tom at M&M right now business. Ah, so if you've never watched the Kinda Funny Reacts, we're going to be, it's a spoiler-free review now.

So I really feel like other than talking about gameplay mechanics and things like that, you're going to be okay even if you watch this whole thing. So I don't know if there's a real need for spoilers. No spoilers, but to dance around it just in case, let's start at the top. No spoilers, Tim, what did you think of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy? I thought it was really good. Yeah, it's really great. Okay, okay. Um, I feel like it is the middle six hours of an Uncharted game. Okay, which is a great thing. Sure, but it never has the highs, yeah, of the end, and it doesn't have the build-up and setup of the beginning. Sure, so it kind of feels a little disjointed and it feels like it never quite never quite you get it never gets quite where it's trying to go, never hit this drive.

Yeah, I thought it's like, I think it's better than most games out there, but I think when we think of Uncharted, it's just really highly regarded video game franchise and I think it's Tim and I were talking about the essay, probably the worst Uncharted. Okay, but it's still really, really good. Are you saying it's bad? No, no, I think it's really, really good. I just think that, uh, there were time drawers playing it thinking like, I don't know if I really care about this game right a whole lot. And then I would hit moments that really kind of, you know, the method is, yeah, there was some really cool dramatic moments between the characters and I enjoyed that stuff. But I think this isn't a really good game for clarification on that. Um, yes, sir, we were talking. I had only played maybe elbow point Rekha, um, and I still think",

Okay, and I would say that it's, I didn't think it's pretty up there with Uncharted 1. Okay, um, this is fascinating. You know, usually when we do a review like this, we've talked if it's a movie on the car ride home or just a little bit in the office about it. We haven't talked about, I haven't talked to you guys since it, you and I talked in our early early hours, but since we all be - really in general, I haven't talked about it. You're all at going exactly what I feel when I was in the shower today thinking about when we got to this point of doing this review, what I wanted to lead with was the fact of this is a really great game.

And I was trying to put that in a perspective of why, right? You and I briefly talked about it getting to those first few monster closets, so the first waves of guys and shooting people running around and breaking necks. It's like, this is what Uncharted is. This feels great. It's, I remember how I love this. I have missed this. I'm enjoying it so much. The vibrancy of the world they're exploring in India and doing all these different places, the characters you're dealing with in like, it's funny and as good as the dialogue is between Chloe and Nadine and all those different things, the prop you, but that's all great and it's all there and if you like Uncharted, you're going to",

It was, it was good, but it's, it's just, I don't know if we needed it exactly. And that, and that was the thing. And I, and I, this is like there though, it's interesting because earlier when I read you guys what we couldn't talk about in this review, right? You're all, oh, and I was like, for me, none of my conversation really is around this points. There are for me in this game, it took me according to game clock about seven and a half hours. Do you guys pay attention to years? I was around an eight and something. I think it said like ten overall. And then the stat below it says how much time did you spend idle not moving?

Okay, the thing about it for me when I was going through what it spoiled it, right? Is the fact that there's only three major set pieces that stood out where I was like, oh, that's something different. And what's what rank so loud playing this for me, and this isn't a bad thing, I'm not trying to make it sound like this is horrible, but it was, oh, this is Uncharted 4 again. Like, you know, the reason I have notes, right? Is the fact of, all right, cool, you're there weren't, there was no Uncharted: The Lost Legacy core game mechanic. Nothing about this game that is just like, oh man, this section, yeah, is what this game is going to be remembered. There's no cruise ship, there's no",

All right, now I'm sliding on **** as I go down stuff. All right, now that armored vehicle's back that need to fine. All right, now I'm driving a Jeep and chasing something. All right, now I'm driving a Jeep and jumping from cookie. It's like, these are all cool moments that I loved in Uncharted 4, but when we got to this point, which I knew is a slippery slope of we've been working on this DLC, but it's bigger than a DLC, so it's it's own thing now.

I think maybe, and maybe it's just me, and I know that I've been saying on the show, the morning show, and then get Kinda Funny's Alien Games cast of like, people were sleeping on this. Maybe I was just over hyping it based on what I was getting told was going to happen, what I saw. I mean, it's interesting because all those points you're making are absolutely true. I just feel at the end of the day, this game is worth $40. Okay, I know I might be away from it even, even it being just Uncharted 4 mechanics again.

It treats you as if you've played Uncharted 4 and all the the people that made this game have obviously listened to the reviews of Uncharted 4 because they kind of have what snarky remarks against all the criticism of the rope or of using those two crates to do things or the classic Uncharted Last of Us. Okay, the car goes up and kick your bladder down and all that stuff. Every time there's one of those mechanics, they do make a reference whether it's the Jeep or hanging off the Jeep or the slippery slopes. They make some comment that it's kind of like tongue-in-cheek of we we get that we're just doing a and we are going to switch it up a little bit or the winch. Oh, the winch.

And then they'll do it. So I enjoy that. The crates, there's a similar thing or it's like, you do it once and then the second time it fails like, you know what, I can use crates anymore. And I'm like, cool, they're respecting us in that way. And I enjoyed those little nods. But I enjoy them too, but I think this is what all funnels back into and I hate saying it, but it being the less of all the Naughty Dog Uncharted. You know what I mean?

It is, you know, on the thing, but I don't count it in terms of this argument because this is not at all good all these Naughty Dog ones. It's just the fact that yeah, like it's great and it's solid and it's fun and it reminded me of why I liked Uncharted, but when I got to the end and like I'm talking about the final scenes before I, I really liked the entire final sequence.

Hmm, Uncharted 4's ending was so **** perfect and solid. And if they wanted to come back and tell us a new story and do it with new characters and like have a new Uncharted, new trilogy or whatever, awesome. But the way that like this is the last touch of Uncharted I'm going to get are years. You assume, I mean, I'm not sure that's true though. I mean, I know that they've said things, but I if this game does well and with the way that it ends and how it's presented, I don't know, we can get more things similar to this. But do you want that?

If they were to analyze Uncharted, this is what it would be where we're not seeing them push it in the new at new ways, right? And again, three major set pieces. I was like, oh, that was really cool. I didn't see that happen. It reminded me a lot of in The Last of Us when Joel is hurt and you were playing his la, that's what it reminded me of like, play you're playing as different characters in a very, very similar-looking world and you can tell that this didn't have the budget of Uncharted 4 where like, you have essentially one major biome or in part for you running all across the world and all this ****, but they were",

I don't think her character was very, very cool at all. I loved Chloe's writing. There was a lot of cool moments between both Drake. Yeah, it's a day after day. They made her deal with Sully without the Sully-ism. Yeah, yeah, see, I wouldn't go that far because my peers, my, I think overall performance wise, everything games great. I think it performance wise, definitely blacks great. Laura Bailey's great. Asav, who's the main villain, anywho, I'm not sure who plays him, great, grace. But in it, I'm with you in the fact that, and I'm surprised I am because coming into it at when we played Uncharted 4, I think it was you and Colin, we're both just like, I don't like Nadine at all.

Whoo, whoo, you are in this world. But like Nadine, they kind of tacked something on do, but I feel like it is a stick and then as I feel as we go through her motivations don't even make 100% sense. They don't. And it's interesting because I did not like Nadine at all and I was complaining to you about that when we first were playing, but I feel like as the game goes, as more things happen, it reached a point where am I, are you know what, I don't hate it.

It felt like Uncharted. It didn't feel like a substitute for Uncharted. And I think that's really important. And again, like what I was saying is it just feels like the middle of an Uncharted game. Earlier you're saying like, oh, it doesn't feel like it's as good as the other ones. I think that it is just as good as any of the middles of all Uncharted games.

But this is one of those interesting situations where we could avoid it because no one was really talking about. Yeah, but it was out. Yeah, yeah. So it's like, oh, we didn't go to preview events and I didn't really know anything. I wasn't surprised and that sucks. Yeah, like because it was just the same set pieces again.

Yeah, um, it started off at such a pace out like, ooh, mana, this does not look good. And then eventually picked up. Yeah, I agree. If you were, it started off and look, okay, false sense of security. And then by the time they bring up the logo, I was like, oh, this is a bit much slower entrance intro than I thought it was going to be. I think part of that is, you know, it's not, I think correct me if I'm wrong, it's it is, yeah, we're starting what was the PSX demo Rex, but that's where differences. Yeah, hood exactly.

What I can remember that was before after that's before. Yeah, yeah. I do think some of the sequences went on way too long. I think that that was a way for them to sort of get more play time out of the game and to point where my girlfriend looks at me and towards the end of one of the parts, she was like, man, this has been going for a long time. Yeah, like it's, it just kept going and I to the point where I did get kind of bored of it, um, and that was kind of unfortunate. Sure, there's the main chunk of this game is a open-world area. We they talked about this. Yeah, what the Western Ghats section. That's the more open world, the most open world things a while in style.

But that's the thing to write where it's like, I understand that this is bigger and more open than what they've done before, but it's still very much is that section that I've charted for where I drove around Madagascar, knocked over little things or rocks. Yeah, and even then I could go a little bit off track and do my own thing. And like for here, the one thing they do, and I did either of you do it where you got all the tokens, all 11 tokens? No, **** no. I did because I love open-world collectathon, especially when because when you're going through right in the open world thing that is what a",

You get a the map, you open it up, it's got the marks for what you have to go do to activate the next thing to go to the next thing. But as you, I was going, I started running into these little statues and then you find these tokens. So it's like, okay, these are clearly collectible. I wonder how many they have. All eventually you go to this one section and if you go to the other thing, you put your tokens and it's like, oh, there's 11. It looks like you mark them all on your map and you again. Yeah, I went and got them. And this is one of the things the game does add that's really **** cool. I think is a old school. I played every Uncharted and love them and platinum all.

So it's like hot cold game of which I was like, holy ****, it's been, it took four years or whatever, but I'm finally using the light bar for something any closer farther away.

Yeah, I have never seen her eyes into it while she was doing her own thing, but then she kept asking me questions. And then there was like a day that went by and she was also what's made eating Chloe up to him like, yeah, this is weird. Yeah, and you actually care. So I mean, that's what shout out to Naughty Dog. Like, they can really present a game in a way that is accessible and cinematic. I felt so bad for Jen because she was watch, she wanted to watch it while I played it and eventually she going to be like, I got to stop. I'm like, why? She's like, you're looking for all these",

Yeah, I'm like, dog, this is just games. How I just feel a bit, uh, sorry, I was just going to say most of my time playing the games probably in photo mode. God, they've done so much like photo mode obviously in Uncharted 4. They've added more stuff. There's more poster or poses, gestures, facial, yeah, and like filters. The facial gestures stuff is really, really cool. Do they have change the time of day in Uncharted 4?

The shooting sucks. **** the shooting. Fun the shitty movement and get them. You're all much a mom. Everyone get them weirder here first.

Sorry, a lot of you go but now we spoil it for you when when you sign off. I'll tell you all four of the things that really ruin the game for you. They're really cool.
