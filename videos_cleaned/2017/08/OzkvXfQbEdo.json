Tim, what's your topic? My topic is a very sad topic. It is a big departure from what we were just talking about, but I want to talk about Chester Bennington, the lead singer of Linkin Park, who died last week. Uh, killed himself. He was found dead in his home on Thursday. Uh, he by suicide by hanging. Uh, Bennington leaves behind six children from two marriages. He struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and previously talked about suicide as the result of childhood trauma and abuse. The news of his death came on the same day that the band debuted a new music video for their latest single off the new album that just came out. Uh, today as recording this, Linkin Park put out",

The shockwave of grief and denial are still sweeping through our families as we come to grips with what has happened. You touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized. In the past few days, we've seen an outpouring of love and support, both public and private, from around the world. To Talinda and the family, appreciate it and want the world to know that you are the best husband, son, and father. The family will never be whole without you.

Our love for making and performing music is inextinguishable. While we don't know what path our future may take, we know that each of our lives was made better by you. Thank you for that gift. We love you and miss you so much.

I guess my topic is celebrity deaths and how they affect you and if you've ever been affected by one or about them differently. I feel like we talked about this before with Robin Williams, I think was the last time that this came up. But, you know, having it like dealing with this, uh, this weekend, it it really made me realize like how much this affected me. And it's like I wouldn't necessarily think it does. I was a huge Linkin Park Fan. I mean, I would still say I am a huge Linkin Park Fan. Um, but of course, it's the same story so many people have that I grew up with them. Linkin Park was my first, uh, the first artist that I chose to listen to. You know, it wasn't my mom and dad listening to Rolling Stones, it or like the radio playing or Disney Channel, whatever, and Britney",

I like this.\" And, uh, I was so into it. And then as I up with it, and once Reanimation came out, that is what really introduced me to underground hip-hop and all that. And it really shaped the music I listen to now and who I am today and all that. So Linkin Park's very important to me. Uh, but then yeah, they grew up and they kept doing, they went different direction than I necessarily liked musically. And I'd keep coming back every once in a while, but it's undeniable the impact that they have had on me and how well I know. It's like this is a band that I can name the the people in the group.

It's just like so overwhelming where you just it there's so many emotions where I'm like, \"How could this happen?\" You know, it just feels so wrong that anybody would want to take their life like this. But it feels even more real that it's somebody that I think a lot of people look up to in that way. And I don't know, like, have you guys like, do you have any relationship to Linkin Park at all? Not me. No. Sure, of course. I mean, I I'm familiar with the band. I'm familiar with some of their hits. But to me, they were never something that I was.

Like, \"Cry!\" Like everyone knew all the words that entire **** thing. And so like that was my connection to them, right? It's like I I it's funny when I remember we bring up so many things on the show all the time that either were too old for, you're too young for. And when Linkin Park came up once, I was like, \"Oh, there's no.\" The first time years ago, I was like, \"Oh, you guys won't know who they are.\" And you like, \"Oh, no, I have all these memories and all these.\" And it's like, it's weird because that debut album was, I think, it for me.

And I'm sure maybe on the follow-up album there was something that I enjoyed or whatever. Meteora, their second. I mean, Hybrid Theory is of course the the one that everybody knows. I that had \"Crawling,\" that had \"In the End,\" that had \"One Step Closer.\" Yeah. Uh, but then Meteora is really when they like hit on the mainstream level of just like, \"Oh, ****! They did it again. They're not a one-trick pony.\" Yeah. Um, and they kind of perfected that new metal sound. And almost every single song on the second album was a single, like a top 10 successful single. Um, \"Faint,\" \"Somewhere I Belong,\" uh, \"Breaking the Habit\" is the biggest one. \"Numb.\" Um, if you heard them, you would definitely definitely give me a few bars. Come on.

I'll pick up if I know it. Well, then then eventually like they also did the the Jay-Z crossover with a Collision Course. And a lot of the songs on that were from Meteora as well. Um, but yeah, those two albums were probably the most important. I mean, they are the most important Linkin Park albums. Yeah. Um, and in between them was Reanimation, which was the remix album. Okay. And then it wasn't until in 2007, I want to say, they put out, um, happened here, uh, Minutes to Midnight. And that was the moment where they grew up. And it was there was only like two rap verses on the whole album. And it was a lot more rock. That was one, uh, when Transformers came out and they did the \"What I've Done,\" which was the Transformers theme song, uh, for the first movie. They did the the theme song for like three of the movies. One of those that to me like after I they",

And then exactly, you'd run like, no, everything they've done has actually been successful in this. And I mean, one, two, three, four, five, six, there's been seven albums. And that's not including their live albums. That's not including the the remix albums that happened in between. And every album has had hits. Every album has had songs that defined a group of teenagers growing up. You know, and I think that that's what's important about this band. Uh, recently, Roger Poore put out a video talking about how Linkin Park is this generation's U2. And in the video, he makes it very clear. He's like, he's not talking sonically. He's not talking about the sound of the music or whatever. He's talking about how",

He's talking about how they've changed and adapted in what they mean to so many different generations of kids growing up. And it's just it's heartbreaking that and Linkin Park says it in this letter, but that so much of their music, I mean, Linkin Park is hand in hand when people think of rap rock, but it's also hand in hand when people think of things like Hot Topic and when people think of things like, uh, just emo. Define sort of an era, which I don't know if I'm getting the dates right, but I mean, like late 90s to mid 2000s, like that style of everything is Linkin Park in a nutshell to me. Hybrid Theory, the first album, came out in 2000 as Linkin Park. And that was when Chester was with them. Before then, they were called Xero. And that they were way more rap focused at that point. Got. Yeah. So I mean, to me, like I remember",

It's not my favorite type of music, which I know is hilarious, 'cause every time we used to bring this up, people like, \"But you're a huge fan of Rage Against the Machine.\" And it's pretty much the exact same style. I'm like, \"No, they have deeper funk roots.\" But, um, but yeah, but but they literally, I mean, like it's undeniable that when you think of that era of music and pop culture, they helped define that for sure. And I think one of the reasons why I didn't like them was because it was such a departure from what I was used to. Like I was never, uh, hugely into rap. Um, and so to hear to have them, I guess that's not that's not fair to say. I guess I I liked rap. I liked rock. But to hear that fusion of the styles, I think there's just some part that was like, \"Ah, I don't\"",

I can't I can't deal with this.\" But the fact that so like they had such a big impact on pop culture means that there was it was resonating with a lot of people. Yeah, it definitely did. And to go even further with it, like just we're talking about Linkin Park, uh, not just Chester, like Mike Shinoda specifically. I think to me it was so it helped me out. Sidebar, Mike Shinoda. I don't know. I I knew that name from hanging out with you in connection to Linkin Park. Mike Shinoda, what does he do with Linkin Park? Mike Shinoda, 'cause I would have told if you would have said like, \"Oh,\" I would have been like, \"Oh, he's lead singer,\" because Tim always talks about him and I know his name. Yeah, he is.

The so they're both they're both the lead singers, but Chester is the lead singer. Shinoda's the lead rapper. Nowadays, everyone does a little bit of everything. So then, okay, so then in Chester would be, \"I felt this way before.\" So yeah, yeah, exactly. And that's Shinoda. Nope, those are like Chester. Sometimes I don't know how it doesn't really happen. That's that's the words are wrong. But exactly. But that's Mike Shinoda. But Mike Shinoda made it made rap accessible to to a whole different group of people. And I think that it really influenced the that again, like I was saying, the underground rap sound and like white people rap really is what it is. It is. And that kind of like eases people into then getting into to real rap or whatever the ****. Right? I'm using a lot of terms going to offend a lot of people, but it is what the **** it is.

What a bunch of, you know what I mean?\" Like that's so not that's not how this works. And then when Linkin Park comes around, everybody's rapping. Everybody's WPS. That's what's interesting to me about it though, is because it's not like it was talking about my experience. The fact that they were just rapping about feelings and singing about feelings. But really for me, it was the gateway drug. Was the rap part of it. Was rapping about feelings where I'm like, even though I don't share these feelings, I feel like this is real.

You know, sure. And it got me into a thing and put me in a head space that I'd never been in before. And to me, that really made me love all of what they did, not just the rap stuff that originally kind of got me into it. And the the the next level of it though, is that Chester, his voice is going to go down in history as one of the most identifiable singers of all time. Like he owns the screaming, but it's still music, right? 'Cause so many so many metal bands and stuff, it's just **** screaming. And we could hear this and be like, \"Oh my God, I don't like this.\" The way Chester did it was it sounded beautiful even when it was",

I Freddie Mercury owns the screaming with like that is different though. He was sing like there's a different thing there. There's a different vibe. I don't know. Like it doesn't matter. Let's let's move on. But I mean, you're right though. Freddie M has some like just like not like yells or like tones that he hits that like, \"Oh my God,\" are incredible. But what you're saying is is exactly what my point is, which is no, I would put Freddie Mercury and and Chester on the same level of what they did is wholly unique. You can't say someone else does that. Fair. I think it's fair point.

It makes me think in a much smaller way, like what if one of us were to die? Like what would that do to our community? You know? And I think that it's like obviously that's a much smaller scale.

Yeah. And it's same with Robin Williams. Like a lot of people, you remember Robin Williams, um, as the Genie in Aladdin and as this guy that everyone was there. But I mean, a lot of people remember him from the late 70s, early 80s, where he was running around spastically on stage on cocaine and like **** crazy. Right?

I don't want this.\" Like, \"Do do what you used to.\" And granted, Linkin Park, I think it's even more extreme because there's so many people, um, that grew up in my era of listening where whatever age they were, but like listening to Hybrid Theory",
