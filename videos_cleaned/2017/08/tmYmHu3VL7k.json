And let me tell you, I am damn excited for that because well, just because it's been a long time since we've we've had classic 2D Sonic. And man, Sonic Mania, I just feel like they're really going to knock it out of the park. Every they just every like week I think they've been releasing another song from the game, right?

You're saying that now? I'm saying it now. Best of all. I really think it's going to be I think and it's not even going to be close. Do you think that it's going to rate well with critics as well?

Persona 5: Dancing Star Night on the PlayStation 4 and the PS Vita Japan spring 2018 as well. And then Persona Q, for the 3DS.

That sucks. Yeah. I mean, my hope here would be like because you're talking about Nintendo core games. Persona Q, not not a Nintendo game. Nintendo's not publishing that. This is Atlus/Sega depending on, you know. Yeah. I mean, that's a valid point, but I still think that if we're going to get a Persona game on the Switch, I think it's either going to be a Switch version of Q, like a new like spin-off, but it is kind of a real game, but it's not a numbered core tile. uh either that for the Switch or it will be a Persona 5 remastered whatever I don't know",

Well, Chris Leon writes in and says, \"Hey guys, with the announcement of the dancing all night games for Persona 3 and Persona 5, do you think this could give hope to some type of re-release of Persona 3? I never got to play it since I only hopped on the train hype train with Persona 4 Golden. I would even settle for a PS2 to PS4 version with trophies. Just wanted to hear your thoughts. loving the new show. Keep up the great work, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Uh, I want to say yes, I love Persona 3.

But I mean, here's the thing. And you look at this and it's like they obviously are still looking back at three because coming out with the when there's the dancing games they did four. The fact that they're doing five and three. Yeah. Three is still in their mind. Three is still valuable to them and something they want to invest time into. Will we get a golden type of PS? But I don't think so because wasn't Persona 3 also on PSP? Yeah. But it was and it was but it was like you know it was another definitive edition, FES edition, but like it was one of those that was criminally underplayed cuz it added in a feature you could be a female protagonist if you wanted.

This is where it gets a little murky in terms of like America versus Japan. In Japan, Persona's been a big deal forever. And so for me, like, you know, I love the cast of Persona 3. Some some people do. I don't think enough people in America or the West know about it. Right. In Japan, that's not a problem. The fact that Persona Q had the Persona 3 cast in it, there's an audience that knows them that way. Do they think they need to look back that far? Or is it just the name Persona is so big now that nobody really cares if they Oh, I don't have any experience with Persona 3 cast, so I'm not going to play the dancing game.

I would lose my mind if they were like, \"Hey, we're doing a Persona 3 Golden and we're putting it out on PlayStation 4 and Switch and everything else mobile.\" But I mean, isn't the Persona 3 Golden just Persona 3 FES or whatever you said? Like what what is the difference between I'm talking like you know well like HD graphics and this that what they did with Persona 4 Golden where they they brought everything up and they you know they re-up it's not just a straight port if they're going to straight port it.

Super Mario Odyssey is rated E10+. This is all this broke via GoNintendo. As they point out, as far as we can tell, this is the first mainline Mario entry to get an E10+ rating from the ESRB. There are some other titles starring Mario that have gotten the rating before, like some of the Mario & Sonic games. I'm thinking that New Donk City portion might play into the game's rating since it features human lifelike humans you can jump on. IGN chimes in. According to the ESRB's rating guide, then E10+ is likely to contain quote more cartoon fantasy or mild violence, mild language, and/or minimal suggestive themes than your garden variety. E.

It contains more cartoon fantasy or violence. The difference between an E and an E10+ is the word more. So, I don't know what does that mean for Mario. I think it's a really good um idea that it's because of the New Donk City portion. Like the fact that it is humanlike people makes it less cartoony even though it's cartoon people, right?

Not drastically, but it would have an effect. Whereas the E10+, I'm like, \"Did you make that up just for this game?\" No, no, no. It's been around for a while. Remember before there there was that the K-A was the kids to adults. Yeah. Like a long long time ago. I nailed it, but I left out early childhood. There's an EC that you never see on any game.

I don't think that that's a good thing. However, it does sell a lot of copies easily.

We've talked a lot about the gameplay of Insomniac Spider-Man but what I want to know is this. What do you guys want out of the story of the game? I'd love to see some good storytelling that I that I feel like the Arkham games never really tried to do. They were definitely more concerned about the gameplay and just having a cool Batman story.

Um I think what he's talking about about the Arkham games being a cool Batman game I think this is going to be a cool Spider-Man game. Um I think this the story it it'll be fine. It could even be great but it's not going to be one of the best Spider-Man stories ever.

When he's getting around the city it happens a specific way. Us as players being able to have a more open world and do whatever we want slows the pace down. So I think that emotional story is going to be a lot harder to get across which is why I think they're going to do a really good job of every time we've heer focused. Yeah.

When I'm in the zone, I feel like I am on the battlefield alongside my eyeball compatriots wildly banging on drums, and they are asking me to break the immersion by throwing them my beats. Second, the bosses have no health bar, so how can I know if it's under 5%. That is a small window to hit. I must have tried this trophy five times and wasted at least 5 minutes and and all right.

They sometimes they drop something right before they're about to die or whatever. You I rolled the dice maybe four or five times on it where I was like, \"This guy seems like he's about to die.
