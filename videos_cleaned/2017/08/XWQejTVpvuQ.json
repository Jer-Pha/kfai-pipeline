Yeah, Sleepy Hollow, like get a photo Jon Snow coming in with I badass like like a ball on a chain with an onliner inches. Actually, what was his storyline again? Why is he like half dead? He's a half Walker. I don't remember why though. I have no idea what he's watching the army. He's like been following the but at the end you see the most dreadful in just attacked.

It's like a soap opera and that's the only problem like that's that's the one the bad thing about how fast this is all moving that I don't feel like these two characters actually really love each other.

I'm enjoying it. I'm going to finish it, but again, I'm enjoying it in spite of itself at moments, which sucks. Let's get to the news. Go for it. The first of these are too much going on. This comes from over at IGN from Jim Vejvoda. We don't know too much about the four Game of Thrones spin-off series currently in the works at HBO. We know they are confirmed off the record, and that no existing characters will be included, and that no potential spin-off will air until the main series ends with Season 8. One of the spin-offs is being developed by Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin and Kick-Ass screenwriter Jane Goldman. He chatted on the phone today with Uproxx about the series, asking if it will contain any supernatural elements. Blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever. What we're getting at here is on there was one main point that",

What we're getting at here is on there was one main point that Game of Thrones spin-off will be recognizable as a past event to fans. Okay, it's going to be something that we've heard about. So it might be the Doom of Valyria, it might be... Got it. Well, I mean, I guess you could be Robert's Rebellion, because we said no returning characters. We'll see. This excites me though. I didn't want to be some random ass spin-off of just like some prequel that has no consequence on what we write, we know. I want to see what they're done. Well, I wonder if it's going to suffer from the same issue that we're having with like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, right? Which is that you're there's... it's just there's a weird thing that happens when I watch those film, with that film, where I'm like, I kind of know ultimately how the storyline ends, so there's no real nothing at stake",

Yeah, it's done well. Go Titanic. I like that movie a lot. So Tim, it was great. How **** dare you. Again, it's not to say that I think the Game of Thrones creators will tell an awesome story and it would be cool to see how that's all flushed out, but it's going to be it's going to a constant comparison to the main Game of Thrones. And I think that my thing is we've been talking earlier about how what Game of Thrones is is great character development.

We've gotten so many years of the the build up, but I feel like this spin-off could go back to what we loved about Game of Thrones, which is through the cast of characters. You're going to **** love all them. You're not going to be able to pronounce the names in the beginning, right? Be really confused with who they are and how they relate if you're Nick here to be that video guy at all times. Yeah, so it's fine. I'll call the redheaded guy, the right-handed guy.
