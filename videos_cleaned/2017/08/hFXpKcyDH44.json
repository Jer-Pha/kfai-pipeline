Actually, I'm sorry, then you get Batman Returns. I was like, it's not that way. You know, that was a reason for Schumacher actually, because kids were crying and McDonald's pulled out of advertising because of, really? One, yeah, I don't know, a huge controversy that Penguin was so sexual. Oh, yeah, yeah, shit on my bed. And they were, look, this is like, we got it, let me put a button down.

Yeah, and he was like, people were ripping out designs because they were giving it to this, the Chinese markets to make molds for toys. So they had these unfinished prototypes and like, yep, that's good. And then they were shoving this shit out for kids to buy. And then everything had to be like, like what's an Uma Thurman was like, Joel would scream out over a megaphone, remember, this is for kids. It's a toys commercial.

No. And like, that's disgusting. And do we need that? And that's when he knew he was like, I don't, I'm not gonna do the next one of these. Like, it's just too much.
