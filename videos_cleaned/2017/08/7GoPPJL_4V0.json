Cat got the cream. I'm their only other phrase I can think of. Gothic, is that a phrase? That's an idiom, is it? Check out the cream. I'm not sure that one. The cat got the cream. I mean, you gotta get a cream. I mean, that's like milk and cream stuff. Yeah, kindafunny.com/yourewrong if you're watching live. I want to correct us if that's not a real turn of phrase. Sure it is. Amy Gillis is watching, she'll let us know. I'm sure Kat, it's not an Irish thing. You sure love cream. Regardless, yes, I'm aware that they love cream, but I mean, that's like giraffe got the tree.

Not alone on the same thing. Work together, find a vehicle, and fight opposing teams and the shrinking map to survive and win. To catch that base, to get that stake. We knew it was coming. We knew something's gonna do a book, man. I I never ever thought about Grand Theft Auto. What a perfect fit for it. Totally. Especially because over the past like two years, they have they've added in like loads of game modes that you wouldn't consider like traditional GTA Online modes. Like they've gone crazy.

And let alone all the the the sort of out of the metagame stuff that they've been adding in probably in the first year more so. Sure. So it it kind of made sense for whatever reason when they designed GTA Online, they designed it in a way that has allowed them to expanded way beyond what we thought that game was supposed to be. I'm sorry. Especially in the Heists, right? Exactly. It's really existing world and do missions that cool stuff from the single player. We're gonna do it in multiplayer.

I feel like the thing that has that most people have a problem with with GTA is the the the shooting mechanics and the cover mechanics. And I don't people are either turned off or turned on to it. A lot of the game modes in GTA because they involve so many more other elements, they kind of get away with it. And I don't know if I'd be able to play this. I'll have to give it a go.

Just 'cause I'm better with a controller, I feel. I don't know how to use PC gaming stuff. I'm stupid. I'm an idiot. Everybody hates a lot of buttons. I'm sorry though. Like that was the thing of like even we were playing it and we the Party Modes that are up right now for a PUBG, and when we just play around the office and we don't record it, it is that thing of I'm good at, you know, camping and hiding and getting down to the final ten.

That's a game where it's like you have to put so many hours in to get the most miniscule amount of shooting in to understand how to shoot better, right? Whereas GTA, I've grown up with GTA. I do. I was good at GTA Online when we'd run around, do those things. So this is actually more appealing to me in the way of, oh, I know the mechanics of that world. I know how to play that. I want to jump in and try this. And that's gonna be the most interesting thing is the fact that, you know, I think before PUBG, and we were talking about all these Steam numbers all the time, we were always talking about it, man, GTA 5 is still on the NPD.

We kept we asked recently on this show, you know, to ask you guys KindaFunny.com/kfgd to write in and tell us why you're still playing or why you just write it up. And so many people did. And this, I think honestly, is going to be a big boon to that of at least getting you back in if you if you write online and put it down. Oh, try this, 'cause it's kind of that. And then even for me, where I'm like, oh, I'm more comfortable in that. And I always seen people having a great time in GTA Online, and I've never really given it the time of day. You're right.

If I wanna hang out, but but if I wanna play a round of golf, they'll do that in GTA Online. Yeah, and this is just like another way of obviously keeping that crowd very entertained. Yeah, but this does have the other element of, okay, there's a lot of people to work on Grand Theft Auto 5. Yeah, GTA Online is free, right? It's right there, just sitting there. It's updating or it's not if you've got installed. But you can go play with everyone if you've already have it. They have that install base.

It's gonna be more like, I mean, even the key are the industry management's basically non-existent. Share top shares, you're sure.

It had some shining moments and is unlike anything in any other gaming ecosystem. Steam does have the Game Hub, and that is somewhat similar to Miiverse in that it's centralized place for people to talk about that specific game. However, because there is nothing that shows up in the game, it's completely optional, and most gamers probably never look at it. While I'm sure many people would see this as a negative, Miiverse posts being shown in game for many of its first party games made the community feel more active than it would otherwise.

Yeah, cat always gets the cream is gonna be problem goes. Yeah, that's not. This is a tweet from the CEO: Stardew Valley Switch is coming along very well. The last known bugs have been fixed and we're submitting for testing this week. Woo! Which would indicate that that's pretty much the final hurdle, which for me would indicate that at the Nindies event tomorrow, hey, Stardew Valley is coming this day and they give you a date.

I'm sure Nintendo's not thrilled about that tweet. Right, here's my question for the Nindies event tomorrow: I'm now predicting for sure we get the Stardew Valley date. Hmm, do you think we get a date for Rocket League tomorrow? Rocket League came out of the blocks to Twitter yesterday saying, hey, first time you'll be able to play Switch Rocket League is at PAX this weekend. Oh, really? So that's also a game that's incredibly close. Maybe it's weird. I don't really consider it as an independent game of share, just one India Steve feels to me more like Stardew Valley, of course. Yeah, um, yeah, I mean, it'll be cool to get that. I'm sort of more interested, I mean, we know what's coming some stage in like November, right?

Wow, okay. Because the Switch now, because like there's so many games coming out on us, which are like even the small ones I'm really enjoying. Even all the NeoGeo shit that's going up there, I'm like getting a bunch of it. Super Strikers and enjoying that stuff. And Kingdom Battle just got there. I'm like, I took a bunch of flights last weekend. I was just like dying to play more games. I've burned through Sonic. Sure. I just want to see what they have coming here for the next like, like five or six months.

Yeah, the fact that in previous years, people would use and they were trying to enter the industry with some sort of portfolio post leader. They've gone to college and honest or they've worked on their own stuff and they put it up.

Alright, I am challenging everyone to figure it out and do one. I don't want **** 15 Kinda Funny ones. I want to join one and just have it be the one. So I need the forums and the the Reddit and the Facebook uniting your trilogy here. Discord, you're in there somewhere too. I don't know your platform exactly and figure out how we get one, just a funny Destiny 2 clan together so we can all join and have a good time. Danny, yes sir. What do we get wrong? Then we got a couple. Remember if you're watching the show live on Twitch, you can go to kindafunny.com/yourewrong. Tell us what we",

Tell us what we screwed up. Alright, Capitalist Pig. First of all, XCOM 2: War of the Chosen only comes in on PC today. The Kotaku article was wrong. It's a in Kotaku. Xbox One, PS4, September 1st. They here and much I like to go. Absolver also not on Xbox One and PS4 and PC only. Xbox tomorrow. I guess are fact checking these Kotaku kids. We also have editorializing happening there. Titanfall 2. Greg, the Friday the 13th update brought bug fixes and small maps, but not any of the new DLC like the Spring Break costumes. Somebody told me those are coming soon. Okay, my apologies. Until Dolan actually came in August, the end of August. Not really. Yeah, we forgot a game. We forgot this two little gem on the PlayStation Vita called Licky the Lucky Lizard Lives Again.

Assassin's Creed's trailer was by Leonard Cohen. So I was right actually. It was that icon. Yeah, you want a talker. Uh-huh. And I think that's it, buddy. Oh, very important one from Spasm Gasm. Adult cats are generally lactose intolerant. Doesn't stop him licking that cream though. Photo segment. Everybody's Golf is awesome. Sean Patrick wrote into KindaFunny.com/kfgd and says, Greg, not so much a question, but more of an excellent. We state meant Everybody's Golf is **** awesome.

I'd love to spend my day on the links. However, eighth-grade English won't teach itself. Loved all of you as always. Sean Patrick. Was there early copies of attempt at people? There were. But I, so this is something interesting. The other day on Twitter, a best friend hit me up and it was just at GameOverGreggy. He explained at Dan Stapleton why Hot Shots matters. And I was like, what? And I clicked in and it was Dan at IGN. Somebody asked him like, hey, when's the Hot Shots review going or Everybody's Golf would be going up? And he's like, we're not doing one, right? He's like, I know. I'm not saying the game's bad. It's just that nobody this through many tweets",

And this kid, this guy was writing me like, I know you got a kid with some otherwise, Greg. And I'm like, no. Like that's what's awesome about right now is the fact that, hey, guess what? Like the smallest game will get covered by somebody, a smaller site that has a passion for it and has a history in it. Stuff. I totally get why and Everybody's Golf might not make sense for IGN review. Any reveal, any organization has to pick their battles. And you may remember 0 minutes ago the amount of games we listed all exactly releases. And then imagine that for the next month. Yeah, people already have games and there's a reason you're not coming to us for Absolver news, right? Because it's like we haven't. You got to play your passions and do what",
