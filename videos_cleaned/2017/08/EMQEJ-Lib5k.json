Pure one, Tim Gettys, let Tim host. How are you, sir? I am fantastic. Fantastic, you say. Watched the Castlevania series on Netflix this weekend. Enjoyed it quite a bit. Okay, inspired me to play Castlevania 3 for the first time in in many a moon. Oh, many a moon. Okay. Oh, I never beat it. Don't think I've ever beat any of the Castlevania games, even Symphony of the Night. No. Okay. Yeah, no, no, no. Got really far, but but Castlevania 3, a lot of fun, lot of fun playing that game. Okay, good. Well, that's a good one. How was the series? How was it? It was great. It was great. It's it ended prematurely. It was only four episodes. As soon as it was really getting good is when it just stopped and I'm like, such a cliffhanger. Hour-long episodes. What? I'm looking 40-minute episodes. You can bang thing out quick.

Really faithful to the series, um, as far as I know, at least. I'm sure people will say otherwise that are really in the know. Um, but I thought they did a really good job of nailing the tone and it we've seen so many fan films and so many just random things of Castlevania and it always misses misses the Mark. I feel like this one did a really great job at it. The one my biggest criticism is it didn't use the Castlevania music at all. Lame. And it's dumb. Like that is a such a such a bad decision. I I hope that it's some stupid licensing thing. Yeah, uh, because that was a very bad call if they did that on purpose. Okay, well, pieces of housekeeping for you Kinda Funny fans.

That's Batman and Joker from the series. If you're watching us later, it'll be up on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames at a later date. Also, if you're a Patreon supporter, Troy's sticking around to do GameOverGreggy after that. So it's a big day of streaming content on Kinda Funny.

What I want to do is wait into Middle-earth: Shadow of War's microtransactions. Get ready, put on your B.O. upset about this one. Yes and no, it's all over the map. Let's go over on the WB blog. It is reported about the Middle-earth: Shadow of War microtransactions and it reads the following: An important aspect of the Nemesis System now comes in forging, customizing, and leading your own Army of unique Orc followers against the fortresses of Mordor. There are different ways to do this, including dominating Orcs by exploring the vast open world and encountering them as part of Orc Society, or players can acquire Orcs and other items through the Market (parentheses in-game store).

Of course, Kotaku in in their report, they say, It's one thing when a $60 game offers microtransactions for cosmetics. It's quite another when the game wants you to pay to cut down on quote unquote some of the additional time that would have been spent winning more battles, tracking Nemeses, completing quests, and assaulting fortresses.

Quote, Everything a player can buy with gold can also be earned in the game over time for free, but gold gives players the option to acquire these items faster. End quote. People are welcome to pay more for a shorter game experience if they want to. This isn't my problem and it shouldn't be your problem either. It's not like it's not like you weren't going to put 80 hours into this anyway.

I want to go all the way back to talking about the microtransactions where GameSpot says it goes, because again, they gave you the rundown here in the front. Loot Chests, War Chest, Boost from the Market. Okay. Loot Chests, of course, him, are the ones that are just giving your main character in the game better loot, better gear, better stuff. XP, you're leveling that character up faster. War Chest, however, GameSpot says, War Chests provide Orc followers of varying rarity to help forge a strong army.

All right, when it's a 'cause Middle-earth: Shadow of War microtransactions, microtransactions, a dirty **** word in video games. So immediately I'm it's going to be bad. And then I read through, I'm like, oh, XP for this guy getting Orc'd that way. Okay, it's a single-player game. What do I care what you're doing?

If you're doing something different, is it a far cry from Marvel Heroes where I can use an XP boost and level up Spider-Man way quicker than if I just played through the entire game? No, whatever. However, this is where we get into the muddy waters of crossing the different stories, because I hadn't seen anybody connecting the the comments are all over connecting stories, but the story, the connective tissue between the IGN article talking about the ranked online mode and then this and then what that means, of course, to the War Chest. If I get a War Chest, it provides Orc followers of varying rarity to help forge a strong Army.

It's not pay to win by any stretch of the imagination, but it is pay to get in front of you if you didn't do that and you wanted to attack my base, right? Yeah, I mean, this the ethics of online ranked matches, right? When you look at all this stuff, I it's hard to really come down on a side to this, because it reminds me of a conversation we had recently about trophies of would you pay someone to just get trophies for you? Sure. And what's like, why are you not okay with that, but you are okay with things like this? And I'm not saying you, I'm saying in general.

Should that not be an option? I I'm with you where it's like, all right, you don't need to do this. It's totally not for you. Kotaku brings up an interesting thing of like, if the game is built around this, that there's obvious padding, why is there padding? Why don't we just get rid? But here's my, well, yeah, I was going to say, is it obvious padding? And I was going to use your example, but you would say the one you're tapping X in Final Fantasy, that was padding, right?

This is more for the people that want to do it. Now, once the online ranked matches come into play, I guess for me, I still kind of throw up my arms and like, who cares? Where it's like, all right, well, if everyone knows that that's the way that this game is going to be played, then don't do it. Don't partake in the online ranked matches if you think it's broken.

Loot boxes here to stay? Yeah, I I think they're here to stay and I think they're here to stay for a reason. They're working.
