The problem is a lot of open mics are like 3 to 5 minutes and so you have to practice in chunks and it's very difficult to like stream all that together. So I have a solid 10 minutes that I could put together right now. Okay, but it's, um, I just haven't gone, I haven't been into an open mic in a while. I, I didn't do anything last week. I kind of just, my body just shut down on me. I was like, it's time to, uh, like I worked out a couple times and I was going to do open mics afterward and I was just so **** tired that I couldn't do it. So got to hit it hard today, I think.

Tim, Tim, you need to break the news to everyone. There is a Patapon stickers app out right now. You can use it in iMessage. Nick, I'm going to send you one right now. It, hold on, I got to figure out, that scared the, figure out how to use it. I got to, I got to do it. Patapons out today, everybody. Why does he like Patapon so? Should I play Patapon? I don't think you should play Patapon. Nick, I'm send, Nick, hold on, I'm figure out how to use it. I don't know what kind of game is Patapon? Is it a platform? It's like a rhythm game. Oh my God, look at them. They got a Mission Failed one. So when you do a, B, ask, I'll ask, I'll ask Gia for nudes right now. She'll say no and then I'd respond with Mission Failed or you can do Mission",

Here it comes. It's coming. Nick, why would you go watch, why would you go watch the PlayStation video when you was a Let's Play up right now on Kinda Funny Games? You go to Kinda Funny Games. That's fine. Um, but I just wanted to see what kind of game it was 'cause I think I'd watched. Look, there it is. It's the Patapons. They're on your phone now because of the, the stickers app. Is this something news? It's free. Hold on, that I'm sh, is this something that I have to, um, that I have to deal with now for the rest of my life? Yeah, I'm only going to talk to everybody in Patapon.

I thought that we were about to like get some like, oh, ****, the Barney reboot is happening, you know what I mean? That type of ****. Megaton announcement. P, bigger than Patapon stickers. I mean, like, I remember like the way you came in is how I felt when Star Wars 7, 8, and 9 were announced. You know, Tim, I just sent you a text message that I think will sum everything up. Uh-huh. Good Lord. Let's go into subscriber-only mode. Uh, the Steve 9x says, \"Can we discuss that Greg looks?\" It just says, \"Sorry,\" but I love that it also say trademark from the Patapon sticker app sticker. It's a Patapon sticker that says, \"Sorry.\" It does. I don't understand how it's sticking to my phone. I don't either. Magic of Patapon.

Uh, Justin Ryan Bear says, \"You guys didn't talk about the SNES pre-orders going up at the end of August.\" Uh, my guess is they'll talk about that on Games Daily in about five minutes. Games, we don't talk about games here anymore. We don't mess with games. We don't mess with anything. Uh, Tim, Nick, I'm going to be in Vegas for the GameStop Expo at the end of the month. Any chance of a Vegas Meetup? Probably not during that. Um, we're there specifically for that convention, so if you want to hang out, you're going to have to unfortunately get a ticket or fortunately get a ticket. Come to the show, I should say. We'll do, we'll probably be around the stage the entire time, but we're, our schedule is just too quick in and out. So we'll be there Saturday, about out Sunday, unfortunately. Um,",

Fantasmic! is my favorite Disneyland show and I thought that overall it was a major improvement. Couple things I didn't like. I thought the vocalist was a little weaker. Yeah, so wasn't a fan of that. Um, but all the other things people are bitching about like Snow White getting replaced by Rapunzel. Rapunzel's better, ****, deal with it. Uh, Peter Pan getting replaced by Pirates. The Pirates music is way more hype and that the whole boat scene was way better. So people need to calm down. Uh, but my boy Mickey, man, saving the day. Use your imagination. N, you do anything.

Um, some people, uh, some people are okay with black actors playing her, but others wanted to have white body paint on her so she could look accurate. Um, who cares? It's one of those things like, whatever. Domino to me is not necessarily one of those hills worth dying on. If I don't think it matters what the character, I don't know too much. I'm not for Domino. I think is supposed to be like white and black like paint, but I don't know. People are stupid. People get upset about things and it bothers, do an awesome job, me a lot. Finally, last comment of the day comes from Fargo Brady. \"Tim, thoughts on Beetleborgs?\" I loved the **** out of Beetleborgs growing up. Thought their designs were rad as hell.

Didn't ever have a real finale and that was sad. Like, I don't even know that it got canceled. It just kind of stopped. Beetleborgs, Beetleborgs. Yeah, it's unfortunate. Yeah, man. Beetleborgs Metallix, dude. Broas Man says, \"Yo, Tim and Nick, if you heard about the Bumblebee movie, it's set in the '80s. Bumblebee will be in VW Beetle and John Cena cast. Is you hear about that?\" John Cena. Let's see, man. I don't, directed by the dude that directed, uh, Kubo and the Two Strings. Oh, I'm into that then. So we'll see. There you go.

No, he's never done that, but I just like to, I like to paint him in a bad light so that people like me more. Uh, we'll be back tomorrow, of course, 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time with all the KF news you need to know. Uh, if you guys stick around right now, I will read subscribers, new and resub subscribers. Tim and I will be back in approximately one hour to finish up Attack on Titan. I couldn't be harder. I'm harder than a **** diamond and ice storm right now for that.
