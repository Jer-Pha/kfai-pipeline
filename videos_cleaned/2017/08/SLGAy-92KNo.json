It's hard to admit to yourself, but we're all going to have to admit it right now. I've had a few drinks this episode because I was gearing up for it. I was gearing up for it. I was gearing up for it just like Dad Pizza. Yeah, is overrated. No, no, no, no, no, no, dare shut your mouth right now. It is not overrated. I want everyone to wake up to this fact. I love pizza.

The final topic was pizza's overrated. Everybody agreed. You can leave. Nobody agreed. Pizza is the thing. Fuck said this. Stop. Wait, hold on. The reason why pizza is so amazing is that it encompasses so many different flavors, of course, and different textures. You have crunch from pepperoni. I don't even want to get into it because you guys all know. Think about it. Here's I mean, can I make the case or we want horror monster like pizza?

Is it healthy? Of course not. Nobody's including that in this thing now, and that's unfortunate. God, I miss pizza. I just want to be clear about this. You're Miller, you're telling me that pizza is overrated, my second favorite food. The so-called president of Team Fat is saying pizza is overrated. Yeah, that's right.

No, no, the first time you have Round Table and that zangy sauce just touches your Round Table is good pizza. Is it life-changing, orgasmic pizza? No, it is. No, it is.

You no, no, a good pizza is not a great pizza. Fuck yes. Pizza Regina, bonus! A good pizza will even take you on that further. This is why your argument is, uh, Kevin, can you do me a favor? Yeah, can you go behind the camera right now? Can you focus on something? Yeah. Oh God, don't do that. Ready to switch. Just do up there. We got we got Sky getting close. What's up?

Sure if I can read it in the in the prime lens. I'm so sorry, guys. This is not where I expect this topic to go. I just wanted to say that like, you know, even when we say good pizza is great, it's not. Here we go. It says to reheat for best results and crispier crust, we recommend reheating in.

If you just actually give it to him, he'll read it. Yeah, that's probably be easier at this point. Yeah, thank you. I remember why I stopped drinking on these shows, Nick. To reheat for best results and crispier crust, we recommend reheating in oven or toaster oven. Place pizza on a cookie sheet and bake for to 6 minutes at 425. For softer crust, heat pizza slice in microwave on high for approximately 30 seconds. There you go. That's that's the important thing.

And here's here's the point that I think you're going to make because the same argument you just made can be made for every single food item out there, including wings and burritos.
