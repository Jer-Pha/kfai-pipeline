The the review. I'll do whatever you want. Tacoma. Oh, you want to review Tacoma right now? Let's review Tacoma, Greg. Tacoma, the latest installment from Fullbright, the folks behind Gone Home, a game I talk about all the time and don't shut up butt and love it very much and I think definitely help launch and put the walking simulator on the map, which is a people want to use negatively.

Simulator has been around for a few decades. Sure. But I mean, this is the one I think that I think this maybe it's just maybe it was just riding the wave, right? But there was this and then what? There was uh I'm struggling right now. The game from the Carter. Ethan Carter. Thank The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. And then what's the other one?

But it definitely I think is one of the consoles you're talking about. That's what it is. No, because it got there late to consoles even. I I this Gone Home was a game I played on PC. Like I sat at my coffee table with my mouse and keyboard and my hat hooked up to my giant TV and played like that was it's been out a while. You know what I mean? And uh in terms of if those games are there, I think Gone Home gets talked about more than any of them. So that's what I'm saying in terms of putting it on the map.

Well, I apologize for derailing from your This is part of the show. It's conversational. Whataburger sucks. Um that derail. No. So, Tacoma comes out. I'm looking forward to it. I think the thread for all three of us on the Games Daily leading into it, of course, is that people ride into about it and be like, why isn't there more hype to this game? Why aren't more people talking about this game? And what I kept saying was, well, I think it's the it's you can't compare it to Gone Home because nobody knew who the **** Fullbright was or what Gone Home was when it launched. It launch Gone Home launches and the story is so cool. There's twists and turns.

Tacoma is uh their sophomore game to that. It's a game that's revealed on the Xbox E3 stage. It's a game that got announced what, two years ago now, maybe even more, I want to say. Was it three? 'Cause I feel like it was the first E3 we did with GameSpot. Okay. Okay. I remember it got announced a while ago. And it's been justestating. And even since then, when they did announce uh Tacoma, there was also a drift. There was all these other like, \"Hey, I'm first.\" It must have been It must have been them because think about how many times we've had Steve Gaynor on the shows. I agree. Even at the old studio.

And so, I haven't been concerned that there hasn't been more hype leading into Tacoma because of the fact I we obviously know Steve. He's a personal friend. We like Fullbright. I loved Gone Home. I'm sold. Get it out there and let's see what happens. When I finished Tacoma, my immediate thought was, \"All right, that was fun. That was good.\" I I I don't think I came in with the expectation that it's going to be another Gone Home. I'm going to be rocked by the end of it. I'm going to be non-stop talking about it, blah blah blah. I think I might have thought there'd be more to it for me. And I don't And because of that, I",

It's it's reviewing really, really well, right? My girl KP over at GameSpot, she gave it a flat seven. And the next morning I saw that this after I had beaten the game. Jen and I were making breakfast. She saw me open up. She's like, \"Ooh.\" She's like, \"Ooh.\" And I'm like, \"Honestly, I think I'd be in that ballpark range, too, if I played it.\" It's a good game. It's a good story. It's just not super.

I as I was telling you, there's no stakes in this. And it's hard because I don't want to spoil things. So, what I'm going to tell you is stuff that you would know immediately upon starting the game, right? Like the idea is that you come in to retrieve the AI files and download exactly what happened on this space station Tacoma. You get there and your rundown shows you that, okay, the crew's been evacuated. You're like, okay, so I'm here now to piece together the story of what's happened here. And so as you go through it, you meet the crew and you follow around their like AR recordings or these colorful body outlines or whatever and you can follow them through and rewind the settings and follow different people and hear their whole conversations and stuff and it's a fascinating mechanic and you know I was talking about it I think with",

It wasn't like, \"Oh, well, the science guy said \"It was like, \"No, no, no. Sarah said this. Sarah's talking to Odin right now.\" And that's interesting because and over here Bert and her are doing blah blah. And it was like, \"Oh **** like I actually know these people and I'm actually invested 'cause it's, you know, Gone Home where I'm listen conversations, but then every so often they bring up their like iPad display for lack of a better term.

And so they craft all these relationships and these really cool things and it's like this is great but the entire time there's no there there's no stake in the I okay they got evacuated like okay this isn't like I'm not in Gone Home at least like when I played it and I'm going to spoil Gone Home now 'cause you should have played Gone Home by now but when I started Gone Home I knew nothing. So I started that game thinking it was a horror game and then as it slowly moved on and I was like oh man this is a love story. Oh **** is this the game?

There's a few times they hint around with oh this thing could happen if this happens and again I don't want to spoil like stuff later but like nothing ever comes of it.

Boom. And it's done. And it's like, that's fine. That's good. I mean, it's it for me as a fan of Fullbright, as a fan of Gone Home, it's fascinating to see how much more complex this is having, you know, hands and stuff, which sounds goofy, but like, you know, how different and how far they've come as a developer.

So, I was just about to ask like, do you think that maybe the story is something that over time you'll think back on and appreciate it more? No. Because like for me like Firewatch is an example of that where I played it and I thought it was good. I enjoyed it a lot but I feel like I enjoyed the story more thinking back on it like a year later, right? Yeah. No, I I mean I just don't I mean and it's hard this is where it starts to bump up against spoilers, right? because I think it's in a way not even similar to Gone Home, but there's the story I thought I was playing through of like, oh, it's all about the people and then",

It's just like, oh, no, it's this is really who the enemy was. You're like, okay, well, that's fine. I didn't whatever and I just moved on with my time. So, in walking simulators, generally the environments or the worlds are pretty unique or interesting because there's no gameplay mechanics to fall back on. Did you find that this world of Tacoma, this space station was particularly fascinating in any particular way?

You're in smaller areas. So like even though Gone Home it was just a house, it still felt like I could be in the basement and find something and be **** that's up in Sam's locker.

Whereas Tacoma I felt like all right this was fun. This was cool. Book's closed and it's on my shelf. Does this turn you off of playing it? A little to be quite honest.

Telltale runs into this as well.

So you play as so for people who aren't familiar Life is Strange: Before the Storm is the prequel to Life is Strange. You get to play as 16-year-old Chloe and you get to see the dynamic between her and Rachel's relationship. Now Rachel a character in Life is Strange that you never really get to see or hear from. She's just this elusive mystery figure. And now we get to see her. We get to see her interacting with Chloe and you know where their relationship goes.

And so you can kind of keep your character like with the warp pipes as well like it's you're able to from one side of the map make it over to the middle of the map attack somebody get into a warp pipe that brings you to the end attack someone else and then take a warp pipe all the way back to the to where you started.

Um, as we discussed um, earlier this week, this both of those studios are, well, Motive hasn't shipped their game yet, but it's going to be shipping very soon. And, you know, BioWare Montreal, you know, got Andromeda out earlier this year. So, that means that they probably could form one giant super team and work on something really excellent. Instead of, you know, them maybe working on two smaller projects, they can maybe work on a really cool big project. And I think that that's that's good for them. I don't know the intricacies of both of those teams to know like what their",

I don't know the intricacies of both of those teams to know like what their specialties are, like if they have people that are stronger in design or stronger in art or narrative or what their, you know, what their roles are. But um, it's better for them to team up and work together than I think fall apart separately. Awesome. Mikey wants to know how excited are you for the new changes in Paragon? Oh man, we talked we talked a little bit about this this morning. So, and it is sad what she's about to say. It's not sad. It is sad. As the biggest, as the only Paragon fan I know, it is sad. Oh no. The changes are really dramatic to the meta in a way that's frustrating for somebody who's put several hundred hours into that game. Who I'm a Legacy player.

And it's challenging because when they made the move from Legacy to Monolith, the last major update, um, it was a dramatic change and you really had to heroes worked completely differently. You had to change the way that you laned. You really had to pick roles a little bit more specifically whereas in Legacy you could really kind of, you know, change things on the fly and be a little bit more flexible. They're really trying to get it to be more like other competitive MOBAs, which I understand why, especially with The International going on, seeing that $3 million pot of prize money. I'm sure Epic is looking at that going, \"How do we get in on what's happening over there?\" So, I understand why they're making these changes and because they want to bring more people into the fold, more more MOBA players who are looking for a",

So, the card system is a is a deck building system which affects the way that your heroes play in the game. They're completely throwing away the old card system and have replaced it with a new system. So, you have to relearn all the cards. There's a new gem system that works with the cards. So, you have to purchase these gems and then there's a different levels between the gems. And then how uh leveled up the gems are affects the power of each of the cards. And you have to now manage gold in the game, which you didn't have to before. And the gold is different than the Paragon Coins in the game, which is different than reputation. So now you have a bunch of different overlapping economies inside the game that weren't there before. Um, the gold in particular is",

Um, the gold in particular is something that is clearly they're bringing that in because of games like League and Dota and I get why they're doing that, but I don't think it was necessary. Mostly I'm just like kind of frustrated that I have to go back and relearn all of this again when I've spent so much time in this game and I'm kind of like kind of like **** you a little bit, but I I'm trying to be on their side, but I'm kind of angry. I'm kind of mad about it. But I still really like this game. It's really fun. Um, so I'm gonna I'm going to learn it against my will. Tune in to Thursday's Kinda Funny Games Daily.

I was in a closed alpha of the changes and it was, like I told Greg, it's tough to judge how it's going to be in PvP because it was such a small group and most of the players were pro-level players and so wasn't representative of the general Paragon base. And so I need more time with it. I need to look at it and really understand it before I can give it a fair assessment, but I'm I'm kind of sad that I have to like rebuild all of my decks from scratch. That's that's kind of heartbreaking to me a little bit. I'm so sorry for you. And final question of the day comes from Joe Dossi. Tim, how excited are you about Crash's sales? I am over the moon.

No one cares about Crash. God, it feels good to see this. I am so happy about this. I'm so happy to vindicated. I think you guys talked about it today. I'm not sure, but the the Activision uh president talking about his reaction. Uh there was the uh Activision financial call and that was totally based off just the two days that uh it had in June to count for whatever quarter it was. And uh it did super well enough that he was like, \"Oh no no no. We it it's we expected to perform well. It is performing way way above what we thought that we will be doing more revival.

So, are we getting Crash? Are we getting Spyro? Are we getting another Crash? I think the answer is yes to all of those. Let's get hyped. I am so excited about this. Would you want Spyro if it was a like a polished up port, not a true remaster? Uh, I'll take it any way I can, really, if I'm being completely honest with you. Um, yeah. I just really I'm I'm just happy. This is so good. This is exactly what I wanted to happen. And it seems to be good for everybody. Sonic Mania, you just got to sell well, too.
