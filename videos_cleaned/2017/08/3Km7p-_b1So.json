Ola. Every day, every day when I do it, you make eye contact. I feel like I'm like, I'm I'm annoying you. You're not, you're not. I'm trying to think of something creative to say and then stumbled in the moment 'cause I haven't finished my coffee yet, so I apologize. That's my fault. No, it's fine. Another good mug, another good outfit. You have lots of good outfits. It's as if you've been on camera a lot. You know, I may have a closet full of on-camera outfits. I got to have a conversation with Nick. Is that now that I'm doing this and I'm wearing the shirt and tie every day, I got to buy more shirts and ties 'cause I I've left shirts at home 'cause I wear shirts out, you know what I mean? I can't bring my entire collection here, my entire wardrobe, but that leaves us with five shirts here and that just doesn't seem right, but you do it",

That seems good. Be as long as you have a nice collection of ties that you can rotate with it. Sure, as a man, you can get away with that. Yeah, of course. No, it's way easier for me.

While that happens, I'll read you this article 'cause it's a doozy. It's it's a hike, I should say. Windows Central has an interview with Xbox Platform Corporate VP Mike Ybarra. In it, since the invention of Xbox Achievements, games simply reward Gamerscore for tackling specific objectives, tallied into a single number. Ybarra noted that per perhaps this isn't always the best way to show off a gamer's achievements, particularly with the rise of Esports, where an Xbox gamer might actually be contracted to play a single game all day, every day, training for competitions. While Ybarra wasn't able to go into full details, he noted that the Xbox team is working on something that quote unquote fundamentally changed the concept of Xbox Achievements.",

Quote, this is Ybarra, those are all small things that we can do to the system, and the team looks at them. They're in our backlog of things we want to get done, but there's actually bigger, more bolder changes that we have in mind. Nothing I can talk about now, but something that fundamentally changes the concept. We are working towards a bigger, more meaningful change to about somebody's gaming accomplishments and history as a gamer on Xbox. We can do a lot more to reflect and let people show their gaming history and their status, whether it's somebody who plays multiplayer in Halo 5 at a professional level, maybe they only have 10,000 Gamerscore.

All the pe uh, all the way pe all the way to people with over a million Gamerscore. It's that range that we really need to look at and celebrate. We're going to go big in the area of letting people show off and represent their gaming history and the type of gamer they are far more than we do with Gamerscore. What's what do you take away from all that, Andrea? The score is still there, but it's sounding like it's not going to be as important or as celebrated as much as maybe they're so big on pinning things.

There's a million ways it could go. What do you think it's going to be? I have no idea, but this must be something that's incredibly frightening to people who do have six or seven figures of Gamerscore. Yeah, people that have been Legacy Xbox players for a really long time who play specifically to get Gamerscore. But sometimes change is good. It's scary at first and you're angry about it, but then after you get a chance to really take a look at it and settle and you're like, actually, this is not so bad. Maybe this is better.

Of like, okay, cool, that's a turn off for some people. But if there were built-in base, not Achievements, but I guess badges of the fact that like you've played this for this many hours and you can pin that to a profile or show it somewhere, have it shown off that way, I understand where that would be like, okay, that's its own reward in its own way. And I think it speaks to what I was talking about earlier, granted this was you and me being like, we don't use Xbox as much this generation, but like where I feel like Achievements have been pushed off to the side and hidden behind stuff, whereas before they were way more in your face and this is what it is.

And so I like the idea of as the video game landscape continues to shift and people are sitting down with Dota or Paragon or or whatever game and just sinking a million hours into that, they need to rethink rewards 'cause yeah, in that through that lens, Gamerscore and Achievements aren't really helping. Exactly. And the way that people play games is is changing, and with so many more games than ever before, you don't necessarily get to spend as much time with each individual game. So maybe you only get the introductory uh Achievement scores, which are usually pretty low, versus, you know, the more rare ones, which are worth increasingly more. Maybe you don't have time to get to those, and you'd play a little bit of a lot of games instead of a lot of a few games.

It speaks to people who are jumping around doing different things. But then what will this mean to the people who do have six-figure scores that do put so much time and so much of their value of what their Xbox profile is into their Achievement, you know, score, their Gamerscore? I I don't know. Did Major Nelson make a public statement about this? I haven't seen anything yet. I'm sure if it is, it's just don't worry about it, it's too early to say or anything like that.

It's another small change to the Xbox ecosystem that is cool. No matter how many times they pull a neat trick like this though, the question still remains, where are the first-party games? If you were a betting man, have fun in Vegas. How many games do you think Xbox are holding out on announcing? They set themselves up to have a very strong launch with the next Xbox, but do you think this will make any difference if they don't have a strong lineup? Love the show and can't wait for PS.

Yeah, this is um, you know, the question I think that came out of E3 was like, where are the AAAs? Where are the things that are going to sell Xbox One X? And that's why I kind of came down, you know, a little hard on them after their press conference because I said Forza looks beautiful. Forza is great. It's been a staple of Xbox for a long time, but I don't think that game is going to push Xbox One X units. Sure, right? So where is the game that's going to do that for them? Um, and I don't know. I don't even know if it's a first-party title unless they're going to, you know, reinvest in a new IP in a really big way.

Is the fact that I think as much as it sucks, Xbox realized they lost this generation. And so when you talk about Halo, the next Halo, you talk about the next Gears, you talk about the next big AAA franchise from them, I wouldn't be surprised if they were those are in production for sure, and they were waiting for the launch of the next Xbox or whatever the next real Xbox is. 'Cause no, I'm not even trying to take a pop shot at Xbox One X. It's the PlayStation 4 Pro again, which is fine and cool, and it's going to get people in.

However, if you go the Dreamcast route and jump way ahead and like, all right, in two years, we get the next Xbox, the real next Xbox. This is what uh, and again, it'll be an incremental upgrade, but hey, this is the Xbox. And you take all these announcements they've made, their changes of Gamerscores, the way the the Xbox Game Library, Game Pass works, uh, the fact we're going to get to here in a second with the Xbox Live Creators Program, all these good game gamers first, backwards compatibility, all these awesome announcements Xbox has made, and you lay on a launch lineup or at least a launch year that is similar to Nintendo, right?

Not, stick with me, not that it's doing as badly a bad period. It's selling really well, and if PlayStation 4 wasn't moving so many units, everybody'd be like, oh, this is a runaway success, everything's fine. It reminds me of the Wii U in extent of like, all right, cool, Wii U didn't do what we wanted it to do or needed it to do. So rather than put out Zelda, even though we promised this is a Wii U game, let's wait and put out on the next one and, you know, simultaneously launch and do all these different things. But I think that's how Xbox could win the goodwill and get a jump start on what the next generation is and get people to buy these units. Can I float a crazy idea? I'd love to hear it.

I think they need a really giant partner AAA title. Mhm. They need a publisher that doesn't care about it not being on PlayStation. So who would that be? The only person that I thought of and I was like, you know what Xbox really needs, what they could really just like run away with, is if Valve brought one of their tentpole three games that we talked about yesterday that they didn't announce, and they were like, this is going to be an Xbox One X console exclusive, also available on Steam on Windows. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right? 'Cause Valve doesn't care how many PS4s are in the world. Sure, they have Steam, they don't need the PS4s.

Um, and so they still have time to get in on this generation for Xbox. They don't necessarily need to look that far in advance. I don't think we're within two or three years of a new Xbox. See, my my my argument on why they would be is I think that especially with the way they revealed or first mentioned Xbox One X when it's still Scorpio at E3 last year, right? So E3 2016, when they mention it and they have the video and it's everybody like, holy ****, blah, and we all were like, oh ****, this seems like a real thing.

And I feel like with that, that, oh, this is just an incremental upgrade and looks better on TV, works fine for PlayStation when you're the runaway success and people have been maybe waiting or do want to upgrade and do whatever. When I bought my Xbox One at launch and it's sat there and I enjoy what I've played on it, but I'm in I mean, I I'm not motivated to buy a PS4 Pro, let alone to go buy an Xbox One X. In the fact that folks in the industry who are Xbox people, like I'm a PlayStation person, Ryan McCaffrey, he's like, no, I don't have a 4K TV. I don't I don't need my games look that much better.

And I think when you're Xbox and you want to make up ground or you want to get the goodwill behind you or you want to move units, that's why I think you go in two years like, okay, we start messaging the fact that Xbox One X is just it's an upgrade, it's a thing you want, it's there, it's convenient if you need it and does all the different stuff. And then you come out in faster than PlayStation hope.

I thought that when they announced Avengers and didn't talk platforms, I was like, huh, that could be interesting. What if that was Xbox's counter offer to Spider-Man or something like that to play nice with everybody? But that doesn't seem to be the case 'cause again, nobody said or anything.

If you think the Z in Forza is like the Z's in pizza, it might help you make more sense of the T sound. Linguistics. Forza. P. P. Oh, pizza. Because it does sound like there's a pizza. I see it now. Um, Andrea, you mentioned that Destiny did the Red Bull promotion when it first launched. Correction, Red Bull did the promo for The Taken King year expansion and not the original vanilla game. Thank you for correcting me. I forgot about that. I still have my Red Bull on my set somewhere. Do you? My Destiny Red Bull. Nice. And then this is another correction about the Forza. All right. Pizza. We got it. I really want to hear you say pizza from now on. Pizza. Forza. That's it for thanks, friends. Very confusing. Uh, one special segment for you. It's called, 'Yeah, I Play Elder Scrolls.' Uh, yesterday we talked about these card games and who the f*** are playing them. Some of you",

Uh, yesterday we talked about these card games and who the f*** are playing them. Some of you wrote in. More people wrote in about the card games. This isn't even everybody than did about f***ing Agents of Mayhem, just for the record. Hip-Hop Anonymous wrote in and said, 'I've been playing Elder Scrolls: Legends since it released on iOS and I am loving, loving it. The story mode has been a pleasant surprise with how it changes the dynamic of gameplay.' All right, good to know. Lord Ali wrote in, said, 'Hello, Greg and I think Andrea, because Greg didn't say who's hosting this episode. Rats.' So about Elder Scrolls: Legends, it's the second most played game on Steam, which is not huge, but it's good enough. And I'm going to say it here, it's a way better game than Hearthstone. You should try it out. And thank you for the show. P.S. I love periods. I think he means periods in the, because he actually used",

I think he means periods in the, because he actually used periods. L. Ali did. Or maybe, maybe just a big fan of that time of the month. I'm not going to, you know. And then, uh, a final person here. I'm just going to call some dude said, 'Hey, Kinda Funny. Goddamn.' Oh, no, that's why I didn't get. I was like, 'Why doesn't this have a name?' Here we go. 'Hey, Kinda Funny. Goddamn. Adam here. Just letting you know I'm a big fan of the Elder Scrolls: Legends. It's the only collectible card game I've actually enjoyed since it's the only property with a collectible card game I give two s***s about. Thanks for the great show. Keep it up, etcetera, etcetera.' Well, thank you all. There you go, guys. If you like collectible card games, sounds like this Scrolls one's pretty good for you, f***ing dorks. I'm going to go play Cities: Skylines. Andrea, thank you for joining me. Hey, it's my pleasure, Greg. I",

Hey, it's my pleasure, Greg. I love doing this show with you. I love doing it with you. What are you planning? Uh, you stream tonight. It's Thursday. Is this podcast day or stream day? It's stream day, but I'm not streaming. Um, Steyr streaming Dream Daddy. Um, so that'll be great. Um, I'm going to Alexa Ray's book signing. Oh, so she, uh, Alexa Ray Corriea is now a published author. She wrote a book for Boss Fight Books about Kingdom Hearts II. You can, real stretch for her. She didn't know much about the source material. She knows nothing about Kingdom Hearts. Um, so she is doing a book signing here in San Francisco. If you guys are watching or you catch us, it's at Green Apple Books, I believe, in the Richmond or the one on Ninth. You know, these are things that I should have. Apologies.

Remember, each and every weekday, except tomorrow, Big KevDog's getting, we're taking him to Vegas for a bachelor party. Vegas. We jump into the nerdy video game news you need to know about. Get dirty with it. Go into your questions and have a great time. We hope you enjoy it. Remember, you can watch live on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames like so many of you do right now. I'll read Tubs, Subs, and Tips after this. I remember if you're watching later on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames, the full play of Batman Episode One is up there. And if you're just listening on the podcast, thank you so much. Drive safe. Enjoy your time here at the supermarket. Might I recommend pickles? That's what",

Usually I'm over in the dairy section getting some milk and I'm like, 'I need pickles too.' Uh, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back on Monday with Tim Gettys. Until then, it's been our pleasure to serve you.",
