I'm Tim Gettys, joined by the producer, producer Nick Scarpino. And guess what? We survived the Kona party. We did, 2017. Oh, I would say it was a success. It was a major success. I was truly about that. A great time. I think it was a success because I didn't, I was super fun, right? There was no drama, no dissent in here. Nobody got hurt, nobody did anything that they regret. I think that's the most important part of the bachelor party. I think that in that, in that, in that one small detail, I failed because there's always got to be one person. No, there's got to be one person. He did one thing that's like, God, this one's gonna haunt me for the rest. Only William, so in my definition, could be that. For now, I guess I gotta do that. We didn't, we had my brother and he behaved himself. I was completely hostile for him. He held himself as a way to put, well-behaved. Yeah, my favorite thing as I heard",

My favorite thing was looking over and see Matt Scarpino laying by the pool, belly, like just on his belly with his like legs kicked up like him. And I was like, a little cherub. He's a beautiful item. There was nothing little about that chair. I had the last night when I was waiting for everyone to rally again. We, I was sitting with my brother, hanging out. We were just kind of bonding in the hotel. They were playing some video slots. Yes.
