Additionally, 7 time. And that was my own sexism coming out because what I didn't realize was aside from being one of Kevin's best friends that she had best men. I think I Roman Minard is actually rooms. No, I'm calling all best man. She's also going to be a huge asset at the pool and at the strip clubs. Amigo Jenny, right? She'll be, we'll send her in first to smooth things over and then booming.

Do they put your penis away? Please, can we show off the thing that's in a box or not? It's a few. You're the height now. Oh, yeah, do it. Oh, we're about to do it. You want to show it? So now when you see this, remember again, this is literally the same bachelor party three times. Shut. Yeah, okay, were you trying to perfect something? Let me ask you this question. Okay, please write on Federer, big tennis player right now. I get my mom Roger Federer. Federer, he is the tennis, great tennis, right? Yeah. Did he get great at tennis?

So one of the things that I think is that is a cornerstone of a solid bachelor party is you got to make something to remember the bachelor party by and there's nothing that screams better, hey, remember me and you'll never live this down more than a tank top with a catchy phrase on it. So we have made the official Kevin Coelho likes to party shirt, which we will all be sporting all weekend. What is underneath party? What does it say in small text? It's Kevin Coelho bachelor party, Las Vegas, Nevada. Now what I appreciate that I'm finally on the internet. Nick's company vehicle does Ellen.

If you see any of our friends just happen to be in Vegas, like if Cisco ever gets asked on the premise shirt, it's gonna be fantastic. So we've got a dye going on for us, which is fun.
