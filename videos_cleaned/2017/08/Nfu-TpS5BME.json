Um, and the Mark Hamill's is, you know. Um, and and that was my thing. And that was the other thing that I put on YouTube. The other video that I did, those three impressions of Heath, Mark, and Jack. Um, and then, you know, lightning struck twice because Telltale were casting for this thing. And they saw me doing the three Jokers. And they thought, well, if he can do those three, what can you come up with? You know, any food, you know. So what is your Joker live in like? Where it, where, where did you? Yeah, that was out. That was the thing because being an impressionist, those voices are just so close to me. Like if I, if I, if I see the script, my first thought is like, you know, well, hello, beautiful. Or, you know, like any of",

Um, and and they really didn't want me to do an impression, right? So I wanted to come up with a voice that would be that could be normal almost because they really want him to be John Doe. Everything that I do, they when I read for it, they really asked me to doll everything back. Like the laughs and the voice and stuff. Like I make it very dark and very creepy. But they like to save that look because he won't want him to come, especially in that first episode. They want him to be almost sympathetic and like a tragic hero, like tragic. Yeah. Are you familiar with what how this works in the game? No. So in Season 1, Bruce gets admitted. It misses spoilers for Season 1. I know how many goddamn times I can tell you people to play this game.

And so they, you know, he before the John Doe is there. And it's the Joker, clearly white skin, you know, green hair, whatever. And he befriends Bruce and kind of like, he's like looking out for him. But still doing it in like, not doing it in the Joker way. Doing in the way of like, because the game's so great at twisting everything and turning us on ahead where you're like, is it the Joker or is this guy not the Joker yet? Or is he, can I trust him here? Can I not? And he's so a little bit out there. But he's not in the doctors like him. But he's clearly **** with them and different things of like, it's not the Joker.
