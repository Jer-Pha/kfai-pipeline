Of course, the pure one, Tim Gettys, hosting with me. We've only hosted together one time before. Yes, and now this time you're in the driver's seat. Yeah, Greg would like, you, do you want to host? And I was like, okay. Right, Andrea, host. Yeah, here we go. So, um, today is Tuesday, August 22nd. Gamescom is still happening in Europe, even though most of the big news happened yesterday. We do have a couple things going on. Before we get into that, some housekeeping. Andy has informed me that Party Mode Part 2 of PUBG is up for patrons. The stunning finale, he called it. It is a stunning finale. You should go to Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames to get it early. One dollar above level, it will be free for everyone tomorrow on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames.

We will read those at the end of the show. And of course, if you want to get involved in the conversation on what we talk about here, that's KindaFunny.com/KFGD. A lot of people wrote in today, I tell ya. I wonder if, if they were really happy with Nintendo and they're like, \"Oh, I'm so happy I got my pre-order.\" Maybe not.

Well, well, we will get to that in just a moment. We'll probably several moments. But first, we are going to do what is and forever will be known as the Robo Report. Did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did I say it right? I think so. We have three items on the Robo Report today, a baker's dozen. Support, you know, I thought there was going to be more considering everything happening at Gamescom. But like I mentioned earlier, most of the big news got out in front. But number one, the SNES Classic Edition had pre-orders go live and they showed off a new trailer with some new features and stuff. Did you got it? I didn't watch the whole thing. I skimmed through it, so I only too saw bits and pieces. But I love the Super Game Boy-esque borders they got going on, how you can cover that. Yep, love that.

So over on Game Informer, they kind of wrote up a little summary. It says, \"Nintendo's SNES Classic is going back in time and we're not just talking about the unit's gains. A rewind feature lets you replay tricky sections. All it takes is a button for us to rewind a section of the game.\" And Nintendo says the amount of time you travel back depends on the title itself. Some can go back minutes, while others 40 seconds, depending on what suits the game. It will also feature suspend points, frames, and of course, that unreleased Star Fox 2. So I thought the suspend points was actually a really neat feature as well, because there's so many different games. Maybe you want to start playing one and then jump to another one. It lets you stop the game, pause the game where you're at, suspend it, start playing another game, and then you're like, \"Oh, I want to go back to\"",

It's awesome. So I mean, it's like save states in emulators and stuff, because the other day, this is just a fancy emulator. But I got to give them a shout-out for putting this much love and attention into this thing. They know they're going to sell out. They know that people want this. But when it comes down to it, it's like they could have just put the games on and called it a day. But they're doing like what Rare Replay did, which is like really kind of presenting this as like a tribute to the Super Nintendo. Now I want to bring something up. Okay, there's, there's an idiot that works with us named Andy Cortez. He got one. So congratulations to him. But he calls it a SNES.

And I want to know, where did you people come from? Yeah, why are you, how is that? It's obviously a Nintendo or SNES. Call it what it is. No one calls the PS4 the PS4. Yes, right? But they might. Yeah, that's a **** you, Andy. Just kidding. We heart Andy, but you're wrong on this one. You want to cut, you want to come, do you want to defend this SNES? Do you think this is a generational thing? Now you guys are like the same age. No, or that, no, I'm like two years older than Tim, maybe. Right? Yes, that's like very close to the same. Okay, so here, here's it all say. I called it Super Nintendo my whole life, and then I went through puberty and became a man, and I called it SNES. That is that what you are now? You called the PS4.

It's like I used to say Ryu my whole life, then I went through puberty, call it Ryu. No, that's no, that's Marin. There's an actual penetration. Check our Party Mode on a picture. Let's go, buddy. Okay, well, let us know in the comments how you say it. You're right or wrong. Um, so Tim, yes, I had to ask you how you want to proceed here. A lot of people wrote in about the SNES Classic. Do you want to wait till read your mail or do you want to talk about some stuff right now? Let's talk about it right now. I think it makes the most sense.

I was just before I tried to get it, and I kept getting an error that said it was not within pickup within 50 miles of my location. Wouldn't let me ship it. So they were like, \"Sorry, you can't have it.\" And so I got real sad. And then I stayed up late playing some shrines and runs in the wild. So I'm in bed on my Switch. Yes. And then I get notification on my phone for my friend, the DCD, who's like, \"Oh my gosh, Amazon pre-orders are live!\" So I go, and it's secured for pre-order. Oh, yeah, a baker's dozen.

But now GameStop.com also had their pre-orders go, go live just within the 30 minutes of the show going. Okay, so that's our hobby about 100. Yes. So they were recommending, well, not they, I just saw some people online saying, \"Hey, if you're having trouble getting in online, maybe you want to actually physically drive to your GameStop and pre-order it inside the store.\" Hmm. So as when we went live today, the GameStop website was crashed. It was down. So that's smart. If you're listening to this semi soon-ish, yeah, go down to your local GameStop, especially for one.

They said there would be more. Hmm, substantially more. If I remember correctly, for my friends on the, on the inside at some of the retailers, they say different. So we'll see. But I, I'm still excited for this thing. I can't wait to get my hands on one. Super Nintendo is my favorite console of all time. So when I look at that list of games, it just blows my mind that Nintendo is actually offering all of those in one place. Right, this lineup is insane. The NES Classic, great lineup and had so many great games. But the Super Nintendo on it's like, these are some of the best games of all time. Another level. It totally is another level.

Like those games, the Super Nintendo doesn't scream multiplayer to me. Like obviously Street Fighter comes to mind. But besides that, like I really thought of the Super Nintendo as a very single-player focused experience. I think Nintendo in general is more of a single-player focus until N64. And that's when it became very much local multiplayer for play Mario Kart, GoldenEye, Smash Bros. Sure. Um, I think it makes sense to include two because so many people bought a second controller for the NES Classic Edition. And they can increase the price. That means increasing their profit margins. And then they don't have to potentially lose sale to like third-party resellers or people who are making like knock-off. Exactly.

Like there's a great big questions about this things. Why is the cord so short still? Why aren't they making way, way, way more of them? And why are they using that damn connection? It's like I had a theory a long time ago based on nothing that the NES Classic used that thing because they're trying to get rid of a bunch of extras they had from WiiMote Nunchuks and stuff. And they're like, \"Whatever, we'll get rid of the **** that we have.\" But the fact that they're still yourself, like there's no way there was that much. Like never know. Maybe they had giant warehouses full of these connectors and they're like, \"We got to get rid of about.\" Figured out somehow because it would just think so much more sense if it used some form of USB so that the Switch could use it as",

Yeah, right? Like it just seems like a no-brainer. So the fact that they're not doing it, it's like there has to be some weird, weird reason that they're using, I keep saying connector. Our own with actual word would be that they haven't used that like the WiiMote. Maybe we should ask them. I'm going to see a Nintendo at PAX next weekend. Oh, Mr. Nintendo. Don't say it. What's up to me? Well, I don't know if Mr. Nintendo will be there. Oh, I mean, are you going to be? We literally just call Mr. Nintendo whoever we're talking to you from me.

I was excited and looking forward to possibly rejoining the fold since the Switch is apparently so awesome. But the company's handling of the NES/SNES Classic is such a turn-off that I really feel compelled to never give them any money ever again. Does that sound pissy and extreme? It does, and I know that. But as a consumer, there's often very little you can do other than vote with your wallet, even if it doesn't actually amount to anything. Nintendo is pissing into the faces of its most hardcore fans with the SNES Classic, and they clearly don't even care. And sometimes I just wish the company would fold. They are among the most anti-consumer companies in the games industry, and they just make me a little sick to my stomach sometimes. Hope everyone at Kinda Funny was able to get a hold of some pre-orders. Have a great day.\" He admits it, but that is a very extreme response to it. Yes, calling",

Of course, they have many, many, many faults that people like me know more than most because I care and I want Nintendo to do good. And so it's hard to stand there and be like, \"Well, I do feel like I'm getting shat on sometimes with a lot of these decisions, like all the things I just named about that SNES Classic.\" Right? But I don't know, at the end of the day, they, their business, and they're doing a really good job of running that business. And I'm sure that there's some reason that the supplies are so small for this thing. They don't want it to just be sitting on the shelves. They don't want it to just be one of those items that they can't get rid of, like some of the less popular amiibo whenever you wanted a",

It's just like that cost them money too on those store shelves, and it doesn't paint them in a good light. So having this hot item that they can just have it to create headlines for themselves that only markets the Switch to the, yes, he's making good arguments that this is an insult to Nintendo's actual fans and to its actual core gamers. That is true. But I don't think that's the audience for this thing. The audience for this thing is the, the moms and dads out there that are just like, \"Oh, Nintendo's a relevant thing. It's the hot toy that everybody wants,\" which then in their mind makes them think, \"Oh, we should invest Nintendo with a Switch.

Like, \"Oh, you can't get the Switch. You can't get, you know, the NES Classic. You can't get the SNES Classic.\" It's like not the hot holiday item. And I don't understand though, in the, in the growing shift of retail, how less and less people are buying their things in stores on a shelf and they're buying from the digital marketplace. Why wouldn't you make as many units available as possible? Like I totally understand this line of thought about wanting to limit the demand or limit the supply to increase the demand. Right?

Yeah, I mean, I think there's a clear difference though between the Switch and the classic systems. Like all the arguments I'm making are only for the classic. Okay? Because I don't believe, and from everyone I've talked to, I know they don't believe that they're trying to limit the Switch. They don't want the Switch to be this thing that is the hot ticket item because you can't buy it. They want people buying the Switch. They want that thing to be out in as many homes as possible so they can start putting all of their biggest IP.

I also just despise the way Nintendo operates with their shipping practice. I didn't pre-order a Switch for this very reason. And there still aren't enough games on it that piqued my interest to justify buying one. So I'm okay with waiting. I missed out on getting an NES Classic, but I only wanted to get one for my then-girlfriend's kids to show them what real games are like instead of that Minecraft garbage.

If they are not admitting the lack of games and not focusing on gamers, where are they expecting to go? I can only speak for myself that after reading these, my desire to ever obtain an Xbox has gone down to zero.

And when they came out and just for touting all over the place, 'We're the world's most powerful console,' and then didn't really give something to demonstrate why they're the world's most powerful console or why you need to spend $500 on this console, I was just incredibly disappointed.

Um, they're Sports, huh? And it's like Crackdown, if that game happens, if it doesn't, who knows?

You know, I mean, the PUBG thing is huge, right? PUBG maybe not being released this year, it's going into Game Preview at the end of the year. You know, like, I would have assumed that if they're going to launch on a console, that they would have like a nice polished version ready to go, that they weren't going to go into another essentially early access. Yes. And that to me was kind of disappointing as well. It is disappointing, but I also think that PUBG is the, it doesn't matter that it doesn't, it doesn't matter because it is more than playable. It is a very fun, great experience as is. And then you put that on consoles, people can have a good time. Them not having a huge exclusive lineup this year, I don't think that's the biggest deal.

They don't need to because that's where the Call of Duty's shine, that's where the Battlefronts and Battlefield shine, and not Assassin's Creed. And that's where the third parties can sell, so they can kind of hold back on the exclusives. And we've seen Sony this year kill it with the early, with Nier and Horizon and Nioh, and it was just like a boom, boom, boom, boom in the beginning of year, and it kind of never stopped, right? You know, it'll be interesting to see where Xbox is going to pick up, you know, key partnerships. We've seen them show Assassin's Creed Origins a couple of times on stage now, and that's really, you know, it for games that are coming out this fall as far as like tentpole partnership titles for us.

So I'm kind of like, well, we're like, where's the motivation for someone who's on the fence? Like, if you're out there and you're like, 'Okay, I'm going to buy a new Xbox One or PS4, and I don't know which one I want yet,' and you're taking the exclusives off table, you're not thinking about the exclusives, you're like, 'I'm just getting this because it has better partner content.' You know, which one do you pick? It kind of to me is like, it's kind of a no-brainer. Yeah, right? I'm the whole thing to me is a no-brainer.

But if you're looking for like, I don't even know what, if you're excited for Sea of Thieves, I guess. I don't know. I'm not, I had a lot of fun playing it, but it wasn't certainly a game that I would, you know, say, 'I'm going to, I have to go buy an Xbox One X to play.' Oh yeah, the Xbox One X argument is something that I, I feel like it's way more similar to the PlayStation 4 Pro than they're acting like it is, where it's not something that we need to push with a big launch title game because it's not a console launch.

But with the PlayStation 4 Pro, I was, because I'm like, 'Well, damn right, I want to **** have the best version of these games.' Well, you see how what you said is kind of contradictory also, that you were willing to, you know, invest in the PS4 Pro to have the best graphical fidelity and power experience things I wanted to play, right? So you're saying basically the Xbox hasn't enticed you with any game, so you want to play exactly what it did. I'd be all about the Xbox One, right? So I think I would be the audience for that.

Games like Titanfall, example, or other, you know, tentpole games that are triple-A that have come out in the last two years. Would you want to like go back and experience those games in 4K? Mmm, not necessarily. That would be probably more of like a party trick type thing where it's like, even with a, I played the hell out of Ratchet & Clank, right? Love that game.

If I was on that side of the audience, and I just on the places, my thing is, it's the same as a PlayStation 4 Pro. And I'm sold on the PlayStation 4 Pro.
