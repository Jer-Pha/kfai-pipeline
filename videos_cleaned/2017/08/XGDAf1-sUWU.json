It's the first one that I had to go, I'm sorry man, my steak's not done right. And I never send back food. It was all unevenly cooked, it was charred. They did like the Philly flash, you know, it's like really rest start on the outside. Um, but it's, it's a, you can't have like 75 tables, no, yeah, and and be cooking steaks. You can't do that. So they'll have big tubs or they have an infrared broiler just constantly going through. And it's, what's an infrared bro? I'm not. Infrared broiler is most grills have an infrared broiler, okay? Um, super high heat, but it's, it's uh, instead of using like flame, it's using infrared as the source of heat and so it cooks more accurately. Um, so the whole thing is about precision cooking, but it's, it's French, you know.",

They don't need to change anything 'cause their steaks are awful. They are awful. You just have to lower your expectations when you're going Outback. It's not the experience that you're, when you're there, your family. I would lower my expectations if it was like, when you're here, when you're here, you're here. I would, I would lower my expectations if it was like $10, but it's not. It's like 40 bucks. No. $7 gets you a nice steak. Then you got to do tip. And not Outback to me is like, do I want Chili's or do I want Outback? 'Cause those are pretty much the same thing. Pretty. Now Outback's appetizers worth experiencing. God, God, here, God, here.

And you know, you know that I love this woman. I, I keep it quiet on the internet. I don't talk about that often. But now you're about to divorce her because of her opinions on this show. I never loved her more than when she got to the end of Game of Thrones. She's like, \"It's just overrated.\" And I hugged her and kissed her. I'm like, \"This is why we're married, Greg.\" It's one of those things. I'm just trying my hardest to just bite my tongue. Avid Jen confronted me about it a couple days ago.

Uh, but she's trying to explain to me why she thinks that Game of Thrones is just okay. And I just like, I just, I just can't have that conversation.
