I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer slash seducer, Nick Scarpino. If you were watching this on YouTube earlier today, we apologize to you. Welcome back to Twitter. Supposed to do that. That's not possible. What they were doing, we're screaming to a dead place. I don't you joining us live right now on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames. Thank you so much. We never switched the broadcast tools over from yesterday's live broadcast of the Kinda Funny Gamescast recording, right? We were going to just out into YouTube and YouTube's like, I don't have to do this. We all thought we were killing it. We were having a great chat. We had probably the best intro. I'm so sad that no one will ever see that intro to show, but that great. It was terrible. It was a B+. We talked about most of your shirt that I'm wearing, your shirt. We're talking about this shirt. He doesn't wear white shirts. Is it can't",

We'll see about that. How you feel today? But I feel **** great. So goddamn ready for this weekend. I'm J when I say I'm ready for the weekend, I mean I can't wait to wake up and fly to Vegas and work the GameStop Xbox. I'm excited for this for a few reasons. One, we're gonna have I think we have a lot of fun on 100% as everyone knows. We'll be in Vegas at the GameStop Expo live. You guys can come see us there.

But I'm excited because the last time we were in Vegas, yeah, we had a great time at leisure of XSplit and you and I had a great date. We did. Is use it was a triple positive out of its Elgato unit. You mean we spent like 70 dollars on pizza? Yeah, and that was in Vegas terms for pieces of pizza. It was bad. We were already kind of done. This time we're gonna, here's my plan for us, right? You understand this. I do. I do. You know, I don't. We have a dinner planned on student. Yeah, after that dinner, hopefully doesn't go too late.

I'm saying we go from a dinner to eating more pizza. I'm not against it. There's a team fat move. I've done it before. I don't need to eat the pizza. I just like having the pizza there. I would say there's got to be somewhere in these casinos we can wander and watch this fight, right? You would think so. Now you also forgot the wild card, Luke Hayes in town. Luke, what was Luke Hayes? What am I for a second? I think he said Luke Cage and I was like, the guy that played Luke Cage.

James Cameron, of course, had an interesting quote about Wonder Woman yesterday. Said all of a self-congratulatory back-patting Hollywood's been doing over Wonder Woman. It's been so misguided. He told the publication, she's an objectified icon and it's just male Hollywood doing the same old thing. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie, but to me, it's a step backward. He went on to say, Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. Cameron says she was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother and she earned it. The respect the audience through pure grit. This is another reduction of Wonder Woman's legacy and perhaps even misguided and deep understanding his own character. The the",

The the authorities basically his point was, his point that he was I guess he was trying to make was that we were still objectifying this Wonder Woman and it's still it's misguided and it's a bad thing to put out there. And Patty Jenkins had something to say on that on Twitter. She were she came back with, \"If we might have to always be hard, tough, and troubled to be strong and we aren't free to be multi-dimensional or celebrate an icon of woman everywhere because it's because she has attractive and loving, then we haven't come very far, have we?\" What are your thoughts on this?

She still has to be this picture perfect, like this picture of perfection.\" So in that regard, I understand where he's coming from. Like Sarah Connor was a flawed character. People are flawed in real in reality, so why can't we relate to more characters? In the entirety of Patty Jenkins' response: \"Sure, James Cameron James Cameron's inability to understand what Wonder Woman is or stands for to women all over the world is unsurprising. As though he's a great filmmaker, he is not a woman. Strong women are great. His praise for my film Monster and our portrayal of a strong yet damaged woman was so appreciated.

Right. I believe women can and should be everything, all in all caps. They're just like male lead characters should be. There is no right or wrong kind of powerful woman.

She is not this this stereotypical iconic beauty, beautiful one, but she is still very strong. Will be back then she was not in. Yeah, but but okay, so look look at the movie he made, right? Aliens.

And that's what that was what his point was. He was like, \"Yeah, but I think he's stretching.

I do think the movie didn't I think the movie could have gone way further in objectifying her in making her sexy bubble. Ah, I understand that the care the costume is revealing, but they went out of their way to make it not other way. I should say they went with an interpretation of it that is more coverage than what it is, but it is also based on 75 years of history for a character and how far you deviate and what do you want to do with that ball a lot.
