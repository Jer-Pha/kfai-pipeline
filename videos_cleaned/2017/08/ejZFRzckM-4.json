How are you doing, Danny O'Dwyer? I'm good. Like, I'm a cup. I do. I'm using the Krapf's from Redness. Oh, is that what it's from? I was wondering. I was drinking from yesterday. I'm not gonna drink from it 'cause it's too warm and I'll burn my mouth. I'm smart. That's we, we talked during the show. That's why I've moved all those coffees. Oh, nice. I'm just dropping ice cubes in. I'm pouring the coffee on top. Is it, you just do it that way? You don't know special cream. No, no special. And no, wipe me off your lips. Each and every weekday on a variety of platforms, we run you through the nerdy video game news you need to know about, getting in depth with, giving some opinions, giving you some perspective. Then we jump into all your reader questions, your different things you've written in, your bad PSN names, everything you want to know. If you like that, you",

Tell us what we screw it up as we screw it up, so at the end of the show, we can read the list and keep the record straight. Not in there right now, we're clean so far, so good. You still are the only cream of my life. If you didn't know, then you can also go to YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames, pick it up there, or get it on podcast services around the globe.

Number one: Xbox says it is in talks with PlayStation about cross-play. Haha. Aaron Greenberg at Gamescom. It was talking to GameReactor UK and says, quote, \"Absolutely. Yeah, we're talking to Sony about cross-play. We do partner with them on Minecraft, and of course, we would like to enable them to be part of that one community, unite gamers. So we're talking to them and we're hopeful that they'll be supportive of it.\" Hmm. Gonna happen, Danny? I don't know. Like, game by game basis, maybe.

And there's like a threshold with a lot of games that like, you know, we're in a, you're in a situation with like PUBG or Rocket League, no wait times, you're in right away. Yeah, but there's a lot of games, especially third-party games, where that's maybe not the case. Hmm. And it could help the marriage. Their first-party stuff, they can't do anything about that anyway. But I don't know, this, this is, this really goes Minecraft and Rocket League, right? Right. Yeah, 'cause both those are games right now that are like, play with anyone, anywhere, except over. And in the past generation, we've seen a lot of console to PC. And right, even I just won, right?

I think, yeah, I think pretty soon. Yeah, exactly. And so it was, you could play that way. And so then when it came to Xbox, and then when it went to Switch, and they were like, great news, if you plan on Switch, you can play with everybody, right? Except PlayStation, because that's about the bill. All right. And then Minecraft, whole thing was, you know, for perspective on it, it got announced, you're gonna be able to play with everybody. Everybody thought it was awesome. Not PlayStation. That's bull. Hey, PlayStation, what the hell? What the hell? And then it was revealed, and not like it's a dirty pool or anything, that when you go into Minecraft on Switch and you want to connect to the online, to play with everybody, if you're gonna play with Xbox, you need to make an Xbox Live account.

They're way far ahead of Xbox. Yeah, they don't want that branding on there. They don't. You remember Xbox exists. They've, and they've plenty of problems, I'm sure they get spending time on, and this is not one that they need to necessarily solve for them. Right. And it's interesting, like, I think there was a number of reasons why this wasn't always the case in the past. Obviously, the last generation was the first one that became mostly where online became way more prominent. Yes. And but like, there's a lot of like, the way in which loads of different aspects of development occur would have stopped it from happening.

There's loads of barriers to it, stop it not happening. And it felt like what some games like Minecraft, like centralized servers might have played a part in that. Everyone's tapping into it anyway, and everyone's on x86 architecture. So, okay, it's not so weird anymore. We're all kind of doing that. Yeah. And that's kind of where they are now, where like, I've talked to developers who make online games and they say, oh, we can do it. We just, they won't let us. Like, we could flick a switch right now and everyone could be playing together.

Yeah, it's one thing that's taken, then it would start going. So it's just this, there are, you know, there's historical reasons why. And also, I probably the interesting one I can give you, I mean, I, whatever, you're a business, you're making our decisions, this PlayStation, whatever, it's your, it's your life, it's your company. Rocket League's the one of like, you're already playing with Xbox, why not just let them play with Switch? And I'm sorry, already playing a PC, why not just let them play Xbox and Switch? And who cares? Like, it does it matter? What does it matter if they're, there's a little X in a bracket or whatever? Maybe it is an Xbox logo, but it's not like people don't know the Xbox exists, right? Like they come up a sign, ash for the other one. Right now, if you're on",

I, so it's just like, other, sure, because there, because the username stuff doesn't up priority obviously in there. So that, and then, but like Minecraft, I can give you the, okay, it's weird to be like, hey, great, thanks for logging in, buying PlayStation Plus to play games online. And now that you're online playing this game online, hey, can you make an Xbox account? That I'm like, we're making it complicated enough to play games on PlayStation 4, the online.

And then you get into like weird situations where front ends are loading in weird stuff that you don't want. Exactly. It's like the reason I think it's always gonna be on a case by case, though, is that you look like something like PUBG, right? Game published by Microsoft on Xbox One. Yeah, it will never do cross-platform or not. Obviously, because at least with Rocket League, I mean, there are some poor players that play with a mouse and keyboard in Rocket League even as well. But on PUBG, you're never gonna want console players with controllers playing against PC people.

Yeah, yeah, totally killed everyone. And in fact, I think the Dreamcast version had like, you don't have a 0 character limit on your name. So they'd come in with like these 50 string names. Yeah, like saying like, you know, Sega Dreamcast, \"Screw you, PC Master Race,\" or whatever. Yeah. And then just like murder everyone. So like, there's, there's always going to be games that it does not make sense for people. Um, but like, yeah, with there are some games, I'm sure it would benefit both parties. And this is most of my stick. So what, you know, both, I, you know, this week's been kind of a blur because I feel like it's been one giant week, but then there's been break or whatever.

But I know we've been talking so much about Xbox and catching up, or did they need to? We have some reader mail about that stuff too. But I think this is another one of continuing Xbox doing and laying the groundwork and a foundation for what's right about Xbox of like, hey, we are gamers first and we're trying to get this out and we're trying to do this stuff. And it is on them. It's definitely the balls in their court is what they said. And it is a way to keep that fire stoked because when it did come out of the three, all this stuff, and it was a, well, PlayStation is not gonna do whatever.

Like we had that person a couple of weeks back, one other thing, 50 simpler than the salmon. Oh, you're right. Like that, that's a good example. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, like for these games that have such dedicated audiences, you think so? Right. Speaking of it, number two: Oh, Rocket League has revealed its Nintendo Switch exclusive cars.

You've seen it. Yeah, it's Mario and Luigi cars look like you'd expect, right? Cool. Yeah, Samus' car damn looks like the ship. And it's like, man, that's awesome. It was one of those, \"Oh, man, Rocket League's out. I hope I get to play that. I'm remembering my Switch and play. Let it pack. Oh, damn it, it's not out yet.\" All right. One of those things of like, Rocket League is for me gonna get new legs on the Switch, which is really impressive because it came to PlayStation, played it.
