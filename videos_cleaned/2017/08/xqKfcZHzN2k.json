What is this shirt? Murder Island? Murder Island is some Giant Bomb somehow. Watch their Murder Island if you want tips on how to die as a group in PUBG. I just get clowned out. Watch Murder Island. Yeah, okay. Dan Ryckert's not, he's not impressing. Dan's got a lot of solo chicken dinners, I've heard. Okay, I'm not quite sure if he's managed to grab some, some hot group ones. I got a group problem with Will Smith. I saw that you were tweeting out about that. Either Will Smith was over there, I'm with Twitch.tv. Yeah, we had a good one.

First one comes from another first for Kinda Funny Games Daily, the South China Morning Post. They put up an interview. I go for my video game with Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee. It's all about esports coming to you, maybe one day, the Olympics. Who they let in. I'm gonna read the majority of the article. Of course, go check out the South China Morning Post. I mean, them a big old floor already. Yeah, of course. I found this Vig Answer. Shout out to them. Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, said in an exclusive interview that the games, and this being the Olympic Games, had welcomed several new sports that are popular with Millennials. But on esports, despite their stellar rise, it would have to proceed with caution. Quote, \"We want to promote non-discrimination, non-violence, and peace among people. This doesn't match",

But those that involve gratuitous violence and bloodshed, when again, quote unquote, Olympic values,\" Bach said. \"So if ever somebody is competing at playing football virtually or playing other sports virtually, this is of high interest. We hope that, we hope that then these players are really delivering sports performance. If fans at the end would even play the sports in the real world, we will be even more happy,\" he said.

Yeah, thank you. China has already recognized esports as a legitimate form of competition, and there have been discussions on whether to include them in China's National Games. But as an op-ed commentary on the subject published on Sunday said that the short life cycles of some video games, driven by the need for companies to keep making money, and the difficulty of establishing clear rules of competition, complicated their inclusion. Paris, which is soon to be formally announced as the host city for the 2024 Olympic Games, has not ruled out the possibility of including esports as a medal event. But Bach said it was still too early to say, quote, \"These discussions are going on. It will take some time because this industry is now shaping itself.\" Bach said, \"It is a successful industry, but it's not yet really established in an",

He said, \"You have to have somebody who is guaranteeing you these athletes about doing video games, these athletes doing sports games are not doped, that they are following technical rules, that they are respecting each other.\" On selecting new sports for the Olympics to attract younger people, Bach said his criteria included whether they were widely practiced and whether they offered equal opportunity for men and women and for developing countries. For the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020, the committee picked five new sports: Skateboarding, surfing, sports climbing, karate, and baseball softball as a single entity from 31 bidders.

Despite being the world's most watched multi-sporting event, the Olympic Games is losing young audiences on television. It goes on then to go through a whole bunch of demographics about how, all right, TV viewership's down, but then they're like, but the silver lining is that our poll results are huge in this other interview that, or these other poll results are saying they are paying attention them on social media and such and ones like that. So, lots to unpack. A long article to unpack. But I'll let Chuck kick it off, who wrote in the KindaFunny.com/KFGD and says, \"Violent video games don't belong in the Olympics.\" This is the president, the International Olympic Committee.

Danny, what did you take away from the South China Morning Post take? Okay, there's lots to unpack. Let's go with what Chuck said there and sort of start with the violence thing. Sure. Yes, does it match with video games which are about violence, explosions, killing? And there we have to draw a clear line, which is the quote that I saw reported on most video game websites share immediate aftermath. But with the context of what he said immediately after, which was saying that that's some video games, but other esports and mirror those played in real life, like soccer or basketball, it could be considered for the Olympics.

One of them has you wear your, you ski, you shoot guns. The winter triathlon, as I'm not sure, biathlon. My, oh damn, I'm shooting in it. And which is the crazy sport in all of them. People who do that are **** incredible. Yeah, so you could say that. But I think, I think where this, the biggest comparison that I would have had for this would have been something like chess, which is a sport, which has, which is a sport, quote unquote. It's not, it's a fringe account that has that at video games. It sort of has a similar thing with, which has also ever succeeded in getting in the Olympics. They tried it again for trying at the moment for 2024. It's probably not gonna make it. And yeah, that",

Um, the violence aspect to it, I can see that they might not necessarily want to have video, like what are we talking about? StarCraft, probably things like that. I mean, like Overwatch, it was sprung to mind, right? For me, I'm sure Dota, like in stuff like that. In terms of what is already a huge esport, people are really behind firing guns. Like I can see had the Olympics, which likes to see itself as a unifying sort of global, yeah, um, you know, regardless of how much, you know, what the development nature of your country or what gender you are, whatever, they try and be very, very inclusive. The reality being that it's an organization that goes around bankrupting cities around the world every four years. Sure. Hey, build us this",

Sure. Hey, build us this giant thing, right? So in terms of the violence part of us, like, fair enough. Like they get to pick which sports are happening. Like I get that that is the case that, you know, Battlegrounds probably wouldn't fit, right? It would stand there, right? And if you're trying to get games into the Olympics, like you need the game that needs to go in needs to be one which games are already weird. And when you look at that, like the Olympics is weird already, but video games would be a massive outlier in terms of the way it's presented, the way it's played, all that sort of stuff. So if you're gonna do that, there's plenty of really good sports natured games. Let's get Rocket League in there. Sure. Like, I, I don't necessarily have a problem with them. My whole thing over the bottom, I mean, the whole thing about it, right?",

I think Chuck's saying like, you know, personally, I hope, I hope to see the day we can finally not have to defend video games as they're tending medium. Just let it be what it is, right? I hope we can see to that. Like, with all due respect to esports athletes, esports competitors, there is a difference between that and the Olympics. You know, for me, personally, if the Olympics would have come out today out of the blue, been like, we are adding Overwatch, we were on. I'd have been like, what a **** pandering move. Desperately try to recover the audience that you're losing and do these different things. I don't think we need to see it bend to",

I don't think we need to see it bend to the will of what in the moment we consider sport. Like, is a great example of chess. It never made it and has never been an Olympic thing because again, it's an ancient game about warfare. Is it a game? Does it take skill? Does it, you know, I mean, without mine, that's way more brutal, brilliant than mine, more tactical in mind, of course. But that's not the same thing as throwing a shotput or right, going bobsledding. Like, and I'm not interested at all in the Olympics. And it would also want to be that thing where I'm looking for video games to be the gateway drug into that. And I think the Olympic Games can be different than video games and us not feel like we have to merge them together. Yeah, at a top level. So, and then I understand then for Bach to come in and have this quote, right, of the, \"This doesn't match",

Oh, yeah. And I understand, first off, I understand about line. I understand being completely outside of an industry. It's similar to me talking about the Olympics or if I wanted to talk about bobsledding, I'd say something stupid, I'm sure, about bobsledding. I understand me all probably not growing up with the video games, right? And I understand with like, he probably said a whole bunch, like you're saying, like right on the other side of this, he's talking about, well, basketball, soccer, maybe those games test your skills in a way.

Well, it was essentially like what, you know, soldiers did in the offseason. It was, it was an, it was a peaceful sort of way of finding who the best was, country was in very, I mean, in Roman days, in terms of it just being like, actually, who was our best like soldier? Like, probably butchering history as well, apologies. But like, you know, that's sort of old. You know, it's easy to refute that. Yes, taking the wider context of us, I think there's some other way bigger for things that are stopping at games from getting in. One, it's the, the short life cycle of these sports, these games. Like, you cannot, what did you do? You introduced esports as a category and then change the sport every year? Every year there's a different game in there. Yeah, and that's",

It's, it's, I mean, I'm sure there are a lot of people, but like, I don't look at the Olympics like, why is American Football in there? American Football, the NFL's just fine. It doesn't need to worry about painting getting in there. But even if you think about something like American Football, like, okay, it's an industry and obviously there are people to make money off it and the NFL is a very big organization and XYZ.

But there is a certain element to that, even if it's not necessarily independent, that is trying to create an even playing field or create a sport that is competitive. Video games, we love them, but they are inherently not about that. They are about making money. So a game like Rocket League isn't good because of the, it's not a good experience because of the purity of the play. It's a good experience because they're trying to get people to enjoy themselves and keep playing the game. Obviously, the individual developers are not, you know, trying to trick people into playing games. But the overall, they're like, the biggest influential force within games is popularity and money. And that's not necessary, that doesn't line up with sports very well, especially when sports existed before, you know, in some sort of form, and then regulatory bodies came in too, just to make, you know, make, make them fair and looser.

And first of all, and then like, also just between not having any sort of regulation on the sports and then the fact that they have such a short life cycles. It's not, I mean, we're talking about chess as an alternative. Chess as a sport exists for a game. It's existed for thousands of years. Yeah, and has largely not changed much in the least in the past couple of hundred years. So, I to be, I think that's a big problem. Also, the fact that they are very like, oh, I was in London during the London Olympic Games when they introduced new sports. They're very sensitive about the whole fact that developing, developing countries can get into as well.",

So I go, I, I see that. And it speaks is, I mean, this is the difference in these things where it's like, what you're talking with the turnover, how fast this all moves. The fact that our industry and I would say our world, the world we exist in on a day to day basis, move so fast. Yes. So why do we care",

And then I guess really would be what we're not gonna be in both the Olympic and the winter, right? So it's what? It's only a Summer Olympics. It's not gonna be the Summer and the Winter Games. So it's at once every eight years you're actually getting around to playing, right? Your Rocket League for your gold medal. It just doesn't make sense. Olympic athletes train for years for like a weekend or four years for a month, right? That's the nature of it. When Game of the Year comes around in December, most of us forgotten that Horizon.

It's tough because so many this, I mean, the more complex the game as well, the more chance there is for things like exploits.

Sure, right now I'm sitting on so many edits and trying to get it out and my audience probably wants to pace it this way and I'm stuck this way. So I wonder if Niantic had a similar thing where they basically kind of shot the bed for six months. Yeah, now they've the content pipeline to like get the stuff out and maybe they just kind of put a bit too much out. It's I don't know. It's very much one of the things of getting the fire lit and then keeping it stoked out blowing it out without",

I expect them to go do stuff like that or this, but to see Waypoint and, you know, Patrick and like **** Austin, you're like, \"That's right, good job, guys.\" It's super cool. There was a big push for Facebook stuff about, I feel like, 18 months to two years ago. Yeah. And when folks realized that the the amount of views that were happening over there was absolutely, exactly. And the problem with them was was monetizing them, and they didn't really have a very good way of doing it back then. Yeah. But I like, I like this stuff way more because I think content on that on Facebook needs to be like truncated and shorter and even shot differently as well. Yeah. In a way that they've both done that.

But like, I think, I think at GameSpot when I left, it was like maybe one or two people doing to stop job. We don't, we don't the resources or didn't. Yeah. As IGN, where's IGN had like a team of 15 people. I was like, \"****, man.\" I think it's like a custom scanner app or some. Yeah, yeah. So I think IGN have always been like, had the resources and I'm definitely the adaptability to tackle this stuff.

We had her doing, was this is when we were still at like 8000 Marina Boulevard in Brisbane. Oh, right. Where I was, we had her at the desk in between the PlayStation Xbox team. And all she do, I think, was a using Sorenson Squeeze to **** compress the video so we could put them on a website. And she's like, \"Hey, I'm really great at everything. Can I do other stuff?\" And we were not me. I was, I was the bottom. And I think comments probably just got there. So I just got right here.

If the clan fills up, inactive players will be removed periodically to make room for the best friends. Battle.net players, don't fret.

There was one of those coming off of the Olympics. It was a Rob Schneider one. And it was, it was right after whatever Olympics it was. Must have been late 80s, early 90s. All right.

More of a follow-up to yesterday's question about games in their communities and more specifically with Destiny. For reference, I am one of the subreddit moderators for Destiny the game. And this is where it's Clarke7163 is my agent. And I felt as I was listening the urge to reach out to anyone worried about missing the boat on the Destiny community. The Destiny community has become something I never thought possible back in late 2014. Run reviews dropped and the floodgates opened. I thought that this was the end for Destiny and almost gave up. However, I quickly found that in places like Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube, there was this persistent, slowly growing group of players who actually were playing just like I was. I found our r/",

I found our r/DestinyTheGame subreddit when I was around when it was around 60,000 subscribers strong and manages managed to make my way into the mod team just before we hit 80K. Since then, the community has only gotten bigger and better. And with Destiny 2, it seems we're finally about to break out of the ruins that the original Destiny began as. As of this writing, we're about to hit 360,000 subscribers. And I can imagine that number breaking 400,000 by Christmas. So, to anyone watching, I will speak for all gaming communities, but I feel my unique position allows me to speak for Destiny's. Please do not be afraid to jump into this universe at anytime.
