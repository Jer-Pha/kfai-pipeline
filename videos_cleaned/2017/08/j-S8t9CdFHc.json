I'm like, they must have just syndicated it for French television. Yeah, hilarious. Really? It was really good. During their press conference, I'm totally haven't paid attention. Where's one Rabbids? Come on, I'm out the door because I'm a Rabbid racist. Alright, just against Rabbids. Yeah, I'm a racist against Rabbids. But you in Rabbids, Rabbids, I'm fine with. Four Rabbids or no. Now, and just so, just again, to be clear, the only race I don't like, Rabbids. Cool. Don't want to call myself a Rabbid racist. Now you just put on my business cards from here on out.

Then Kevin and I went to the preview event, did a Let's Play, of course, and really enjoyed it. We played, so to jump in to the version here, I'm still inside the first hour because I just haven't had time to commit to playing it. But I mean, I'm enjoying it. I want to play more of it. I'm excited. We're going to the GameStop Expo this weekend. I'm excited for the plane ride to actually have this to play. Yeah, I mean, I haven't played at all. Yeah, it's, we went up in the play to the events is up. What I haven't played the version, we haven't. Ryan, I mean, like, what's your, you've been playing since a boat?

What is this? I did really love Full Spectrum Warrior back in the day. I know the XCOM comparisons better, but first, it's more timely. I mean, more people are from the Xbox references. They're starting now. Let's go Full Spectrum Warrior, which was this military sim that was actually built for the Army and then turned into a game by THQ. Where's the same thing? You're just, it was literally all you're doing is moving and positioning your guys to not flank and not get flanked and killed. And yeah, it's like, how is this gonna work in the Mario universe?

Yeah, for me, I think the only thing in the first 30, 45 minutes I've been playing is just like, I'm still there where like, I don't really want to explore the world, the Roomba thing. And it's like opening up new areas, getting, you have to get shot of, you started it nonetheless. Place. So you're doing the open or the, the overworld stuff of going through your file in the Roomba, finding the next battle. They're still teaching you the enemy. So I know it's very tutorial. It's World One, you know, whatever I'm on. But like, I'm just like, okay, let's get, I want to, I want to fight more. But I also don't know if that's just because I played so much.

So I'm like, it's, it's, you're going through those little tutorials and you're just like, oh, alright, yeah, we get it. There's, I understand the system. I played a little bit. But here's my thing, do you think we're doing that, Kevin, because we've played a little bit already? If I know, yeah. Are you annoyed at all by like, I just want to just let me go, let me battle? No, because I know I need to, I'm gonna need to learn it. Yeah, alright. So I preach, I know there's, they're gonna be layers to this thing. So I'm on board with it for now.

That's three hours I have to repeat. The highest praise I can give it is I really can't wait to get to this flight to have come time of just playing it and having put my headphones on, sit down and play and not be distracted by having to run around and take care of these French-speaking me. The biggest issue I had with when I played the game was the, the more exploration shareware. Yep. From in between levels, we'd get into the actual battles. Is that as annoying as it seemed to me?

But I think when we actually get in there and you actually go, it's gonna be fine 'cause it is actually interesting of you fight that you run. The problem I think with the overworld right now is that it's too simple. Yes, it is. Alright, wander around. Alright, you stepped on this, you went through this pipe and you came on this other end. You stepped on this switch. We open the gate over there. So go back through the pipe and come back over and backtrack back to there to go and hit that button. Alright, well, I just want to go.

Yeah, not an easy proposition for a game designer, for sure. Yeah, but I mean, to it, are the Rabbids getting in your way? No, I actually, that's the thing. It's like, oh, and like when we were playing co-op and Kevin and I, you know, they all have different classes. We're like, Luigi's a sniper. And then there's the, you know, the Mario Rabbid is a tank. It was like, oh, that's interesting to get into. But then in the cutscenes, it's, it was like, okay, cool, they're getting sucked in. How does this all happen? Oh, this vortex pulls everybody together and does all right. And I'm watching them. They're not being annoying. They are being funny.

But I think it's gonna get better. I hope so. Check in for a Gamescast next week and well, I, well, no, you'll be here. I'm talking about the viewer or not you.

Yeah, exactly. And so like, I'm enjoying that more than, you know, the deep end that XCOM always was. Do you guys see this game reviewing really well? I think it's pretty good. My hunch, my spidey sense tells me it's gonna be across the board. You're gonna get the, you're gonna get sort of the XCOM background people that are, that are either gonna, I think some of them even will super love it because like, oh, it's a Mario game that's got XCOM stuff in it.

I think, yeah, you're gonna see, I would think, I think you're gonna be right around for most people, 7.5 to 8. I think that'll be the range of where people are. And I think that goes in front of eight. Obviously, I guess median, I'm saying, would be in eight somewhere in there. When you actually break down two scores and things like that, that's what I would think based on what we played at the preview event when we did co-op. And then when we got to try harder levels, when it does get like, dudes are coming out, Youth shields and stuff. And Kevin, I've got the floor wiped with.

Yeah, and that they keep right on rolling with that so far in the first, first episode of Season 2. I was really, really happy with Season 1. I loved.

But it's, it's nice to see that a real, real dark take that's not afraid to pull any punches or gouge out any eyeballs or anything like.

And like, yeah, maybe what I liked most about, I mean, this is, this is kind of also a criticism, but I actually mean it as a compliment. The whole, the first episode is called Enigma because it's about the Riddler. Yeah.

And then that's why I'm so excited. They already in us, you know, September release day for Episode 2. Like, they have a pipeline gone. They're teasing Harley Quinn. It's like, alright, cool.

But you know what, we'll just talk about more than sure how people like it. You can just worry, you know, people worry about it's gonna happen next year when you have to do it. You, I mean, you can start parsing. Yeah. But anyway, Tim wants to give it all to you. Yeah, neither then think about what did I do last year? BioShock 10th anniversary. Of course, it's on the list. One year ago on August 23rd, 2016, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided came out on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. And six years ago on August 23rd, 2011. Wait, that would have been PS4. Sorry, your honor. Yes, this, Tim, I'm messing this up because I'm getting ahead of myself here. Both Deus Ex games came out on the same day. Real? Oh, really? Yeah, on August 23rd, 2011 and 2016. The first one, Deus Ex: Human Revolution on Xbox 360, PS3, PC. Then the next one on PS4. And Nick Scarpino rejoiced both times. Yeah, both. I'm so happy. Yeah, were you big Deus Ex",

And then Invisible War, not, not, it's great. Although I think better than people, then history has given a credit for. And then what are the odds that Deus Ex could get rebooted and turn out well? Yeah, but Human Revolution was excellent. It really got to the core what that made Deus Ex good and about the choices, a lot of customization, your own guy, right? And Mankind Divided, totally worthy sequel. And it's a shame that it's seemingly didn't do so well. And we're probably not gonna see it for a while because word on the street is those guys are on the, the Marvel's The Avengers. Yeah, right.
