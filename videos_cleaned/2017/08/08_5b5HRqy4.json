Like, granted they didn't give a **** about him, but like, it's I'm sure it still hurts. I so we were talking about this before the show. I wonder if we're going to get that reunion between Jaime, Bronn, and Tyrion. I think we are. Or if it's going to be like that it was when uh in season, I think it was Season 3, at the end of Season 3, when uh Jon Snow uh barely missed Bronn at that tower. That I don't think so. I think we're going to get an actual reunion. I think Bronn is just going to be like, \"Hey, like, I I'm only working with them because of you. I'm definitely down to be your bodyguard again.\" He gets into that fold. God, and I love so much what's his face gets released and he gets in trouble and Tyrion gets in trouble, but like it's slap on the wrist. Yeah, see, I feel like it might be the opposite. I feel like Jaime gets captured. Tyrion wants to release him but can't because if he does basically",

But there's no way, there's no way Tyrion would be like, \"I'm going to let you go back to your sister.\" Like that's a huge **** in his army. It for for Tyrion. I mean, if yeah, if he were to do that, Jaime needs to kill Cersei. Yeah, like that's it has to happen. I want I want Arya to kill Cersei. She won't. It I mean, like there's the whole prophecy thing. I mean, the show told us already with the when we got that flashback from Cersei that her little brother's going to kill her, right? And that led us to believe Tyrion, but it's like, no, it's Jaime.

Netflix buys comic publisher behind Kingsman and Kick-Ass. Netflix, in the first company acquisition in its history, has bought Millarworld, the comic book publishing firm founded by Mark Millar, creator of characters and stories including Kick-Ass, Kingsman, and Old Man Logan. Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. Netflix said it will develop films, TV shows, and kids series based on Millarworld's portfolio of character franchises to life through films, series, and kid shows. It's you just repeated yourself there. Millarworld will also continue to create and publish new stories and character franchises under the Netflix label.

I'm so in love with what Netflix is doing and excited by their plans.\" Millar said, \"Netflix is the future and Millarworld couldn't have a better home.\" I'm telling you right now, I'm excited for a number of reasons. One, this is awesome. Two, Chrononauts is in this lineup. Yeah, and I've said before, Chrononauts is a **** awesome concept for a comic book that would work so **** well as a as a sure we're going to see it because here's the thing, we already know Wanted, Kingsman, and Kick-Ass are already locked licensing",

You stand by Chrononauts. I know that I think I only had a four issue run, but I think it's a **** awesome. But still, and it's funny because like reading this when it's like when he comparing himself to Warner Bros. in DC, it's like, \"All right, you're not one of all right, dude.\" And then then being like, he's like a modern day Stan Lee. That makes me kind of roll my eyes. But then I think about it, I'm like, actually though, he's **** made a **** **** ton of new properties that are amazing.

We heard that they were 20 billion dollars in debt or something like that. But I mean, you have to understand though, like for companies like this, companies are in debt until they're profitable, right? Amazon famously was in debt up until what, like three years ago, two years ago, two years ago. So like that's you you look at that and you say, okay, but these people are they're not on one year plan. They're not on like a one month plan like we are, right?

But either way, it's if Netflix is 20 billion dollars in debt, they're not profitable. They're not turning a profit. Um, so but I mean, again, that's that's one of those things where you have to also understand Netflix is competing in at the highest level **** possible when it comes to content creations. They compete with HBO, Amazon, anything that Disney's putting out on streaming services. So like they have to be aggressive about this stuff. Real aggressive move.
