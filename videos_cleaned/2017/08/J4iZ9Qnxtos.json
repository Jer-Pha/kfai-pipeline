Right? We all said it sucked. I hoped on the show that this would just be a mistake and it would be fixed. Whatever. Literally, we finished the show, published a show, and Square Enix emailed Dustin, says, \"This was a mistake on our side and not our intention to gate the Platinum Trophy via the optional bonus episode in the Deluxe Edition. We've already started speaking to the first parties about rectifying this.\" Best case scenario. Yay, Square Enix. Good job. Yeah, Greg Miller. I don't know. I'm sure you helped push that.

We can figure that out, children. Now, it is interesting. I wonder, is it easy to fix? Life Is Strange: Before the Storm Episode One is this week, right? 30th? Yeah, no, that's not this week. Then it's the 31st, right? Don't you? No, no, no. What a ****. You're wrong about this. Somebody tell me when one days from there. So, okay, when that hits, that's got to be 634 Z, whatever, Lou. Yeah, I don't know how fast you get a trophy list out there and do. Well, presumably there are triggers within the game codes that are what's hitting PSN. Sure.

Don't pat yourself on the back, people who yelled on Reddit like I did. Good job. Number two is another PlayStation thing. This one might be outdated by the time you get to it. PlayStation Europe tweeted today, but but like 3:00 a.m. today. Yeah, well, we're getting geared up for the reveal of something new. Geared up exactly.

Chris Brown, he's taken time out from making music and being a bad guy. Come here and do this. Be an ****. Gents, I'm just going to get right down to it. What do you think is under the red sheet? PlayStation has teased a big reveal on their official UK Twitter with no information other than 10 second video of an object under a red sheet with dramatic lighting and the text, \"We're getting geared up to reveal something new.\" Could it be a new portable, a slim PlayStation 4 Pro, or even the next generation of hardware?

Gentlemen, excited. Oh, yeah. That would be about that would be best-case scenario because with all due respect, Chris, like you're way off the mark. This is not going. They didn't tease a big announcement. They said they're gearing up. Yeah, for it. So I assume like the rest of the internet has been saying, Gran Turismo bundle or idea. PlayStation for Gran Turismo like bundle. Are we reading too much into the gear? Could it be? Think about all the gear video games. Yeah, Gears of War. I mean, playing that place. Oh, yeah. Here.

My question is, how come this isn't an Xbox One X console? I know I'm most likely in the minority of gamers, but I love this console design. Creeper controller, light-up redstone circuit on the back. It's all wonderfully designed and speaks to fans of Minecraft. As someone who's bought Minecraft across nine different platforms, well, I want this console, but I was upset that it isn't the upgraded Xbox One X console. Awesome. Can we talk about how the design team at Xbox always killed it with special edition consoles? Well, the team over at PlayStation seems to have been lacking in both quality and quantity.

Kind of fits better than S, right? Sure. Like it's not the most powerful demanding video games. Yeah, your LG NOx price point. But they're really young. Bam. Before K passions. Yeah.

Xbox One S has been out what over a year now. How do we motivate you to go do that? Yeah, I think it's only right. It's almost like two problems for two different markets.

Well, I guess that's not a movie, but just the world is like somebody spinning the like the random wheel. Exactly. It'll be this yatra, it'll be this character earlier this. But I can't wait to see is what happens after this. Like what do you do after the T-Rex back side? Do you just think just like a cleanup crew? Yeah, anyway, we it's fixed, come back. It, we're good.

And then Geo also wrote in was like, hey, with the plays with the PlayStation VR headset having been 15% off at Target last week through their free Cartwheel discount app and now down to 350 on Amazon this week, do you guys feel like PSVR is shaping up to be the new Vita? I would say you want all this together. What's up with VR in general? All right, I think the industry was super bullish on it and really interested in it, but like in any other peripheral, it's hard to sell those kind of things. Yeah, I mean, the Vive, like I use my, I use my Vive a couple days ago.

The Amazon thing could have been, you know, the 50% off that might be seasonal in stock stuff as well. It might not feel consistent. And I think PSVR, I'm a little bit more interested in Sony are more responsible for the software library for that one. And I'm not, is there a lot of your stuff coming everywhere?

I mean, it's definitely not going to be, you're never going to come to E3 and have this 45 minute segment that's mainly about PSVR, whatever, right? I think PlayStation understood what they were going for and what they were building towards. There was a second part of his question that was like, you will we ever get, you know, another iteration of it? From Joe's question was like, is it possible for you in a second iteration of the headset? It's possible. I think PlayStation has to understand what's going on.

They're not like beating down doors. They're not chasing down indie devs anymore. I don't know how you balance that out with, hey, this machine's about games and gamers and hey, there's this really cool tech that we're not sure how to sell our market properly. So how do we move forward? Yeah, I think though they are both parts of the same of your story. I yeah, they have totally different market challenges. The Vive's never pitched to mass market. Like it was always for enthusiasts. You should a big PC to run us. It's a room scale. So it's a totally different thing to PlayStation VR.

They added in this whole and new when you put the headset on, you're in like your home. You can go to different spaces or other people and hang out with them there. And there's cool stuff that way. The Google Maps thing has blown people away. And I use the last week to test out where we were staying in New York and I get a feel for us.

And I'm sure PlayStation is talking about like it'll never be the lion's share, but I would imagine they want to put it out at PSX. They want maybe at E3 if they have like again, if they can come on, be like Star Wars and Batman, like they did when they debuted, right? That's when you get out and you talk about those things.
