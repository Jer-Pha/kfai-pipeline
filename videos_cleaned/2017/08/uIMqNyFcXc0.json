My former landlord got so pissed off. I don't know why. ProFlowers are beautiful. They smell great and are guaranteed to stay fresh for at least 7 days of your money back. But that didn't stop my landlord from calling me all pissy about me still getting packages at the old crib that I never am ever coming back to get. I told him it was a mistake. He could keep the beautiful flowers. I love them. I've always been happy with every arrangement I've gotten but he wouldn't listen. So don't be like my landlord.

Um well my favorite comedy and one of my favorite films of all time is Ghostbusters 2016 right? Especially Yeah. They're here to brought me into the franchise. Um but yeah I I Oh that's so sad to think that that actually is a movie that probably brought people into the ghost.

Uh and years and years and years ago when all this started I like when reboots and relaunches and all this shit I'm like they're going to redo Ghostbusters and here's why it won't work.

People that ties people's hands up and it it makes the argument. You put in four male actors in that right? And there was never there was never a conversation about it being all women and there was never all the energy that went into that. You still put four male actors in that same comedy same joke.

My my biggest biggest biggest complaint when I sat down and it was quite apparent early on and stayed the entire way. The biggest problem with 2016 Ghostbusters was in the original Ghostbusters they were the eccentrics.

They were almost they have red hair and cool eyes. It was like they were doing a a remake of The Real Ghostbusters rather than the sequel to the Ghostbusters. Right.
