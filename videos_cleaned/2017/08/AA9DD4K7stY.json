We're, we're driving to LA this weekend actually. Nice. Okay, to a friend's wedding. I, which is, is traveling a thing for you? Like what, Kevin? Jesus, this to give you a glimpse.

Andy, you should be there too. Wait, are you, are you guys going to shoot from there? Are you going to? No, no, no. This can't be, this can't be filed to our social media accounts. There'll be some.

But the one we're recording, it'll be Kevin's Bachelor story. Mariel Turney. So that'll be a great pairing for everything that's about to be. Wait, wait, Turney? Yeah, you ever heard of her? Yeah, she's going to be on the show. Former coworker of mine. Cause I used to let you. No, they're not. They said they're, they're having a lot of trouble.

We've never told the on the way to Rooster Teeth to RTX. I was, uh, I was obnoxiously late. It was like the most Andy move ever. So I get, I get a text. So Andy's the most timid. Like I don't want to deal with problems. No, no, no, check this out. Troy, girlfriend, this is ridiculous. I get a text. Like eventually me, Nick, Nick's wife and Gia get into the, the gate and we're all hanging out just waiting for this thing. And Nick's like, \"Is what's up with Andy?

Why, why would you wait before? I understand this is your first work trip with us ever. We messed up. We should talk. I've never had anybody buy tickets for me, right? I've never had a company buy plane tickets. I'm used to like, \"Oh, so I'm sorry when Big Bad Rooster Teeth was sending you all over the world to meet your fans, they weren't sending.\" Well, I was showing up with employees at that point.

At least seven. At least seven. So I don't know. Is many? Two, three is a few actually. So I didn't know that I could just buy my debit card, right? So eventually I text him.

Okay, you can get that down. I can tell you. Okay, so I'm like, \"All right, this line's packed.\" And Tim texts me. He's like, \"Dude, there's a red carpet area from Virgin America. They'll just like go over there and like tell them that you're really desperate.\" I was like, \"All right, I got to do this.\" Like, and I hate doing this, Troy. I hate doing this. I hate being the guy that's like trying to get something for free or trying to like, I hear you. Like, I hate that, dude.

She was like, \"Okay, uh, when's your flight? When does your flight leave?\" I was like, \"Um, like ten minutes.\" And she was like, \"Okay, we got to get you out of here. We, we got to go.\" So like Tim texts me, \"Hey, we warned everybody that you are running very, very late. We warned the people at the gate that you were like on your way.\" So I do the, I check my bag and it's all good. She's like, \"All right, we got to priority you.\" You checked your bag ten minutes before your flight. Yeah. And she was like, \"Hey, this is priority. We got to get it on there.\" So then I run, right?

But dude, that's the most nervous I've ever been before a flight. I've never had that happen to me in my life.

I'm trying, \"Andy got this, man. Andy got this.\" Meanwhile, I'm like texting. I'm going to read you guys the text between me. Little did you know I was sitting like waiting for like an hour. You're like Spider-Man: Homecoming. In front though is I went up to the dude and I was like, \"Hey, man, I'm just letting you know one of my friends is running late. Can we stall this plane as long as humanly possible?\" And he, he was a cool dude. Like, \"You know what, we'll do what we can, but we have to leave at this certain time. There's",

I've been here since 8:30 LOL.\" Not LOL. \"Oh, no. Tell them you're running late if there's no line on the carpet area. I would just go there and tell them you're.\" He sends me a picture of like how long the line is. \"It's packed here.\" I'm like, \"No, no, no, no. The red carpet. I don't know what that is.

Why would he have to be told about this? But it was when we were packing up to go to E3 and we're all going to come to work, do some work and then go to E3. And Cool Greg shows up. Cool Greg shows up with a plastic shopping bag full of clothes.

We went in into the closet at the giveaway closet and we had, uh, these ThinkGeek, uh, Zelda shields. And so we took one of those from Breath of the Wild and stuffed all clothes. It's a Zelda shield, but it's a backpack. So it's a circular backpack. I dig it. About like three inches deep maybe. You, he packed it full. That's my favorite thing about it. Show, show the people, show the audience too.

Whole show. I was just wondering. The whole point of me even bringing this up is that if travel is a thing for you, like if you want to do that, I cannot recommend traveling with your partner if on a romance, the lady. Yeah, you just, you need to know what you're getting into. Like I did that. One of the first things we did, I was like, \"Let's go and play together.\" How, how, how first? Not your like second date, right? This is beyond like, \"Ooh, we're, we're something special.\" Maybe a month then. Okay, we went to Vegas, uh, and then I was like, \"Okay, you're cool. Now I need to see you travel internationally.\" So within a couple months we did. And she could correct me, uh, but I know for a fact, uh, was, uh, New Year's Eve.",

And she could correct me, uh, but I know for a fact, uh, was, uh, New Year's Eve. Like we started dating in October. So that New Year's Eve, we were in Mexico. And I was like, \"I need you to travel. I want to see you go through like Customs. I want to see you like pack.\" Like the Troy Baker trials here. See, because I like, look, this is a thing for me. Like I, I love traveling. I believe, look, we have looked for trillions of miles in every direction and we still haven't found a place like this. So I believe that you have to explore every inch of this planet. And there's something that's, first of all, something so that is so humbling when you go around the world and you see both the, the similarities, um, and the differences. And you realize that you fit in into this much larger. It gives you a more of a macro view of who we are as a, as a people. And you're not so closed off. And, and you",

And you're not so closed off. And, and you also see that everybody struggles with the same things. And so you're just kind of like all connected in that. So that helps. But as far as like traveling with your partner, there's nothing to me that's better about that. Because when you go to some place that's, that's foreign and the only thing that's familiar is the person that you're with. A, that better be a really good hang. And B, it just galvanizes the two of you because you're, you're like, \"Let's get lost together.\" And you feel more adventurous. You're a little bit more whimsical. Um, and some of the best experiences we've had, like the first time that Pam and I went to Paris, um, we're sitting at this little sidewalk cafe and I'm like, \"This is, this, I've been waiting to come back since I was 13 years old with a, with my lady in Paris.\" Like this is what",

And the, the guy was taking care of us comes over and he goes, goes, \"Who is it?\" I was like, \"Just some guy who's asking for money or something.\" He goes, \"Did you have anything on the table?\" But no, I didn't. \"Son of a, where's my phone?\" And he put down the sign, grabbed the phone, leave, fight, blue.

I can be a douchebag and I'm going to go chase that guy down and get my phone back. Never going to find the guy. Telltale choices came up. Or do I go back to her and go, 'Let's get another bottle of wine.'\" And she thinks I am cool as. \"This guy can afford multiple phones.\" So that's what we did. It's a $600 phone. Like my favorite, one of my favorite memories in Paris. So I just, I think that that traveling with your partner, if that's a thing for you, if you don't give a and you're like, \"I, I just want to live on a farm and like not do anything.\" Then don't worry about it.

First time I ever had a flight with my girlfriend, Gia, we were flying to Austin and I had to understand how she is in a flight, which is very cuddly, which I'm like, \"All right, cool. I'll deal with this.\" Uh, we don't even start. Don't even start. We watched a movie called Batman Begins. Oh, I've heard of it. And now I've seen this movie. Film, foreign film. Yeah, this will give you a good window into Gia. So earlier you asked me, \"Did I teach Gia anything?\" She brought me The Bachelor. What did I bring her? I brought her the, \"What's this guy's deal?

Like I loved it so much. I hope he bounces back from this. I hope he doesn't hold it forever. What happened? Did he go to an orphanage?\" Oh my God, it was so good though.
