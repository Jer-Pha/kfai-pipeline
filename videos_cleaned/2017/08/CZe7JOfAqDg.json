We finally were both sitting at our desks, you know, 'cause Nick and I's desks face each other, but we have our monitors there. All of a sudden, I just see him over the monitors lift the world title up, just his hands in the belt. No, Nick standing with it, just a reminder to me that that had happened. I hate it so much.

Yes, that was a weird episode though. It was different. Yeah, exactly. I think everybody's gone and you know, we had to make it happen from people who like comic books and like Comic Book Girl, and that was you. She was so cool. Welcome back, Kevin.

Um, Ben Affleck, who the **** knows how long, how much longer he's going to play Batman? People are saying he's into it. We're saying he's not into it. He's going to do Justice League. He's going to do The Batman. Exactly. We're recording this after this is the Monday after Comic-Con, right?

He's going to do Justice League if, and then he'll do, yeah, that if he has cameo and something while in that time, fine. But I think that's it. Batman, The Batman, I think is going to be Ben Affleck's Batman. ****. So that I agree. And I so, so knowing that, I asked you guys to prepare a little bit. There's some homework for this one. So I want to go around the table and see who are y'all's like top pick for Batman? Who is the actor that could dawn the cape and cowl and be either better than Ben Affleck or at least as good as Ben Affleck at Batman? And I actually hold Ben Affleck started started making some.

I don't have an encyclopedia. If I see some people in a movie, I'm like, they're good. Great. You know what I mean? I'm picking personal friend of mine, Anthony Ingruber.

And that sounds insulting, but you know, not just a voice actor where nobody would understand where he's from. He was also an Age of Adaline where he was young Harrison Ford. So if he can play young Harrison Ford there, and I'm talking Harrison Ford in like his 0s or whatever, right? Did a great job. Has that All-American Playboy look to him. I would say, you know what I mean? And so here, like as I feel with all of my picks, we need to talk about what is the DC Extended Universe, which by the way, I **** hate that they call that. It's just DCCU. DCCU Cinematic Universe. Marvel had it. Why do we, why do we worry about or just the DCU? Then it would get confusing with comics colia un anyways.",

Then this Flashpoint movie is going, Flash going to go back in time and reset the timeline and we get new actors. We do whatever we have to. So I like the fact that Anthony would be younger than Ben Affleck. He'd be able to be in there. I want him to already be the seasoned Batman. He's been at a year two. I don't want, I don't need a year one Batman. I don't need Batman Begins again. You know what I mean? Just get me in there. Begins again. Usher me in. Batman Begins again. Get me in there. And I think, I think he could do it. I mean, he he does a great joke that sounds nothing like him. So he's got range.

I think my wife wanted to have sex. He yeah, he was in a Stardust. Was he movie? The Neil Gaiman movie. Oh, that was a great movie. I'm pronouncing his last name. No, I think or Gaiman.

I feel like especially after seeing him in Baby Driver, oh my God, I want to see him as Batman 'cause his performance he went from silly Playboy to like, I'm going to **** destroy you. And he can get jacked. He's so good-looking. He's rugged. He has the hair. His hair has a motion and movement. He has the face, chis jaw. He hasn't I mean, Baby Driver was good, but he hasn't done like a leading role in a while except for Keeping Up with the Joneses, which was not that good.

See, my problem with the Jon Hamm pick, because I love Jon Hamm, I wanted to be Superman. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I agree. But Flashpoint, he goes back and he gets to be Superman. Yeah, Jon Hamm's my number one. That's funny. Uh, Jon Hamm's a great choice. I would say my number two is a tie. Okay, between Colin Farrell. Ooh, awesome Batman. Karl Urban. Very different Batman. Karl Urban, I think you meant. Yeah, Karl Urban's a country music star. I was super interested. Awesome. Karl Urban. Karl Urban would be a great Batman. Yeah, that's really good. Dredd, right?

And I'm like, that's the Batman, right? As he can make that switch. Here's my problem with your picks.
