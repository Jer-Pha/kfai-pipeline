      "text": "what's up everybody Welcome to Kinda Funny Games Daily for Tuesday August 8th, 2017. I'm one of your hosts Greg Miller alongside the busiest lady in the business Andrea Renee. Good morning. Run me through where this outfit came from. I was in Montreal months ago and saw one of those cat collared shirts and did yeah, you know this thing where you take a photo of something because you don't actually want to buy it for somebody. You send the photo like I send it to Cindy Tang or whatever because I saw that in Scott L's wife reminded me of it. Where did you get this? Um, I actually got this from a thrift store, but I believe it can be found on ModCloth, which is a website. Interesting. Yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, so for people who are listening, I'm wearing a black shift dress with a white collar, but the white collar is in the shape of a cat, so the face is on one side and the feet are on the other because it's International Cat Day. Oh, is it really? Yes, it is. I didn't realize that and I have two",

I didn't realize that and I have two tuxedos which are also black and white. Yep, yep, yep. They are adorable. Good. What are their names? Maverick and Ghost. Great. Now bring me up to speed on what the hell is going on with Paragon. I've seen you to go right popping off on Twitter about it. We were getting ready for the update. You weren't excited for the update. I guess the update's live now. Is that what happened? Technically, the update isn't live because they had to bring the servers down because the game melted. Okay, okay. I saw that. I saw you quote tweeting that today. Not pulling any punches. No. Um, I mean, you want to get into this right now? Yeah, sure. So here's the thing.

We talked a little bit about it on the show. Um, I was I logged on this morning to get everything loaded because I'm planning to stream later today, uh, with the new update and um, I was entered into a queue. I tweeted a photo, a screenshot of the queue. It was over seven hours long. The queue. You sit in the queue. It'll be ready by the time you're ready to stream. Well, you would think except in the five minutes that I sat there tweeting about this queue, I got kicked from the queue three times and by the fourth time I got re-entered into the queue, it had jumped up to nine hours long. And so the queue they have come forward and said, you know, I mean, I don't know if it's um, I can't I have to look up the public statement, but the queue is kind of artificial because what happens is",

We actually don't know. Sure. Um, we're we've been told that they are working on it right now. Obviously, for every minute the game is down, that's more stuff they aren't selling in the game. So of course it, you know, behooves them to try to get it up as quickly as possible. More reasons for people to buy XP boo, rep boo, skins, et cetera. Um, so it's frustrating. Sure. Yeah, you're a hardcore Paragon. Well, the thing that I had tweeted was that I was upset because they said, oh, we had so many members of our community come on board. We just weren't prepared.

The betas were it's sometimes hard to tell exactly what server load's going to be, but for a game like this that has been was in closed Alpha, then went to open Alpha, then was in closed Beta and is now in open Beta. Yeah, you've had over a year to manage your servers and you know exactly how many registered users you have and that's the thing. This isn't a wild card. It's big as this update is. It's another one of those updates that I feel is big to the the Paragon players, not the game at large.

So I'm mad about it. I'm not saying they're not working on it. Of course, tons of people are working hard behind the scenes to get this fixed. I want to play. Thousands of other people out there like me want to play. It just to me is like their explanation for why the servers aren't working just is kind of a head scratcher for me. It's like, how did you not anticipate this? You've been promoting this day for weeks. You knew that a massive influx of players were going to come today to download and play the game.

No, and you heard it on Kinda Funny Games Daily and no one really called me on it, which was interesting. During the Let's Play for the Samus Returns, uh, uh, DS game, they were a 3DS game. They're showing the amiibos and like, and this one unlocks a new mode. And I went hard mode. And she goes, no, hard mode is in the game. Hard mode is in this game from the beginning.

I thought, oh, I got this wrong and this is information that everybody already knew. Again, like the long and short of this story is the fact that man, did they bungle this announcement? Man, was this a weird way to roll out any of this information? Nintendo bungle an announcement.

But yeah, from the get-go announcing this and being like every everybody's like kept asking kept kept asking is so hard mode's locked behind this amiibo. And they said, keep looking at the Facebook page. The Facebook page has the information. Look at the Facebook page. That's all they'd say. So everyone ran with this story that you had a normal mode and then to unlock hard mode, you needed these amiibos. When in reality, no, you play through, you beat normal mode, you unlock a hard mode. But then if you get the new Metroid amiibos, you then unlock this Fusion Mode, which is harder than hard mode and gives you this new Fusion Suit.

Yeah, the USgamer and when they were talking about it goes in deeper that the the content Fusion Mode, of course, this uh, challenging campaign, the Fusion Suit, this will not be offered a separate DLC in Nintendo's digital eShop at any point. So clarification on a story that continues to evolve. Way I did, you know, you said it once. You said it was crazy and then it kept popping up. It kept popping up. Maybe now we're finally done with it. Maybe maybe you don't know until the game comes out. Are you going to play this game? Probably not. Yeah, here's my problem watching Tim play it.

It's going to be going at 1700 hours GMT. That's going to be a 90 minute long show though. So MineCon as Minecraft fans know it is dead.

What will I see off the official site? We don't want to ruin the surprises, but we can promise that the 90-minute interactive live stream will feature the same kind of entertainment, humor, and announcement from past MineCon events. The goal is to have fun with the community while we celebrate the Minecraft we all know and love. I think there's still a MineCon because according to this, it says, what's happening?

Minecraft is built on inclusivity and creativity. In the old MineCon became an expensive and exclusive event where the vast majority of our community could not participate. With the combination of our live stream and the official Minecraft community events, we're excited to make it easier for everyone to participate from all around the world. I want in. How do I participate? And so this gives details then about the broadband that you need in the live stream. Sure. It says there will also be get-togethers in select cities where you can meet developers, creators, and other crafters and have a whole lot of crafty fun. We'll have more details to share soon.

Yeah, but MineCon in terms of going to a convention center, seeing all this different stuff is dead, right? That thing. If you want the merch, you order it off that. Community meetups, I don't think are the exact same thing. So it's an interesting take that to me sounds way less exciting and cool. But this is like we talk about with season passes or yesterday with all the Shadow of War microtransaction stuff. I'm not part of that community, but I know that I love Kinda Funny Live and I or Kinda Funny Live period.

I don't think anybody's figured it out to have how to how do you throw a popular live event and not have those kind of problems? Absolutely. I think Blizzard does an excellent job with BlizzCon every year. I mean, granted, you know, the premium passes for that, the digital tickets, you still have to pay for. Um, but that that's an event that is like, hey, we're having a physical space where people can come and cosplay and get together and play together, have competitive tournaments.

So I guess it's more of a Sony E3 press conference kind of feel. And granted, who knows what how they're going to treat it on stage and how much interactivity. But it's definitely going to get their message out in a short form fashion better because if somebody who never went to MineCon, I have no real idea what the **** happens at MineCon.

PAX is thousands of games now. You know, think that Comic-Con is there's a lot to see and do there.

I can't imagine it sells as well as the 9.4 million copies decided by Tim yesterday. Uncharted 4 sold, but do you think it can reach Horizon's 3.4 million?

No, I mean, I think this is going to be, I would say, I think it's going to be 1 point something million sold, maybe two.

He said they did it so nobody could tell it's from a big studio, so everyone would think it's an indie game and the Fox Engine could really make it a lot prettier. Look how beautiful MGSV is and it's a giant open world. And P.T. is set in a corridor. And about the Death Stranding demo, they showed it wasn't for the game, but for the engine. And Guerrilla Games devs were there too. It's their engine. Kojima Productions is just using it for the game. Excuse my English, I'm not a native speaker. You're excused, you're great though.
