So at the $15 here, Kinda Funny Games Patreon, you come here, ask me questions. Not too many questions today. I like it. Keep going. Yeah, let's use this. Okay, can the kids hear you, Tim? Okay, I can hear me. So, okay, great, great. So let's see what the, what's the first question? What's a game that has received a ton of praise and recommendations that you just couldn't get into? Yes, you're the best. Thank you. And that was Steven Auslan Stofflet, my dude from down in San Diego. Yeah, so I think there's a fairly easy one because I'm not a huge fan of platformer games. So not in that platform Castlevania style, like a little platform, yeah, soozee platform. Yeah, so Shovel Knight, I could not get into it. And I know, yeah, I know that that sounds crazy. Yeah, it does. I want to, I think that if I like dedicate enough time to it, I could, because I really liked the second Metroid Prime, which was on the no merit",

I want to, I think that if I like dedicate enough time to it, I could, because I really liked the second Metroid Prime, which was on the no merit. Prime is the GameCube series. You talk about a Zero Mission, is its no mission on the Game Boy Advance? Yeah, well, what, yeah, on the Game Boy Advance, there was a Metroid Fusion and then Metroid Zero Mission. Okay, Zero Mission was a remake of the first game. Great. I think I like that way. And I played on a trip that we went somewhere. I can't remember. Probably Tahoe. Probably Tahoe. Yeah, yeah. I know that the the DS and GBA Game Boy games are ducks. Well, sorry, the Game Boy and DS Castlevania games are more similar to Metroid than the old-school Castlevania games. Those are more action-oriented, more Shovel Knight ask. Mmm, cool. I want to get in Shovel Knight and I feel like I just haven't gotten like the right trip. So I feel like, hey, I want it on the Switch, which is happening, right? It's already done. Yeah.",

So hopefully when I fly to Italy, that's one of the games that I'll be playing. You should. Yeah, Paris. I'm flying to Paris. Usually you need Sonic Mania to Kev. I really do. I do. And I probably missed an email somewhere. But so yeah, never been a big fan of that particular game, Shovel Knight, Shovel Knight. That's the one. That's the one. But everyone says it's amazing. So I feel like if I dedicate enough time, I could fall in love. I just haven't. And I think that's my biggest problem. Also, the Final Fantasy series. I've never enjoyed them. I had high hopes to this latest one, 15, and I just could not get into the playing style. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 15, a rough one.

It had so much potential and it just didn't hit it in all the right places. The new one though, that they announced today, the Pocket Edition. Yeah, uh, if they port that over to the Switch, I think it could be pretty good. Really? Because it seems like it's truncating, getting, cutting a lot of the fat. I feel like that's what they said about 15. No, really? I thought 15 was supposed to make things like a lot, like gameplay wise, a lot smoother and feel more different a game. Yeah, well, that is more action-y, but I'm talking about just in terms, there's just a lot of just story beats and mismanaged plot devices that happen in 15. All right, so we've got a question from Dutcher in the Snedeker. Okay, do you want to look that like on this just that it makes sense?

The glue is trying, it's tying the knot. First of all, thank you for the crack congratulations. Not super games oriented question, but sure, you took your chance to ask me a question. What do I admire most? Her ability to like handle situations. It sounds funny, but like she started learning to animate, I want to say now, like four years ago. And when she started, her skills were were not even close to there. And the progression over the last two years, well, at the time, during when she was in school, the progression of the last her first two years, oh man, was really phenomenal. And since then, it's she's gotten even better. And hopefully someday she'll be an animator, like a real production company making movies.

And no, wait, not only that, right now she's got one shot in Rogue One. I just saw her new reel that she made. And it's like, there's too little excellence lying in the background. And she did that, which is **** crazy. Oh, yeah, yeah. But thanks for your question. Let's see next question. Jeremy Shook, hey Kevin, what's your favorite game franchise? Game gaming franchises. My all-time favorite, good old Metal Gear over here. Shockingly, I haven't beat Metal Gear 5 yet. Mmm, that like makes me sick to think about it. It's not shocked. Yeah, that game is interesting because it's it's big and there's a lock on, but it just feels like incomplete because it is. Yeah, and so it's like this",

Yeah, and so it's like this, I'm not getting a lot of motivation to get through the storyline. And it's just, I feel like every Metal Gear has a point where ranks like ramps up and like the bosses get really **** hard. But because you want to know what the storyline is, it keeps you motivated on going forward. Where this one, yeah, like when I got to this level with the the Skulls getting all armored, I was just like, I don't know if I want to keep playing this. And then I didn't. Yeah, about that game is the gameplay is 10 out of 10, 10 out of 10. This gameplay is the gameplay is so is so solid that I really feel like it makes like forgivable that the story is not. It just is sad because Metal Gear, even at its low points, is still the stories which are so amazing about it as well. The characters. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. But I feel like that all comes",

Oh, I need to go, Kevin. Okay, so I'm leaving you alone here. All right, I trust you can do this. All right, so another game franchise that I love, Uncharted. Man, I could play that series forever. They're so good. Really excited, excited for the newest one, which the newest friend is the new and Uncharted out for everyone August 22nd. Today, just so you know, it's August 22nd. We film it.

Other franchises that I really like, video game franchises that I really like, um, I mean, I mean, it's hard because like I don't play as much as many video games as I wanted to. I really like Prototype for a while and then Infamous. So I'm always down to playing new games of those whenever they come out. We haven't seen either one in a little while. And a Prototype way longer. And I think Prototype 2 wasn't as good as Prototype 1. But anyways, Villas games tudo. But oh, Gran Turismo. I'm so excited for Gran Turismo Sport. And that's coming out relatively soon. We've seen bundles with PS4. But yeah, I like to play a lot of different games. And kind of like I jumped into Metal Gear Solid during Metal Gear Solid 2 when I was young. I played Metal Gear Solid 1 and I thought was way too difficult. Like I didn't understand what's going on.

It was Solid 1, loved it too. And then Snake Eater came out. And man, I was all about it. And then 4 and 5. And just it gets better and better, except for 5, the storyline's not so great. All right, thank you very much. See you next one. John Burleson says, Kevin, congratulations on locking down Paola. Thank you. Can you throw the story of how you met and started dating again? How you guys man started dating again? Yeah, yes, we say. So me and Paola. So, all right, so let me take you back. 2008. Hard to get a job. Real hard time to get a job.

And I was super desperate. Like I went to every single store looking, see they were hiring. And nobody wanted me because I had no experience doing retail. My sister used to work at a store. It was called, that is called L'Occitane. It's actually still there. They sell French lotions and hand creams. And she decided that she was gonna move with her boyfriend and bought, you know, in Tahoe. And I used to go and hang out with them like ever. Like I had like a really crazy secret schedule in 2008.

And she's, he knows all the products. He can talk about stuff because he's here all the time. And he's like, I **** it, I'll do it. Then fast forward like a year and a half later, I'm working there. Everyone original, it originally had a work there, quit. Like four out of those five of us, I think they worked there at the time, four of them quit. It was no reason in particular. It's just they all kind of started moving. And it happened in like a three week period. So we hired a bunch of people at that store. And one of the one of the gals was Paola.

Then four would be by yourself. And the first day that I hung out with Paola, I was training her. And we just kind of talked about things that we liked. And the majority of the conversation was TV shows that we liked. So we were sitting there talking about like Arrested Development, which will forever be one of my favorite shows of all time. First three seasons are phenomenal. So well-written and like thought put into him is fantastic. And then yeah, we were talking about bunch of other shows.

We're so happy in love. And I can't wait to make her my wife and be wearing a ring for the rest of my life. So it's so soon. It's like a month away. It's August 22nd. And my wedding is September 30th. So a little bit over a month and a half. But yeah, I can't wait. Thanks for putting that question, Josh John. This next one is Josh J. Anderson.

I think that one of the like there's a game called Titan Souls, which is a very very simple game. It's like what, 15 bosses or something? It might be less than that, maybe 13. All you have to do is go to them and fight the boss. And it's so insanely hard because it's that just it's such a simple game where all the only options you have are to move around and shoot the arrow.

And I and I've been dying to know, were you one of the kids growing up who ate Cheetos and other greasy **** then touched Tim's controllers? You give off that vibe. That **** you. All right. I know that's an insult. And you know it's an insult. **** you. I'm gonna keep reading now. Growing up, **** like that bothered me to my core. What gaming etiquette did you have growing up? Another one of my mine is my friends fought me for the nice control instead of taking the third-party garbage one when they were in my house. Ah **** man.

And that's the polite thing to do. What are you saying? Hold on.",
