Let Tim host, and this is Sam from Nintendo Treehouse. Hey, thank you for coming by. Yay, great to be here. No, that thank you for coming by. You brought us Metroid: Samus Returns, a 2D Metroid game in 2017. Get hyped! If you didn't know, Tim is excited about this. I am. I am also very, you're excited too. All right, that's going to make it easy then. So Tim, you're allowed to play. We're allowed to capture 10 minutes away, away. You've already been playing. Yes, I have. I played for about 10 minutes, I would say maybe 15. Yeah, we're going to jump you in and we're actually doing a little bit of amiibo tapping, if you like, so we give you some extra gear. Get, I'm not, I will tell you right now, I know Mr. Nintendo's right there. I'm not going to count the amiibo Taps when they get tapped. That does not count as part of our 10 minutes. That's oh, right, Miss Nintendo?",

Now, I think you're going to like this a lot. Little Metroid amiibo. Yeah, give it a little squish, squish, squish. Feels good. It does. We got the two new amiibo here, the Samus and the Metroid, and also the Smash Bros. amiibo as well. So, uh, to get started, if you like, we can just uh, hit the start button, hop into the menu, and if you wouldn't mind, uh, just tapping that little amiibo icon on the screen there, we'll uh, be able to hop in. There we go. There you go. So probably start, actually, let's hit the Smash Bros. amiibo first. So we'll just my girl Zero Suit, tap those in, one of my Mains Smash.

So each of the amiibo that we support in this game has two different functions. There's one that's going to be able to kick off while you're playing the game as soon as as you unlock the functionality, and it hits up pretty early. And then another functionality that's after you've beaten the game. So the Hard Mode, right? No, Hard Mode's actually available for everybody. So all you need to do to get Hard Mode is beat the game, and then you get into Hard Mode. Fusion Mode, my apologies, my apologies for you. This don't man explain it to me. All right, just wonder what it was. So, so here, I just, just go to the yes, yep, yes. Um, so Zero Suit and then the Samus here, and our new Samus, uh, if you tap as you're playing the game, each of them is going to unlock a different kind of Reserve Tank, which is great if you are maybe fighting a Metroid and you run out of health or",

You've got this little emergency boost that's going to come back for you. And then on energy as well, you're going to need it. I'm going to, we're going to get all these Reserve Tanks ready to go. And so with these three amiibo, if you tap them after you've beaten the game at least once, you get uh, some kind of gallery content. So it could be uh, sound test. We've also got art galleries for this game and the original game. Okay, so nothing that's like critical to gameplay, but it is really cool to experience, especially if you're into that kind of background content. Our little Metroid buddy is a little different, so we'll tap him once we get a little bit further in. Okay, go. You ready? So we got 10 minutes on the clock for me to, the goal is for me to get to a Metroid and fight him. We got a lot of cool",

It's gone. It's started. Okay, so Sam, what do people need to know? So essentially with Metroid: Samus Returns, what we've got is a reimagining of the Metroid II game for the Game Boy, which came out back in 1991. So technology's come a long way. We can do a lot of cool stuff here. And this is really, I think, for a lot of people, even folks who played the original Metroid II, a brand new Metroid Adventure. Uh, Sakamoto-san, uh, you longtime uh, contributor to the Metroid franchise. He wasn't involved in the original Metroid II, but here for a long time, he's wanted to come back. There's some really key story beats to the uh, Samus's story here, and also just some really cool gameplay delving into SR388. So this is an opportunity uh, for us to revisit",

Too early, too early. A little too late there. It's good to show what happens if you miss it. This a perfect demo. Exactly. You want to show what goes wrong if you screw it up. Away for him, and then boom, there you go. Nailed it. So a lot of enemies will have a little bit of a charge-up there where it's an audio visual cue that they're about to launch a powerful attack at you. If you time that melee counter just right, you're going to be able to stun them for a few moments to get some extra hits in. Also, uh, get a nice big orb drop out of them as well. But it's really a high-risk, high-reward kind of option where you're letting them get so close to you to execute that attack. If you miss,",

Sure, as Tim expertly did to help the demo and let you see you at home to know. Now, what we didn't talk about is the two flawless counters that I had earlier. I was, I, if you want, when you watch this back, Kevin, if you're reading this, go ahead and roll back in black and white, and here it is. You see that? I did. I did. I did. Impressed face right there. Okay, all it was proud, proud. You, we have another interesting bit of technology that look up there. Um, you're going to see a lot of interesting evidence of the Chozo culture as you're exploring through SR388, and some stuff like that. We can't do anything with it just yet, but later on we'll be able to. So it'll be something worth coming back to. Classic. We also, yeah, 360\u00b0 aiming. So the map in this is not a one-P match.",

Oh, yeah, actually, is a good place to use it. So we have a brand new set of abilities in this game, Aeion abilities. Um, each of them has really different applications here. You can see a section of the map opened up when you activated that. And just there to the lower left, it was there a second ago. Um, you can see some destructible terrain. Actually, if we pop it again here, we'll see pop in. There we go. Oh, so it's the kind of thing that's optional. If you want to go really classic old school, you don't want to choose that kind of thing, you don't have to.

And there's a lot of other stuff here where it's really built in quality of life. So like the mapping system, we've got a pinning system there, and an icon legend. It's all stuff that's there if you would like to use it. See, I, I can tell you right now, I would love to use all that. When I've played the Metroid games, it pretty quickly becomes, what the hell am I supposed to do? I'm an idiot. I feel dumb. Well, Metroid II was my first Metroid game. I remember back playing that. We didn't even have a mapping system. I say that was some hard, yeah, drawing out my map on graph paper. And I'm, I'm okay to put that behind me. I use graph paper anymore. Couple notes I have, Greg.

Don't be smelling me saying you smell good. Not like that. What, what? I mean, it's part of the experience. No, but I do like the, the 3D a lot, which I'm usually not a 3D fan. So this I'll give to. Okay, I'm really glad you dig it. The dev team put a lot of effort into really nailing that down. I think a lot of it is to build up the sense of immersion where with the 2D side-scrolling Metroid games, it's always been about the atmosphere and this creepy place that you're digging deeper and deeper into. There all these horrible aliens, and we've really been able to give a bigger sense of presence to the planet here. So the dev team put a lot of effort into in the backgrounds as well. You'll",

There's like creatures crawling around, and it really adds to the immersion of the atmosphere where you're alone in a terrifying place. Sure, this place is full of monsters. So terrifying. It's terrifying. All right, so here we have another Chozo Seal. Um, Chozos, there's four Metroids lurking nearby. And actually, if we hang out for a second, it's time, I think, to tap our other buddy. Oh, good. Oh, I need it when you're safe. No. Okay, I am pausing. This is right now. I don't care what you say, Nintendo. If we hit the start button, we, we'll pop open that um, amiibo menu again. So, Greg, we can use our little buddy here and him in and find out where the nearest Metroid is. So this is another thing where to me, this is like the emergency Last Resort amiibo.

And now I can see on the map there, you know, the direction. There's a Metroid over there. Uh, you, yeah, go get him. Let's go. Restarting. Oh, that was a horrible place to restart. Oh my God, this dude out of there, out of there. Bad news. So once you defeat that Metroid there, and uh, who knows, it might be that you find a different Metroid on the way there. But once you defeat that Metroid, that icon will disappear, and then you can tap that Metroid amiibo again if you want to see where the next amiibo spot's going to be. It'll pop you up with another Metroid. What's going on? And with that one, after you've completed the game, so, oh no, no, that's a room of fiery death. Good to show though, for science.

So, um, sorry, coming back to here. Um, okay, don't worry. This is got, miss these guys. So if you complete the game, uh, on this normal difficulty, you're going to get access to Hard Mode. So the Hard Mode that everybody remembers from Metroid is going to be available to everybody. Just all you got to do is finish the game. Okay, if you get through Hard Mode and you decide you want even more challenge on top of that, that's when you want to tap the Metroid after you finish the game.

Um, other than like, say, in Fusion Mode, you're going to be wearing the Fusion Suit. So Samus will look a little different. But it's really just, you're going to take a lot more damage. The enemies are going to be really dealing out a lot more damage to you as well. So I don't think ready for Fusion Mode yet. No, not yet. Oh, fire rooms. Got these damn shelters. Fire rooms are no good. He went, I'm sorry, Kevin, you say he went back? He did. He went to the other from a different side.

I was just, I, I'm not looking forward to going back to the 3DS. I got my Nintendo Switch to play. Playing 10 minutes of this, I was like, I am in. I want to play this game now. Can somebody give me a code? Can we play this now? But he brings up a good point. Have you guys heard of the Nintendo Switch? A lot of us on the internet have been talking.

So it's really nice to come back and also to the 2D side-scroller, 'cause that's really where I grew up. September 15th. So really soon. And those two new amiibo are coming out as a two-pack uh, the same day. So awesome. We'll have Metroid goodness there. And then more stuff hopefully coming soon. Great. Awesome.
