He's like, Tim's voice is just out of reach. Even if you said it traveled at the speed of sound, it was silly faster than Kevin. I know. I did jump to life. You better hope that my dust tastes like cupcakes, because he's in it. But what if he eats your ass like a cupcake? Um, like Minaj, like Nicki Minaj said, you don't. I'm my cool Greg.

The Joker horror movie will be a gritty, grounded, hard-boiled crime film set in early '80s Gotham City.

That was an origin story. And that's why I feel you didn't work. Killing Joke was an origin story. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. But I'm, yeah, yeah. That wasn't my argument that was making there. In the fact of comic books of Joker's out of Arkham. Now he's got ways people. And now they're working. Then they took over this. It's like, wait, am I detracting from the origin story, which I didn't have a problem with in it? Really? I'm just left active. Like, has any of this work like comics? I love them. Comics are great.

Mace Windu is getting a five issue that guys, and it took miniseries. Very excited about this. Takes place during the the Clone Wars era, which is an era that the the Marvel Comics have not delved too deep into. We got the Obi-Wan & Anakin series for a while and now that was alright, probably on the lower side of my favorites when it comes to the mini series. But the Star Wars mini series have been pretty damn good, okay, overall.
