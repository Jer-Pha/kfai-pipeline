I've never loved her more than when she got to the end of Game of Thrones. She's like, \"It's just overrated.\" And I hugged her and kissed her. I'm like, \"This is why we're married.\" Honest, Greg, it's one of those things. I'm just trying my hardest to just buy my. Jen confronted me about it a couple days ago.

Uh, but she's trying to explain to me why she thinks that Game of Thrones is just okay. And I just like, I just, I just can't have that conversation. Okay, here's, here's, here's where I'm at with it. Um, I love watching it. I love the ceremony of watching the show. It's Sunday. Like Sunday is our pasta day. I pasta day. So, so I cook my pasta.

The house smells great all day. And then it's, it's, you know, start off with John Oliver, uh, kind of get a good little kick off, a little palate cleanser. And then when it, when it, 'cause it's you, the lights down. And then Pam and I, we make up our own lyrics every time a **** thr do the same. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Just, just something you can do with a little nine-year-old. Do you remember when she had no name? That's what that, I mean, that's where she, all of that when she was, when she was at the temple and people are going to scream, \"I can't called blah.\" I get it.

This, this is a case where I was arguing with some people on Twitter about this. It's not just the nerds, you know what I mean? I feel like if this, if a show is widely loved and is constantly nominated for awards and and is, you know, highly thought of among critics, I think that's a sign of a good show.

It's the same reason why people rubberneck when they go down the highway and they see a car crash. We as people want to be able to view and experience death, fear, love, all of these things from a safe distance, from sex, from a safe distance. That's why we watch horror films.

If she can find love, it's really hard for her. I can. Um, it's the same reason why people watch anything that has to do with weight loss. There's a catharsis that people go through and they're on the journey with people. And even though they're not necessarily doing it, I've seen people be really inspired. That's why one of the best and worst things that ever happened was, um, The Biggest Loser. It's because it inspired a generation of people to really get active and go, \"I can do it.

And that's what the show was and it canceled. So it's the same thing that happened when all the people that, um, like all the televangelists started questioning whether or not there was a God because they found that through this guy. So if this guy is bad, is God bad? And there's no separation between the two.

They, they still, if the anachronistic version of this would be like, they still play Scrabble together. This is the thing that gets her to come all the way from Venice or to get my wife to go all the way down there to visit her. And this is their common ground. It's the excuse to hang out. Sure.

But like what's become a ritual for us is every Monday when Bachelor's on, it's me and my girlfriend sitting there. But it is the Mystery Science Theater. It is she that's cool. She en, I mean, she's in it. But like she enjoys me kind of making my dumbass comments and talking **** to the characters. And like, you know, like they'll be an edit that's so clearly telegraphed.

I've been saying that since before I met her. And then I met her, I was like, \"Damn.\" When you saw her from afar, you're like, \"I can't talk to that woman. She's too attractive.\" She got me hooked on The Bachelor. So, all right, it all worked out. And all worked out. Yeah, you guys, I talked so much **** going into it.

But you didn't acknowledge it. Neither to his. He's way taller and better looking than me though. No, that's not true. There will it was Ray Bradbury. So sorry. \"There Will Come Soft Rains.\" Um, there's a it was a from just a literary standpoint, it's a beautiful story because there's no physical character. There's no like there's no person human character in the story. You're going through this house as it's automated and it's like making the pot of coffee and it's doing all these things.

My favorite thing about the Alexa or about Google Home or about any of these things is parties because you'll be at a party, everyone gets progressively drunker and it just turns into this thing of, \"Hey! Hey! Okay Google, play!\" They just say some ****. You just see what happens. And it's just people screaming over each other, \"Tell me who my father is!\" I highly recommend it. Oh jeez.
