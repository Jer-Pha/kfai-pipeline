I'm Greg Miller, and you know I have a show called #CookingWithGreggy, and I used Blue Apron when I started to fall in love with cooking. Why? Because it's simple. It's not, it's not, it's not going to get in your head and confuse you. All you know what you do, you sign up, you pick the meals you want, they send you the meals. It comes pre-packaged ingredients, it comes with instructions. You go step by step, they got little pictures, you figure it all out.

I've been playing a whole bunch of stuff. Yeah, I can finally talk about most of it too because we've been under embargo for everything. All three of us played Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Yeah, the review is up at YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. I hope this is, let me just, let me go, Andy, I hope this is a little bit more laid back than the Uncharted review.

Now they want you on everything. Is the fourth chair on everything? Wise? Maybe, and everything. So they finally got their wish, they can shut up now. Speaking of Andy, get off my back about **** playful. And speaking of come, ah, there was a Vargas Party Mode where we both made come jokes within two seconds of, no, not even, it was like on top, it was on the top of each other.

I'm playing Uncharted. Reviews up. Is where you fall in with Uncharted? That topic, the show we're in, talk about Uncharted. There's a lot of Uncharted in the top of the show's up in the show. We'll be discussing kind of the $40 price point share of Uncharted, and, and because now that the reviews are officially out, we get to see everyone else's. A lot of hullabaloo about how this game is being reviewed because it's being compared to the other Uncharted thread. It's just, you'll see, but we'll talk about that right. Coolest, I won't out. So we plan Uncharted. I played City Skylines the first night that I got a code for it. I had that and Sonic Mania at the same time. I went back and forth between them.

I like, you know, since today, I like kind of games. I champion, had a good time. My first city failed miserably, so I'm excited to get in there and learn from my mistakes because it is a little bit different, but it is also, it's a little bit different in terms of like the way the mechanics and systems work together, but then it is super similar to what SimCity was/is, and so that was a little off-putting. Me, as I have somebody played Cities when it first came out and haven't come back for any of it to get the updated version or, you know, this news console version, it feels a lot like SimCity, and that actually is hampering my desire to go back",

Sonic, I'm sure you guys love a whole bunch of Sonic impressions of stuff since then, but the big thing I've been playing that I can finally talk about is Madden. Yeah, Madden 18 code that sarcastically real. You should know Madden. Okay, gives you know a lot of people, and they know when, when they showed that story mode often in E3, well, it reminded me a lot of the 2K's MyCareer stuff, right? And I love that stuff.

We ran through the games, you know, we are excited about coming up, and if you're not into Madden or you don't care about football, stick with me because I'm not going to talk about like the nuts and bolts bars. I do want to talk about Longshot, but, you know, when I was like, \"Are you making fun of me?\" Because it's this weird thing of like liking a sports game in our industry, and the social circles is kind of like the opposite of like when you're, you know, growing up in high school, the jocks are the cool kids.

Yeah, first we'll have, I'm going to the Kennedy, what a joke. Champions Gate is the joke. Yeah, exactly. First, yeah, I mean, David Robinson, I lost Andy, John Stockton, did give him away. Uh, but no, so Peter Brown was like, \"Oh, how much he in a plane?\" Like my whole thing is, I used to do, Bobby, oh, Let's Plays back at IGN. I love doing this because it was an excuse to play it, and I had a couple friends and who have now moved away, like Sean Norton, who I used to be, we'd get together, used to every week, we do it usually like once a year where we got together and played hella Madden. So it was always fun, it was always great, and so I got the code. I was excited more than anything about Longshot because it was that story mode they showed at E3.",

I like that there's an end to it, whereas with Madden, when you play Madden, it is, I'm going to go in, I'm going to do dynasty, I'm going to do the season thing, and it never ends. It never, ever stops, and there never feels like a great point to jump out. I jumped into Longshot mode, completed it last night. I did over nights, but you can easily do it in one giant night. I want to say it was between four and five hours. It's a little hard because, you know, I think I put 45 minutes in the first night, then I played a bit, but broke for dinner last night. Doesn't sound like so four to five hours long. Longshot is incredibly special. It is one of those things that I, I wasn't, when I'm playing it, like you start easing into it. It's very much like, \"Well, what is this going to be?\"",

Now play two high school games and then move into, play two high school games, go to college, and come from college, go to Madden.\" You know, you're the all-star. Longshot isn't that, and it also isn't, so here's the biggest praise I can give it to you. I know a lot of you guys don't care about sports. EA would be silly not to take Longshot in six months to however long they want to and put it up by itself as a piece of DLC because it really is, hey, what if Telltale made a sports game?

Yes, but it's super light. It because at first what it is is I was telling you about the first night I came in and I was like, \"I played a plane, a plane.\" There was no sports, there was nothing, and it was just choices and decisions because the story here is that you're this kid named Dev, right? You, you have your friend Colt, played by Scott Porter, what up, Scott Porter, friend of the show.

Cathey from House of Cards, people known from what is it, Moonlight, Moonlight, oh, Mahershala Ali, oh yeah, exactly, exactly. Ah, he, Mahershala, he's the father. No, no, yeah, there's, it's, oh, it is Mahershala Ali. Yeah, Mahershala. Um, he's the father figure. Yeah, I mean, no spoilers here, he dies, you know, so like you're, it, it gets this whole narrative yet we've, you know, that he dies early on though, so I'm not spoiling that.

It's not that at all. It is this very not grounded. There's leaps of logic and, you know, it's video games and sports and all these like great breaks for this kid, but it is the fact of like you played a year at University of Texas. You bailed out. You like, you just quit the team. Everybody hates you for it. The University of Texas hates you for it. When your father died, you just walked away from it all, and now you're trying to get back into it. So you're going into it with all this baggage on you. You're a lapsed football person.

Yeah, cool. Ha ha. What did he go to UT with you? Yeah, of course. Yeah, Olmec ointment. Scott Porter. Well, yeah, they rip it off. I wonder if you, I did for exactly. We know he's not accorded a wide receiver. Okay, yeah, yeah. You're in massive Texas, small town football life, you know what I mean?

Yeah, and Colt's doing the whole like he's live streaming if he walks in and talking and like he's like, \"Hey, you know, pose for a photo with me.\" And you guys are already late, so like pops up is the choice like, \"Do you wait for, do you not wait for it, or do you take the photo, you know, demand to go in?\" And then you make those choices, and that starts going into like your scouting report because is how you handle yourself off field because like when you're being scouted, it is how fast you run, well, you know, how great you high you can jump, but it is also, are you a hothead?

It's interesting, it's well acted, it's poignant. Like there was a point that I don't spoil, not that I mean, you can imagine where some of these pain, not pain points, but like touching moments are going to be of like where I'm playing and Jen was watching for long. She's like, \"**** like Madden coming with the feels.\" Like you're not, I mean, like it was actually telling you something, and it's so well done, and it's that same thing of like that's exciting. We see video games all the time that have articles, Scott Porter's in it, or not, not Scott, but like this famous guy, you know, is in it, you know, the guys from the famous person, you know, is in it, and they're in for two seconds, and that's it, and it's just",

Like when you finished Longshot, and like the credits are rolling, they run all the footage of them making the game, and it's all of them in the ping-pong ball suits with their faces lit up in the camera. It's like, you know what they do for Uncharted, what they do for The Last of Us. Wow. And that was the thing where I text is kind of like, \"Holy ****, you actually got to hang out with Dan Marino?\" Because like Dan Marino, at the end, towards the end of the story, like comes in is like your mentor or whatever, and it's like, \"Holy find.\" He's like, \"Yeah, he showed this and he did that.\" And it's like the story is interesting.

To my knowledge, this is the first time there's ever been a female character in Madden who's played football. Like you guys do a pickup game with the Army, and this woman plays, and she's awesome, and they make all these comments about how fast she is, and she's like beating Colt and stuff, and it's like that's **** rad, and like there's a cool like, like spark between them that's really well done, and actively like that.

Like the handshakes will sometimes get hidden by like, you know, the like widescreen because I'm, it's a pain to animate hands that are doing stuff that your game doesn't do. Why would you ever knew that? And it's the same thing of like there's a couple different times where you, as Dev, walk in to these like, you know, giant arenas, people cheering, or you're going for a press conference, and it's always filmed just at you, right?

Like so there's little things like that of like, \"Oh, like BioWare would have done this differently.\" And I know they somehow helped with this or whatever. Yeah, you said their names are in the credits, but it's not like it's there, it's not a triple-A BioWare game, what I mean by that. Um, however, like when you get to the gameplay of it, the first parts of it, like where other than making choices and see how all interacts and seeing your scouting grade go up and you're, you know, performance go down, it's you go in and it's, it's quick-time, right? So it's like, are you saying snaps in the field that screw around and it's teaching the things, and it's like, \"All right, back with, you know, the left stick three times over.\"",

It's like, \"Oh, cool, like am I ever going to play real Madden in this?\" And the answer is no, you never get full on, \"Let's play a game, hey, do this.\" It is, you do get to, \"Hey, there are a few downs, let's get you here. You have to win this game because it's how you're having a flash battle.\" And it's also totally dumbed down to the point of like, \"I'm out there, I'm just waiting in the pocket, waiting in the pocket.\" And then finally there's what they want me to do or the breaks open, and it's, I don't, I think anybody could get in there and do it. The pocket is a football term, not. My apology. Got hot? How hot is it? It's not going to depend if there's a blitz coming in. It's get pretty hot those people",

You got some trouble getting middle linebacker back so you can have reasons. Maybe, I mean, that's a call back ahead lunch. Those of you who may not. So moving out of our love today, I think so.

Mmm, which couldn't be found at you cause last Kinda Funny Games. They can thank you, Jordan. I'm not wondering how to assess the game based on the experiences. It's clear that Lost Legacy still offers the great gameplay the series is known for, but the story and the world building is a little lacking. Please to get among the weaker games in this series such as Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and Uncharted: Golden Abyss. Is Lost Legacy a disappointment because it doesn't meet the expectations of Uncharted 1 through 4? Is it even appropriate to suggest that the game reviews good or great is a disappointment if it fails to innovate in its gameplay or it fails to deliver an excellent story?

Thank you for your input, guys. In addition, this read in the comments of our review and read the intern app thread and it reviews all over the world. Yeah, a lot of the comments are being like, this is supposed to be DLC. Why are you reviewing this like it's a real game? Like, why are you comparing it under other Uncharted? What do you think, Greg? It's a complicated issue. Uh, Jordan does a great job explaining some of it there. There was a person in our YouTube comments last night when it went live who is like, I just feel like you guys are being completely unfair. This is clearly DLC. It shouldn't be reviewed as such.

And so I think when you're talking about, it's the same way Tomb Raider gets compared to Uncharted or any other third-person action, we're telling a story game gets compared to Uncharted. Now I was talking to a friend about it who was like, man, you know, you guys came off more negative in this review than I was expecting you to. And I was like, well, we got in front of it. I'm like, I think the problem is we're comparing something in the same universe from the same developer with the same characters to four games that really were industry defining in a lot of different ways in terms of like what the course is and what the **** bar for video games and console gaming is and what",

You can that, that's why I think it's so interesting that we come off negative and quotes. We definitely sound like, God, it's good. It's great. No, it's great. Even you, is there's a little bit in the review of us trying to convince ourselves or trying to figure out where we land. But I think it's because the, it's such a slippery slope and the footing so unsure when you're talking about the fact of, well, it is just DLC and they did just turn it around in the year, but it is this, but it is Uncharted and is Naughty Dog in a bullet.

That's what you're talking about is like a giant overall, let's look at the video game landscape industry, what you want to play and how it all can also. I don't know if it's 90%, but we said, but you know, you **** said it's kind of just, I think it's 90% in. And I think then that's, that's the one way to look at it with that lens on. And then you put the other lens on it, let's compare it now to the other Uncharted. And I think that's where you get into it. And another person I was talking to about all this and I've seen kick around, it's like, oh, well, you know, it is DLC, it is this. And it's like, no, it's not.

And this is, it's going to be, it's bigger than we thought it was going to be. It is a $40 experience. We're pressing it on a disc and we're putting out and do these different things. For me, it's interesting. What's fascinating about it is the fact that I don't know if it's the way we've been following it because we're doing Games Daily and doing just E3 coverage and stuff where they were making a big deal like, this is a decision DLC. This is a full-fledged thing. Boom! And that got in our head a bit in terms of like what to expect from it. But then even to compare it to Infamous First Light where people were like, oh man, this is, I, you know, Infamous First Light didn't get compared to this that neither.

And I start getting into it. I'm like, why doesn't this, what were the inconsistencies there? And why I'm not doing the same way? No, well, she's part of it, sure. But it's the fact that First Light, her touches powers are completely different than Delsin's. So already, even though I'm exploring the same city and doing similar things, it feels different where this is like Chloe's powers in quotes, you are that analogous to Nathan Drake's.

And I think I'd have to get in and correct me if I'm wrong. I can check out while you guys talk 'cause I've gone on way too long and I apologize. Is the fact that that was a game that was clearly DLC, even though he would, it was DLC, it was standalone. I want to say it was 19 bucks, but I'm gonna double-check that now. I think this old DLC thing, the labeling of what these games are, gets really complicated. Second year, Limbo was on the wall. Limbo, I think, was one of the first games to usher in the idea of people who like, do we call it DLC?

When DLC started, it was just like character packs and skins for things and colored changes for a Street Fighter or, you know, whatever it was, microtransaction stuff. There was that. But then it was an article, now there's substantial single-player content being added. And it goes back to the PC days of expansion packs like StarCraft and then Brood War or whatever, or Diablo. And they had hit, it's like, or WoW, you know, and all that stuff. But then we get to a point where I feel like we started getting that level of expansion pack on consoles. Examples include Mario Kart 8 and how much content it added for its tracks. BioShock: Minerva's Den, which is that is totally an example of",

Yeah, there's a sound one thing that took the system of Uncharted, but did something different with it. And I feel like we're at a point now with things like First Light and and with Uncharted and all that was like, we don't need to label them and compare them any differently than there's video games. And it's like comparing it to its $40 price point, I think is the most, you know, important factor to keep in mind. And real quick, 15 bucks right now for Infamous First Light. That's not a sale. I would assume that was the price it was it launched. I've been able to dig up an older thing. I feel like, I feel like Naughty Dog was sort of in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation because they, when it was coming out again, what Greg was mentioning earlier, like we were expecting a small three",

By the way, and and then they said, well, you know what, guys, this is actually a lot bigger, right? So they set that expectation that this is going to be a much bigger game and this is like its own standalone video game. And then, but I feel like they would, if I feel like they had to say that in order to justify their $40 price. So it's, it's like, well, do we set the expectation low, but then try to sell for 40 bucks? Or do we, you know, why, why? Yeah, yeah. And that's the thing. It is longer. It is this. It is longer than the other ones we're bringing up. It, you know, there's more to this game at seven and a half hours for me to beat. I'm going to go back and play it again. I'm crushing to do that.

But I enjoyed what I did. Left Behind, it's the same way. I played through it once and I never went back and I enjoyed the story and I was done with it. Both of those exceeded the expectations I had for what we were promised, if that makes it right. You know, they were DLC even under standalone.

We talked about this a little bit at the end of our review discussion yesterday, but what should this game cost? Like, do we think that this game is worth $40 in like, all right, sure, it has the multiplayer suite and all that, but you got to assume that most people already have Uncharted 4. I mean, if you don't, got to assume that like that, I don't know how much of an incentive that senses that is if they're not already interested and they haven't already invested in it.

I would be super down for that. Like with just different characters and give me different side stories. I feel like the reason I'm most down on it at the end of the day is the Nadine character.
