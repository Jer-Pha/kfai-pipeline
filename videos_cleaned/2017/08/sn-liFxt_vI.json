It's a new flavor of LaCroix you're trying. Oh, it is Tangerine. I haven't had it before. How is it? I am a big fan. Yeah, I've been widening my horizons with this. You you yeah, you've been staying in the lane on the LaCroix business too long. Yeah, you're finally breaking out. I was I was a Lime boy for so long time. Well, it's kind of like when you grew up and you had way too much Frosted Flakes. Frosted Flakes, I mean, dynamite shoutouts. You got an argued in Frosted Flakes are great, but they reaches a point I realize I had these too much. I could never have Frosted Flakes again. Be fine. Yeah, it's overdone. I feel like I did that with Lime LaCroix. No, I need to get all these other things. I'm just kind of warm up to him. Things that I would never like Peach Pear comes to mind. Sure, that doesn't sound like something Tim Gettys",

Is that what it's called? Joanna now? I think I don't know. Okay, that's weird. So like did how are they rolling out new flavor? No, no, no, no, isn't it new? It's new to me. Okay, if I haven't had it. Okay, how many more flavors are left for you to taste, you think? Probably like five, G's. Yeah, can't wait. Don't worry. I'm right. I'll do it. All right, we should do a taste test. Sounds like a good good gog topic. If you didn't know, gentlemen, this it's Kinda Funny Games Daily each and every weekday on a variety of platforms.

It's post I can edit and so yes, PUBG, which that was my first time playing the game ever, and I fell in love with it there. But what I think is really cool about it is that this Let's Play is our side of it, but there's also on YouTube.com/LetsPlay, it's us versus the entire community. So, you can see a beautifully edited version where it's Achievement Hunter, Funhaus, and Alfredo, who's now part of the Achievement Hunter, but wasn't at the time, and all those guys, Game Attack, all them, and it's super freaking.

Great job done in might. And then you got to keep your voices down back there. I bet the mic was picking up you a Jabber John beforehand. Number one, Tim Gettys. Yeah, Sonic Mania doesn't suck.

Mario Odyssey didn't blow my mind E3, but Breath of the Wild didn't either, and we all know how that turned out. Sure, we'll see. So, I'm not gonna, you know, count my chickens before they hatch or whatever. But Crash Bandicoot sounds super wild. That's great. Yeah, Sonic Mania reviewing super well.

I got to the final level, but I didn't have time to actually play through that. I have now beaten the game. I haven't no hundred percent of it. I still need to go back. I got all the Chaos Emeralds and all that. But it is undeniably the best Sonic video game in the existence. 2D, 3D, it doesn't matter. Like this is such a tribute to everything that makes Sonic the Hedgehog awesome. And it's just like I'm blown away by the game. I keep thinking about it, keep want to play it. I played through it on PlayStation 4. Can't wait to get it on Switch, and that's why I really want to dive into it and then totally 100% it. It is fantastic.

However, if I am 50/50 on a game and I am not sure I want it or tossing it up between two games, the trophy list and effort to Platinum makes this decision for me. I know trophy hunters only make up a small percentage of play, but you would think that Sony would do everything to retain the PlayStation player base, especially with games from third-party studios available on other platforms. What gives? Well, the big Sony has much to do with it, right? That would be a sailor call. I I place this blame solely on Sony.

Oh, so we need you this because you're downloadable games. You don't need a Platinum. Okay, here our show fees passing back. Now we got a game. But it is a trophy list the same as the Achievement list on Xbox. Uh, it was silver in that out to a thousand points though on Xbox, whereas the PlayStation one has the Platinum. Remember? Okay, one's being put as a lesson. Yes, got it. Yeah, so that's the that's the thing we get caught up in all the time.

Yeah, but this type of thing would be over looks like I feel like those people would fight for it unless there's not PlayStation. And that's what exactly happened. I I'm assuming. I don't know.

My problem is that this we're talking about with PlayStation and the how tone-deaf and how the system is all **** up over there is that somebody gets that trophy list back and looks at it, inputs it.

Telefonica, so you're wrong that Forces is only gonna be $40. Mm-hmm. So, I think that there's an interesting conversation to be had about these mascot games and the price point of Sonic Mania being $20, Crash Bandicoot being $40, Sonic Forces potentially being $40. Like that and Ratchet & Clank a couple years ago, yep, being $40. I think that helps sell these and get them out there to proliferate the brand and all that. And I think that having a Switch version on store shelves would sell like hotcakes. And that is just such an easy game. Some especially with the attach rate that we've seen with the Switch with every game so far. Like what's Arms selling over a million copies? What would Sonic Mania sell at $20 physically?

Oh God, Greg, on Thursday's show, you and Andrea had the audacity to say you agreed with IllFonic's decision to remove team-killing from Friday the 13th's newest patch. True Friday the 13th fans like myself are furious about the decision as removing the ability to kill a teammate is going to ruin the game experience far more than getting murdered by a counselor.

Everyone, the biggest problem with this game is the large number of people teaming up with Jason players, hoarding and refusing to use repair items, or people simply blocking a doorway preventing you from escaping. All of these problems are solved by team killing, and with the inability to do so, they will now become more common problems. How else am I supposed to prevent my fellow campers from telling Jason my position or getting Chad to move out of the way so I can check the next room of the lodge without using deadly force? I don't condone killing players for fun, but sometimes you need to blow a counselor's head off as Tommy Jarvis in order to actually make some real progress.

You see hope for that, but I don't you ever see them as prevalently because the set on the console, you usually need a name behind them. Cities has that name now because it's been going for so long.
