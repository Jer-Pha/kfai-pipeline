No one backing this up that this is a good decision. I, has this ever happened before to my knowledge? No. I've never heard of DLC edition splitting a Platinum. Right. I have, of course. Hey, what the way this should have worked is now because what they've set, what they've said publicly, and maybe this is it. Let me just, it's so frustrating, so anger. It just because they just don't respect the **** PlayStation landscape or trophies and just God, they understand what Platinums are all are. But here's the problem.

But they haven't said that at the time we all heard about this, which seems like a slap in the face to you. Right. So it's just what the ****. You, this is the equivalent of them hiding the Platinum behind DLC. It's a wall to get a Platinum trophy. And so the problem, of course, is that what this should have been done.

What they need to do either at two separate review lists. Here's your Life is Strange: Before the Storm Standard Edition trophy list without that trophy. Here's your Life is Strange Deluxe Edition with that trophy. Or here's your Life is Strange: Before the Storm Platinum list, no trophy.

Do you think that maybe the game was a bit, imagine a world in which there was one version of the game. Maybe there was one version of the game. Yeah. And then at a certain stage, they were like, oh, well, let's maybe most people want to play that. We need to hit this price point that's like closer to $16. That's like, we'll make the full version 25. But like, you know, that's for extra people. The the core version of the game is going to be this one there.

I would assume to some extent that's the correct thing. Then when they sat down to do this, they were like, well, we need to build this. We want to do this. This is the Chloe story we're telling. Right. Because Max is you. I mean, like, Farewell, as soon as they announced it, it's like your final time to play as Max. Right. With this very well. I was like, oh, clearly it's when you Max leaves town, leaves Arcadia Bay. Right. And so now they've shown like the the trophy art is up for it. It's very much a, you know, young Max and Chloe. So you assumed they had this story to tell about Chloe. And then we'll hope we make the Deluxe Edition special. Oh, what if we made an episode or chapter whenever I put it right there?

What aren't you getting in that pack? So because it's a pretty big size, ten bucks. Yeah, yeah. Well, jump. So what you get is you get the bonus episode Farewell, which again, I imagine is going to be ten minutes, 15 minutes. You know, I mean, I think it's gonna be one scene of you saying goodbye is Max to Chloe. And I'm guessing on that, it's gonna be outfits. You get like, it's a little bit confusing.

Now he said the focus is on games and that triple-A exclusives are coming. To me it is apparent that the reason they are there are a lack of exclusives as of late into the Xbox, a lack of it console exclusives so late into the Xbox One's life is that Phil is bringing his vision to Xbox, a vision of Xbox to fruition.

Yes, the Xbox One X is the most powerful console ever but as someone who doesn't own a 1080p screen it doesn't really benefit me that much and I won't be picking it up.
