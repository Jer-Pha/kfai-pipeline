It is my birthday today. How does it feel like to be 21? You know, I've been waiting for the chance to legally buy beer in a bar for a really long time. I mean, I have this amazing fake ID that's been doing me pretty well, but now that I get to use my real ID, I'm going to make everyone card me all day. Exactly. Jose Louis Cilas wrote in and said, \"Not a question per se, but praise. I just wanted to say happy birthday to Andrea. She's a unique voice in the game and tech space without fear to speak her mind and always with an insightful and interesting point of view. Thankful for the addition to Kinda Funny and always excited for the future. Happy Birthday, Andrea.\" Oh, that was very kind. Thank you very much. What are the plans? What are the big birthday plans? Well, um, I celebrated with the girls on our stream last week.",

Well, um, I celebrated with the girls on our stream last week. They made me a cake and sang and gave me cute little gifts, so that was fun. And then today, uh, my husband is taking me out for a fancy dinner. He wouldn't tell me where. He just said, \"It's going to be an adventure.\" Oh, okay. Maybe said like top of a mountain. You got to climb up a mountain. I mean, hey, it will burn the calories that I'm going to eat, I guess, so I don't feel guilty about it. No, don't feel guilty about what, what? So what did you do last night? What did you play? What you been up to? Um, last night, get more night in. Yes, of. So we went out to dinner. My good friend, Ray Carsillo, from EGM is in town for a preview event, um, at an undisclosed company. And, um, he reached out and was like, \"Hey, let's hang out.\" And I was like, \"Ray, you're the best. Yeah, let's do it.\" So we had, um, dinner at a Japanese, um, barbecue place.",

First one, perfect, nailed it. They had to do it twice more. Took me another 30 minutes, 30, 45 minutes to get it done, 'cause I'm terrible at that mini game. But it doesn't matter. It's behind me. It's Platinum. It's great. Now you can start P. Why are you so resistant? It's not that I'm, 'cause I'm not excited tonight. I like, I was happy it happened because as soon as it happened, I looked in the email and had my Tacoma Xbox One code. And I'm like, \"F stair, are you excited?

Over on Nintendo's Facebook, they have posted, \"We appreciate the incredible anticipation that exists for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Super NES Classic Edition system. You, we, and can confirm that it will be made available for pre-order by various retailers late this month. A significant amount of additional systems will be shipped to stores on launch day and throughout the balance of the calendar year.\" Significant amount. What do you think that actually means? Who the hell knows? There's a reason they're not giving you any numbers, 'cause it's going to be the exact same situation it was with NES Classic, and it's going to be a nightmare for anybody who wants this thing.

Many of our store associates and guests have asked for this. We have heard their requests and are making an adjustment to our previous position on the topic.\" For context, three years ago, GameStop announced plans to close all of its stores on Thanksgiving, telling press the move was, quote, \"Out of respect for company employees and their families.\" In 2014, the company told ThinkProgress, quote, \"At GameStop, we often use the phrase 'protect the family' in reference to our business. A large part of that means to us is to not open any of our GameStops, Simply Mac, blah, blah, blah, locations on Thanksgiving Day out of respect for our associates and their families and friends.

Enjoy this time with your loved ones and we'll see you on Black Friday.\" GameStop remained closed on Thanksgiving 2015 and 2016. This year, the company appears to have a change of heart. Continue on a little bit later in the same Kotaku piece. \"It's been a rough year for GameStop, which has seen shares tank as the video game industry embraces the digital market.\" I'm then pulling this from The Wall Street Journal. \"GameStop's net income decreased from $65.8 million in the year ago quarter to $59 million.\" Then Andrea add in, \"But GameStop posted an earnings beat on a 3.8% increase of net growth.\" Back to the Kotaku piece. \"Thanksgiving lands in the middle of one of the busiest seasons for gaming as many big publishers race to release their hot fall titles in time for Christmas, which will be the prime sales season for GameStop.

Uh, parentheses, the SNES Classic and Switch will no doubt be large parts of the sales drivers as well. Andrea, what's your read on the situation? So I have a couple of things to say about this. First, I need to be the person to admit that a few years ago, in 2015, when they, um, originally said that they were going to close for Thanksgiving, and that was really the first year that we saw stores open on the actual day of Thanksgiving. Try to get ahead of Black Friday for Black Friday, right? Like, um, as when I say day, I mean not like midnight, I mean like 6:00 p.m., uh, the day of. And I had echoed a lot of other people's sentiments that I don't think it's right that Thanksgiving stores, stores are opening that early on Thanksgiving. I am a longtime Black Friday shopper.

I used to get up at like 3:00 in the morning. You seem like someone who would terrify me on Black Friday. I can see you out there with your. No, my strategy was always to never go for electronics on Black Friday. I always went for clothes 'cause almost every store is 50 to 75% off on Black Friday. So it's easy to repopulate your wardrobe and it's not as crazy as like trying to buy like $500 TV or whatever, right? Um, so I've always been a person who shops on Black Friday. Um, but I thought, you know what, like 6:00 p.m. is too early. You're really cutting the day for people who want to spend a little time with their family. You open at like 10:00 p.m. or later, then at least people have the bulk of the day 'cause after, after like 7:00, you're all like, lay the couch drunk, you know, you're food coma, you're, you're not really doing much anyway.

You're just chilling if you want to. Kid's going. Yeah, so I need to start by saying like, I took a public stance that like, I didn't like the stores were open on Thanksgiving. Then today, um, and then today, Patrick Klepek made a tweet about how he thinks it's gross that GameStop is opening. And I got into it a little bit with people in a thread because as we've seen over the last two years, pretty much every retailer is now open on Thanksgiving Day. There's like no stopping it. And Amazon obviously is open all the time too. And even though you're not physically going into an Amazon store, there are people working at Amazon on Thanksgiving to process your online order. Sure. I know, I know a lot of their system is automated, but there are still human beings that work that holiday to accommodate that influx of retail. So my position is, I, as somebody.",

So my position is, I, as somebody who worked in the service industry for a very long time, has worked many, many holidays in my lifetime because when you work in the service industry, it's expected that, hey, people want booze, they want food on holidays. And so you, as the person who's serving them the booze and food, have to work on the holiday. And I actually enjoyed working on holidays because it was some of my biggest money-making days. And it was a great way for me to escape my family if I didn't want to see them and, you know, make some money and then I could hang with my family on a different day. So there's a lot of people out there like me that want to work on a holiday. So, you know, 'cause like, here's the thing, I, I worked retail for summer at Walmart and Petland job too.

Then the GameStop thing of, \"Many of our store associates and, and, and guests have asked for this.\" You think the store associates have asked to be open? I think it's up for debate what \"many\" means. How many people are asking for hours? I don't know. But I do know that GameStop incentivizes stores to sell as much as possible and they get bonuses and rewards for being the top earners in their region. And in order to do that, what better day to make excellent sales numbers than Thanksgiving Day, right before Black Friday, when every other retailer is now open? So they have to compete with Walmart, with Target, with Best Buy, and of course, we, you know, online retailers as well. And so if they're closed, if the store, if the company is mandating that they be closed on Thanksgiving, then they're.",

And so if they're closed, if the store, if the company is mandating that they be closed on Thanksgiving, then they're automatically taking away a giant portion of sales that now those people are going to go to other retailers and get the deal at Target or or Walmart instead of GameStop. So I, I see it from that side. Do I also see it from the other side that unfortunately some people are now going to be forced to work on a holiday that they didn't want to have to work? Absolutely. And like, that's hopefully something that could be avoided depending on, you know, you working out shifts with people at your job. I had to do that sometimes when I was bartending and I needed to get like New Year's Eve off, which is like when you're a bartender, you never get New Year's Eve off to party. You're always working.

I mean, and listen, you're allowed to, to have your opinions. If you think it's gross, you can think it's gross. The internet, I don't know if you are, but to think it's gross just because GameStop's doing it, it, it just rings a little false to me because all of the other retailers are doing it.

And for me, going there, of course, as a journalist, I represents both sides of this story and I never put my opinion in it. But honestly, a human being inside what I'm thinking of is like, the solution to this problem is simple. Don't shop at Walmart. Shop at the local stores.
