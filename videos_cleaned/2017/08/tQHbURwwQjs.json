That's a tab. That means that Batman has to learn to work together with his fellow superheroes. Quote, he's put in this position of having to reach out, find other people, convincing them to do something. Affleck explains, part of the drama of the movie is the question of whether or not the team's going to come together. It's very difficult. It's very different from the tenor of the line.

Departed a little bit from the traditional Batman, says Affleck. He started out with all this rage directed at Superman because of his co-workers who would died in the fight. Superman hand with thought. Affleck, most of the heroes ensuing actions were defined by barely repressed fury. In contrast with Batman, we meet in Justice League. He was holding on to a lot of anger in a little bit of an irrational way. Affleck says, whereas this is a much more traditional Batman. He's heroic.
