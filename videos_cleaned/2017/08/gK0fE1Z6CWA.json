You said on the show before your drinking problem is that you always said on the show, you said in half for you and instead of, okay, yeah, we talked about that because I really, I think about that recently, but it was in dinner.

I'm sorry to let everyone down, but it's been a while now. You're not going to stop drinking soda though? No, but it's like it's definitely slowing me down, good. And I'm just like, I can convert. I think it's good that happened. That's actually very common because um, you know, I know people who go in detox diets and they just, they stay away from sugar and then they have a bit of cereal or something and they look, oh my god, you know, like you get so used to, yeah, and like salt free diets that like your body will just like freak out.

I'll start eating it and it'll taste salty, but then I'll also taste the sweetness like the natural sugars that are in a nut. It's pretty fascinating. So if you have like sugar Froot Loops, would you be wired like a child? I know that I'd be wired. I, I think that I would definitely. So I started, I've also been not drinking a lot of artificial sweeteners, so I've been giving myself like a Diet Coke here and there, but nothing to do crazy and I noticed the difference now and how I feel, yeah, which is a very, which I normally a lot of people don't pay attention to like, like one",

I was unnatural and processed. And so when I have Diet Coke, I definitely feel my body just feels like I gave it something that it doesn't necessarily know what to do with reason. You know, granted now I should say when I drink a Diet Coke, I don't drink a normal sized Diet Coke. I will go to movie theater and get the big gulp, okay?

I think it was The Wolverine, the one with I was in Japan. And I was like, bro, and we got into this big battle and somehow that escalated to him challenging me to a Jackman-off, which, which means that whichever one of us looks more like Hugh Jackman from The Wolverine. I genuinely like, well, I was like, this is pretty fun. I like when I met you, I was like, this dude's in pretty decent shape. And like when you said Jackman-off, I'm like, it's gotta be Hugh.
