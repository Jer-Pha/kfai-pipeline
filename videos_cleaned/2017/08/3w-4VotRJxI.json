This Kevin Coello, that guy Greg Miller, that guy Andy Cortez, and over here we have the producer, Producer Nick. I enjoyed it. Today we are playing Drawful. Why are you in such a hurry to get through the foreplay? Come on, I want to get straight into it, get it like Ice Cream. All right, cool, we're gonna get right into it. It was bigger. I do see Andy's lover. That's me, everybody. I don't know how I feel about that. Yeah, you are. It's Andy you're talking about, though, right? No, it's you, Candy Andy. Here we go. It's Drawful time. Is it giving us instructions? F***, you know how to play. Time to... Oh, no, f***. Oh, God, this game is too hard. Well, I'm glad you're having fun on this Party Mode. As always, can you write words? No, not feeling real confident about this, I'll be honest with you. Oh, so I... I could do this perfect picture of myself, a Disneyland caricature artist. Oh, that looks... That's very inappropriate.

That's actually what it is. You got great teeth, Andy. Let's go here. What is it? Lasso the Ginger, Wheelchair Olympics, Wedding Chocolate Fountain, Couples Therapy, or Pervert About to Stalk Two Children on a Bike? Which one is it, guys? I ended up choosing Lasso the Ginger. Ha, you f***ing got you, Andy. God damn it. It said it was hard to draw. Damn you. I don't like that you're Andy's lover. I don't know who was winning then, 'cause anyone could be Andy's lover. We all are in some way. Give it to me. Yes, f***ing nailed it. Guys, therapy. What the f*** is that? That's a therapist and that's a couple. He's got a clipboard. Done. Why is that?

Those are Whoppers. I'm not picking that f***ing Whopper answer. Called it wrong. My hand throwing Noir Whoppers at his life. Morning Alarm, Clumsy Lover, Surprise Bed Confetti, or Rise and Shine Surprise. Oh, all right, I'm good. I got this one. Let's see. What do you... You thinked confession? Do you think what's a Noir Whopper? Oh, no, wait, I meant to put Manto, not Whoppers, 'cause you said you weren't going to pick the Whopper one. Yeah. Oh, man, I wish more you chose that one. I liked it. Surprise Bed Confetti. But bed confetti is not a thing. This is Drawful, d***. There's no rules. Take, take it. That was good. That was good. Bongo. Clumsy Lover. That's what it was.

It's two little chicks crashing into each other, right? Oh, I see it now. I don't see that. I, I see something a lot darker and scarier. How do you spell Goatsy? Yeah, it's definitely Goatsy.

Manchester United, Bladder of Wine, Blood of Christ, Let's Get Drinks, or Wine Spelled Incorrectly. Whoever wrote that is probably cool. How do you... Do you guys take the, the like award?
