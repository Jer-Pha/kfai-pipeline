Well, that's what I was going to say because when when whenever I'm I I do speak about Batman, right? Um, not and I'm never seriously ever campaigning for it. I mean, we're talking about maybe one tweet I might have jokingly wink wink put my hand up and said I'd love to have a try. People always point me in Batman Beyond because Batman Beyond is is played by it is not Bruce Wayne, Terry McGinnis. You'd have way more leeway with people are always suggesting that",

But but me as a fan of Batman, even as much as, gez, if Geoff Johns called me tomorrow, I was like, you serious? You want to come in and test? You want to do this? I mean, obviously I'd jump at the opportunity. But my problem would be the one Indian person in Gotham, the billionaire. You can you can see his mouth in the mask in the cowl and be like, you're Bruce Wayne, because you're the only Indian. We you'd have to cut your beard too, unfortunately. I would. My Batman would have to be his. My would have to just Batman Beyond. We got to go. We're rebooting Batman Beyond here. We got to uh, now Michael Keaton is going to be your Bruce Wayne. Oh, if we did Beyond, be amazing, right? God, he passes the torch. Yeah, he's in a new movie by the way. I just saw a previous",

But he's in a movie where he plays like a guy that train like a trainer of Assassins and it looks awesome. I can't name of it, but dude, he's having this resurgence. The best thing, a hole in my heart and I couldn't put my finger on it until Birdman. Yeah, and I was like, my Beetlejuice, my my my my Bruce Wayne is back. He's such an incredible actor. He's so important. I don't know. I'd love to sit down with him. Like I don't I don't know too much about his his past and his history, but I don't know what what where that like veered off for him, right? Because he was a huge star closing out the 80s. The that Batman movie made him big. He had Mr. Mom before that, like Gung Ho and all these movies that were great, great comedic actor, did some great dramatic films too.",

Um, and then just nothing for like all the 90s. And I don't know if it was because he just didn't want to do Batman anymore or if there was some troubles that he had in his or if he just wanted to concentrate on family. I know one thing about him, his name is Michael Douglas. Yeah, isn't that wild? And then he couldn't get his SAG. He needed to change his name and then he saw Diane Keaton in the newspaper and went Michael Keaton. What? Yeah, yeah, he was his name, his real name is Michael Douglas and he had the unfortunate like he was coming up when Michael Douglas was huge because of like movies like Wall Street, things like that. Isn't that weird? That is really weird. Cool. That's cool. So is it cool being famous? I don't I'm not. Yeah, you are. What's Comic-Con like for you?",

Yeah, you are. What's Comic-Con like for you now? Cause I met you the one Comic-Con when nobody knew you. They did. Yeah, and they laughed at the pit whenever we had to tell the synopsis of our show and they were like, it was it was a tough one that one. It was amazing. It was incredible to be a part of that. Like just even to be at a panel now is it's all right. It's it's not The Walking Dead. We don't get like I don't cause a a crushing in a in a Comic-Con. It doesn't become a a public safety if I if I'm seen somewhere. It's not that in the slightest. It's a handful of people want selfies. We this was the first year that like every year I like to um the night before. It's like Rocky when he turns up at the ring. Don't know why, but the night before he fights Apollo, but I like to walk the floor, just buy some stuff and say hi to people. Well, we usually are there",

There was a lot more people and I was like, oh, handle them would have been cool, but still not necessary. Yeah, the everyone's so sweet and it's not it's not a big deal at all. It's it's it's it's awesome. And every single person who who who recognizes me either it be from the Internet or from iZombie, it's just it's it's awesome to know that the work's been seen. I love it. I honestly, I will take every photo. I will wait. We we do that all the time. Like I we were waiting for a bus. Everyone had to stay indoors with bodyguards. I couldn't be bothered with that. I went out into the crowd and just signed until but um, you're that Rose. Yeah, I just stood",

Yeah, were you saying I I had a buddy of mine that stayed in a hotel once and I forget which one it was, but apparently it was where a lot of the like A-list celebrities were staying, directors and producers were staying. And I guess there was so much security that but that it was like that he was like, you get through this rush of security and then it's this quiet Lobby where a bunch of just celebrities are sitting on like checking Twitter. Yeah, and no one's everyone's just waiting for their ride to come. Apparently, I wouldn't know what hotel that was, cause you said A-list, so that's where that's where they put. We're at we're at a hotel around the corner. We really are. We really are. But uh, yeah, I mean, it's it again, like I said, it's uh, I mean, I saw I I saw a clip uh,",

There was a video of him outside set and we shoot in the same city pretty much always a few roads apart, you know? And on his set, they had about 50 people waiting for him to come out of his trailer to catch a glimpse, to do some photos. We have we had one every four months. That's the difference. That's the same network and that's usually Yasmin who's waiting. She has a blanket now in Vancouver. Creep. So that's just to put things into perspective even on our own network. Like I never get never never lose. Don't ever lose sight of it just because of five, six people watch your show and say hi at like, you're not famous. You haven't done anything yet.
