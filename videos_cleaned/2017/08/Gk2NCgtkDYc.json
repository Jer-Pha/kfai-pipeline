Nick, before we went live, yeah, you said it's time, which is how they introduced the UFC fight. That's Bruce Buffer, it's classic. This is what's happening right now, right? And I gotta let you know to get into the shit jiggity jam toast. It's totally what about the spread? Just nasty jam, nasty jam. I don't know, I've got to be real, that is the lamest line of shit that I've ever known. It's taking the problem is Bruce Buffer is brothers with I think it's Michael Buffer. No, no, does all the boxing announcement. He's logos, Let's Get Ready to Rumble. It's just perfect. Which if your big brother did that, you're like, what are you gonna do? I mean, don't do, find others, either don't do it or come up with something better than it's time. That's his thing, man. But I'll play as him, but you might like about Bruce Buffer's tone.

Sometimes, I swear to God, I have no empirical proof of this, but I'm pretty sure he changes costumes like midway through the fights. Like, I love sometimes he has this beautiful crushed blue velvet over like dinner jacket lined with like matching pants. And then sometimes, because I, it's like a pattern, like a floral pattern. I like this. My God, yeah, he's that, he's the bad Bruce Buffer. Bruce Buffer. Michael Buffer's boring. Let's Get Ready to Rumble. He's 180. He's the guy that he's, do you think of when you think of announcers? Yeah, there's got the gray hair, is slightly skinny.

And then like, in the fighting out of a buddy out of Sacramento, California, Nate Diaz. And his shit better. And he'll do like a 180 spin, right? And it's the biggest joke. Like, Jill really makes fun of all the time. He's like, we gotta get him like playing games about fantasy. And Xavier91 says, when did Tim become such a buzzkill? I don't know, probably now, two months, six months ago, two years ago, two years ago. I don't know, somewhere. He needs to be so full of life. Let me stop this business. Just like this.

Yeah, thinking that cast just has such great and amazing chemistry together. And then I was like, should I finish The Tick? Yeah, why not? I saw the trailer for it and I was like, this looks better than I thought it would. You know, it is. It's somehow managed to do the one thing that I did not think it was going to do.

Then in the mid-90s, I think around '94, it was a cartoon that ran for, I think, three seasons. Check, correct me if I'm wrong. I think there was three seasons of it, during which it was that it was, I mean, I don't know if reverence is the right word, but it was definitely a, hey, this, we're just making fun of comic books. It was the original OG. Like, this is Harry on this. Like, you know, you had Deflator Mouse instead of Batman. You know, you had the check, you had American Maid.

Like, anybody was always super positive. Something I wonder how they're going to actually take that character, 'cause that's the most important part, right? Is this like unbelievably positive, moronically ignorant, like, dear, and have him be a part of the show? And the guy, Peter Serafinowicz, like, I think he does a really good job at it. But they tried to bring the TV before with Patrick Warburton as The Tick, the guy who played Puddy on Seinfeld. Hmm, and it just did not do. I think it only ran for like half a season, maybe at most, and just failed. Is this an adult thing? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You can get it on podcast services with writing your earbuds. Can't imagine me like, 'Can he be?' I don't like, he's not even human. He's watching at home now. Is it as himself? I'm sure you know he's watching it. Okay, I see that he's always just like Andy. You saw his listening. He's Nathan, who wants to come back. I appreciate that, Nick.

I know they should be. They're gonna be doing a four-hour stream of Everybody's Golf. Everybody's on the PlayStation 4. They're all obsessed with it. People walking around the putts and the greens and the duckies and the birdies. Bogeys is one of the things. No duckies, devil. I think I would know. Who knows? They, Andy is actually a golf expert.

And so here's the thing. This morning, I logged on to the Facebook group, the Kinda Funny Facebook group. And and I saw a thread that Edgar Siyco says, is Kinda Funny organizing anything to help out Houston? It was a whole bunch of people talking. And that got me thinking. I was like, oh man, my first gut reaction, I was like, oh, we're shit. Because that's a great idea. And our schedules are just, yeah, we're all gone for a while.

But then I looked at Greg and I'm like, hey, we're already streaming all day today. Why don't we just turn this into a fundraiser? That's for the big, beautiful kids and everybody out there that's gonna do, see the FEMA, some real, real issues right now. So what we're gonna do is every tip that we get today, we're gonna donate to the Red Cross to help out the hurricane in Houston. You know, and all of you, every dollar that you guys tip us today, we're gonna be actually putting toward that disaster relief fund, which is, I think, currently board and do.

Yeah, but I think it's at least, it's just a step forward. Yeah, we're doing. So I'm pretty happy about that. The next bit of housekeeping. Right now, the new AMAs are live on YouTube.com/KindaFunny and /KindaFunnyGames. One with Greg, I'm sorry, one with Nick, and one with Kevin. Jon Snow just walked in. Here's a question, Jon Snow. Yeah, because it's an Everybody's Golf deal for the stream of 1:00 PM. In this shirt, Andy's worried that it's too tight, 'cause you can see his nipples. Yes, I can. It's not a problem.

Tilda Swinton didn't give up the role in Doctor Strange. So not that they should allow anyone should ever be forced to give up more as much see how heartless the kind of actor but I think this is a pretty big **** deal.

I can understand that but at the same time it's like at a certain point it is a comic book and you are doing a new interpretation of that so I don't think you have to a hundred percent be faithful towards no absolutely not. But I you know I think it's that more egregious. I think it was a little bit more egregious in other words in Ghost in the Shell where the main character is in Japan and it's supposed to be Japanese and has a Japanese name and it's a little whitest person you've ever seen in your life.
