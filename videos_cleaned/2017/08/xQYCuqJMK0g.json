So here's the deal: the trucks are super fucking fast. We're going to die a lot. A trial-and-error game. What we're going to do is pass the controller off every time. Do hand it off that we've. I'm doing it. Honestly, it doesn't. I know, just a rock. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clustertruck. Excellent. Have something we, we're about to do something great. Not a thing. Go. Not sure about that. So here's, here's the deal, guys. We're going to play. The, the controls are you move with the control stick, right? You jump with A, okay? And you run with the, or you sprint with the right trigger, okay? And eventually there's abilities on the bumpers, but I've never done that. Oh my God, what is it? Oh, you're old. Oh my ear. Yeah, holy shit, Clustertruck. Yeah, you keep mis-tracking this time, you pieces of shit. Ha ha ha. I have some. Go. I'm going to be. Then you can have the others go so far.",
