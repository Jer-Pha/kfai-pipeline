Let Tim host, how are you, sir? I'm fantastic, really, fellow. Yeah, man, The Game was last night. Yeah, I still haven't seen Death Note. I've seen parts of it, okay, twenty minutes of it. I have got to look forward to tonight, Bachelor Monday. Time to be Tim Gettys. It is a good time. Any games you're into right now? Games I'm into, there's a lot of ways I'm into. It's not on the report. I'm going to jump ahead real quick. I'm adding another one to the report. This is five, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Yeah, 85 on Metacritic. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's, does that feel like a Metacritic thing that, no, I'm sorry, does that feel, would that be a news story? You feel we've, I've never, oh, I don't know how to handle reviews in conversational podcasts. I appreciate you bringing this to the table. I feel like when there's games that are kind of what's gonna happen",

Yeah, as on the Gamescast with Ryan McCaffrey, available now audio and YouTube for free on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. I called, I thought 80, it was gonna be the medium endpoint. Oh, and that we'd have some 75s and we'd have some 85s, and that's exactly what this is looking good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I just wanted to say, and we'll talk more about this on Gamescast, shut, uh, this weekend when I, when we went to Vegas, had a lot of plane flights and a lot of just downtime in the hotel, and I am addicted to this game.

I'm really, really, really good. Admittedly, I'm hitting a point in the game where I'm like, this is getting a little samey, and that doesn't seem to be challenged anymore. Sure. I feel like I've kind of found a team that is dominant, that takes the fun out of it. A lot of critiques of it, but at the end of the day, I think that it's a major success, and I think that this is a huge win for the Nintendo Switch, right? That a third party can make a game. The fact that this is a Ubisoft game, I think, is very impressive. Doesn't feel like Ubisoft, and I think that this is taking them in a new direction that I would love more of this. Damn. Well, when I find in time, there was definitely a kid who wrote in today. I thought I made it to the dots, a sheep. Oh, no, here it is. Meow Rody.

The Mario + Rabbids reviews are up. IGN gave it a 7.7, GameSpot gave it a 9, Time Magazine gave it a 100, Polygon gave it an 8, Destructoid gave it a 7.7. Those definitely are some numbers, but the general consensus numbers, I love it that he says that, is that Mario + Rabbids is an impressive game that nearly, and nearly Nintendo quality, made by a third-party studio. How do you think Nintendo will respond to this? Will this be a one-off game, or do you think they'll be more open to lending out their properties to other studios? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Nintendo games aren't coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One anytime soon, but here's hoping for more partnerships. Thanks for all you do, and tell Cool Greg that he's so goddamn",

Thanks for all you do, and tell Cool Greg that he's so goddamn cool.' Hell yeah. He signs it, Al. So, still no idea if it's a girl or guy. Nintendo has a history of lending its first-party properties out to, enough Rose Park properties, its, its properties, yeah, out to other devs and other publishers to kind of do their own thing. We saw especially a lot during the GameCube era and a little bit in the Wii. Some of them worked out better than others. Obviously, what seemed into working on there, um, we had Sega working on F-Zero GX. We had Capcom working on Zelda: Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons were some of people's favorite Zeldas, much time. So, this is a lot of, it's all over the place, whether it's quality or not, but I think that more often than not, they've been good or if not great. Namco did Star Fox, they did Smash Assault, and yeah, and then later I did Smash Bros.",

This is like, we're gonna take this and just kind of make a new game. Sure. At it. Well, I mean, that's what's interesting about it is taking the, you know, familiar IP, the familiar characters, and putting them to something different. And I do like the idea that I think this is an interesting way to, I got something, take all my notes there, trying not to do another example is, you know, Warriors games, Hyrule Warriors, Fire Emblem Warriors. What I think is interesting about this is that it's a great workaround to Nintendo's problem of how do you get a Ubisoft or an EA or a big third-party developer to make a game on a smaller platform, on a smaller install base? Well, you partner with them and give them the keys to",

But with, with the guarantee asterisk, yeah, that you're gonna sell millions of copies. Sure. Yeah, you know, like I know like you do with anyone. Yeah, that, that's the thing is, it's like, I'm, I'm very excited to see how well this game sells. I think it's gonna sell very well. Place first. Hmm, maybe not. I guess there was Mario Kart, but Mario is in the title of a Nintendo Switch game that is now in millions of people's homes. The only thing that'll be interesting about it is that this kind of gameplay, wow, if you've played XCOM like I have, you enjoy and you're familiar with it. I feel is still foreign to so many people. Even I was reading the NeoGAF thread today where they had all the reviews laid out, and so many people",

Um, I think the, the XCOM comparison is apt, obviously, but what I think is even more appropriate is Fire Emblem. No, it's not the exact same thing, but at the end of the day, it is a grid-based strategy game. Sure. And for better or worse, and my biggest criticisms of this game are that I wish that it was a bit more clear where I'm hitting. The 3D kind of makes it complication, as the camera is not that great. So, you time, I times where you think you're about that, it looks like that's a guarantee shot, and as I hit go, it sends 0%. I'm like, 'Are you for?' Or even then, like it's hard to see where the 0% or whatever, because I'm trying to see, 'Can I hit that guy?' And it, there's no camera",

Um, but I think that Nintendo fans in the last couple years to have been just, there's been an avalanche of Fire Emblem games. So, I think that there's already been that kinds of people do understand it, introduction. And granted, not everybody knows Fire Emblem, but Fire Emblem sells very well. Yeah, there is an install base of people that know that. Plus, having the Switch, there's not a Fire Emblem on Switch yet. So, sure, after this being Mario, it's like, there's a lot. I think that because we're the job of, 'Here's a genre that you might not associate with Nintendo 100%,' and then doing a good job of being like, 'We're gonna change that. You eventually, you're gonna associate these games and equality with Nintendo.' Sure. I'm, I'm, I'm thrilled you're behind it now, because",

Rob, I enjoy it, don't get me wrong, but I was playing on the plane too, and I got to the first mid-boss, and remember, and it was like, 'Oh, ****, you like didn't beat the **** out of me.' You know what I mean? Like I was dead, and I was like, '****.' And my first thing was like, 'Let me take a break.' Like it wasn't like I wanted to jump back in and try again.

Yeah, I don't feel like doing it immediately. I like the game, I'm not putting it down. I still don't like the sections around the battles where I'm wandering around. They're, they're growing on me. But yeah, I feel like this game, it has a weird curve where it's like, that's subscribe me. The battles are growing on me because in the beginning it's way too easy, and then eventually it becomes more challenging. Am I alright? Cool. This is, it went from being super simple to, 'Oh, there's a lot going on,' and that's cool. Didn't hit the point where once you understand all that stuff, you go back to being like, 'Alright.'

I'm gonna play more of it, but I'm not, it's going to be like one like, 'Oh, I want a plane, let's check in and see what's happening here.' I don't see me beginning its hooks in me where I have to play new stuff. IGN's review sounds right to me. Yeah, 7.7. Yeah, yeah.

Number one, their Thema is a new PlayStation VR bundle. According to the PlayStation Blog, across the U.S. and Canada, we're launching a new bundle that includes the PlayStation VR headset and PlayStation Camera for 399 dollars. If you're in Canada, it's 499. This essentially gives you the PlayStation Camera at no extra charge. It will be the core PSVR bundle moving forward. What's more, the existing PlayStation VR Worlds bundle (PSVR headset, PS Camera, two PlayStation Move motion controllers, and PlayStation VR Worlds) will be available at a new lower price of 449 U.S. and then 579 Canada.

My realtor day, we're at the, the GameStop Expo, and we got to sit down with Mr. PlayStation, and that's right, Shawn Layden. And we got to talk about a whole bunch of things, the PlayStation's kind of line up over the next couple months. Sure. And one of the things that we got to talk about was PSVR, and you asked, 'What is the future? Are you guys?' I said, 'Is it dead?' Oh, yeah. So, coming to PlayStation VR, and I thought his answer was amazing. Like it was very clear, like, 'We're not only are we not dead, here's how we're not dead.' And I think that's the key, because it would have been very easy, but no, 'We're still committed to the PlayStation Vita.' No, he didn't do that. He was just like, 'Here's'",

No, he didn't do that. He was just like, 'Here's what we're doing.' He talked about a whole bunch of games coming to it. Yeah. And what I thought was most interesting was how he defined Triple-A PlayStation VR game, because that's fine. PlayStation VR Triple-A as Farpoint. Yeah, as games. It's not like he's like, 'There's a difference between Triple-A in terms of development, in terms of resources for putting into something, and in terms of brand recognition.' Right? He's like, 'There's gonna be the things like the Batman and the Star Wars and Final Fantasy and all that.' And I asked him point-blank, 'Are there more Triple-A announcements like that coming down the line?' He said, 'Yes.' Yeah. So, there's that. But he's like, 'But what we see Triple-A VR, and what's really gonna push this into being a bigger deal and seeing if it does have a second generation, what",

And I thought that was great. And you know, Shuhei said that classic thing about, 'This thing is the PlayStation 1, we're learning to walk,' and all the different things. And that was what was so great about Shawn Layden driving that point home on upstream publicly with no prep. Right? And the fact of, 'No, we're still part of this. This is the same thing, but we are learning.' And that's what he kept saying. Right? He like, 'We are learning how to do this. This is a brand new way to play games, so we're all in this together,' kind of thing. Yeah.

Secondly, the length of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy makes it a tight experience. This is not overstay its welcome. Uncharted 4, for example, was way too long in the tooth. Thirdly, Chloe and Nadine had a relationship that was unique. Over the course of the game, I found myself worrying whether either them was in, were in danger.
