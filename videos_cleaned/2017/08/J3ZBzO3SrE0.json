I'm gonna read it pretty much in full. There's a little bit after the fact, but I mean, he does a great job of summarizing the entire situation, getting quotes here for Microsoft. And then I'm going to jump over to Ryan McCaffrey, who sets the stage in an amazing op-ed you were read on what he would do right now to save Microsoft, or not save it, but if he was in charge anyway.

Crackdown 3 was originally announced at E3 2014 and was at one point targeting a release in the second half of 2016. It's clearly a complex project, one that has evolved since its unveiling, and Crackdown fans have learned to be patient waiting for it to come out. Crackdown 3 is an incredibly ambitious project that pushes the technological envelope with immersive true 4K gameplay, cloud computing, competitive multiplayer, and a sprawling and futuristic open-world.

One aspect of Crackdown 3 that's getting some attention, that's getting some attention during the extra development time, is the game's visual presentation, which received some criticism after its showing at E3 2017 in June. What we showed is vector coding. What we showed at E3 was a preview of the game and is a great indicator of the level of mayhem and vertical platforming action you can expect from Crackdown 3. Loftus said, among other things, we, we are taking the extra time to focus on the visual polish so gamers can feel completely immersed in the living world.

Here's our one of our big first-party exclusives. What? And I weigh in date exactly the console. Yeah, is it very interesting? I mean, I look at this and I feel the idea of exclusives being necessary in the holiday season is antiquated. Yeah. And as we've seen the last couple years, Sony's really killed it in the beginning of the year, coming out with a whole bunch of games, Horizon, Nioh, Nier, all that stuff. And they did great. And I feel like Crackdown could actually end up doing better in Spring 2018 than its earnest fall. So what they're saying is they have the right time and all that. I buy.

When you look back at Xbox One, Battlefield. Yeah, exactly. Looking back at Xbox One, right, as they try to make up ground on PS4, you look at the system, you're like, well, what happened? The standout exclusives? What all, what has motivated me or anyone to buy the system and have the system over it? And usually it's the third party, because my friends play on it.

These days in gaming, it's very easy for perception to become reality. All it takes is one social media Reddit post to go viral and a label can get attached that's nearly impossible to peel off without leaving behind sticky residue. But in the case of Xbox's perceived first-party problem, there's some truth to it. Scalebound canceled, Fable Legends canceled, Lionhead shuttered, Press Play closed down. I am done. Granted, cancellations are a normal part of the games business, but when they're that public and that high profile, it reinforces the negative perception.

And for all of 2017, there will be just two big budget first-party exclusives, the Forza Motorsport, joining February's Halo Wars 2. That's 2017 for this machine, for a system that's been out for three years. And that's the thing. If you want to, you talked about in the beginning, right? You have PlayStation, right?

I was showing the Xbox One, or whatever the, helped, you know what I mean? Yeah, no, I know. Next Xbox. Yeah, proper system. And yes, it could be backwards compatible and all that.

You look at this generation and they're like, we lost, we've lost this generation. We're not going to catch up to PlayStation. We need to be thinking about the next thing. And so I think at 2016 E3, they announced Project Scorpio. And then what is going to be? And they have a cool trailer. We're all like, oh man, that might be awesome.

They are making money off of this. Yeah, they're doing very well. And they don't need to do better than PlayStation or even nearly good as PlayStation 4 to be worth doing. Sure.

I would say the first way is what you're talking about in what he's, \"I want PSX.\" Hey, we're doing the show, all eyes are on us. Not E3, because E3 is, \"Hey, everyone's doing a show, everything's getting buried, every doesn't matter how big it is,\" right?

No, E3. No, the Kitchen. Well, you talked about the demo that, oh, I'm thinking of, you don't I take it back. I'm talking about P.T. I was talking my P.T. So I thought our house that was Gamescom.
