It it caught out of the corner of my eye as you guys were playing in the I forget what whose booth that was. It was the Indie maker IND yeah, uh and it's it's a cool little game, man. It's got a great art style. Uh it's it's very oddly reminiscent of Wall-E, so you're not really sure what happened.

Tim and Greg don't need to play Emily. We'll get to that second. AP out I would say that is the Kinda Funny Games game of the show. Game of the show AP Devolver because man Devolver Digital it's coming at PC and PS4. Yeah, and it it's essentially like Hotline Miami look top down and you are a gorilla that escaped from the zoo.

It's a lot of um just big bold colors like single flat colors and the the soundtrack it's like a rolling like Freestyle jazz song and everything you do makes drum drum noises. So yeah, you're the giant ape you smash through the glass every to begin the level and then you go through and yeah, you go through and you kill as many guys as you can you come up to Giant steel doors you can rip down and then use the shield and throw it to smoosh dudes.

If you haven't seen Emily is Away, it's okay. It's a game where you essentially it took place between like 2003 and 2006 um and you're on messenger having a conversation and like kind of you get to make choices and stuff but no matter how you played it it ended in the same place. We did a let's play you should watch it youtube.com/ kind of funny games. If you watch it and you enjoy it go buy the game. Yes, that's what I always say because we love that game we played it all the way through the dev I'm going to check for you I want to I know it's is the homie it's one of those where I know his Twitter handle and like that's not his name yeah so that game looks great Emily's way looks even better uh like 2006",
