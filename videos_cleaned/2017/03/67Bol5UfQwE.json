You know, GameOver Greggy himself, Greg Miller, big fan of his show on Instagram, Cooking with Greggy. You can find him on the little hashtags and stuff. He's a big fan of cooking and stuff. Blue Apron been really helpful with that because here's the deal: they send you little recipe sheets, all the things that you need. You can make each meal within 40 minutes or less. Tell me that's not a good deal, Kevin. It's a great deal. It is, it is. So here's the deal: they are the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the entire country. It is their goal to make incredible home cooking accessible to everybody, and that includes me, and I can't cook. I haven't used it yet personally, but that's just because I'm just really not into cooking and stuff. But Greg, Greg's been loving it. Kev, have you used this? No, I haven't, but Paula really wants to get it. Oh, we got",

You could tell her she can check out this week's menu and get her first free, first three meals for free with free shipping by going to blueapron.com/Gamecast. No S there, just Gamecast. Okay.

First three meals free, free shipping. We'll get Paula's review soon and we'll let you know. Till next time, Blue Apron, a better way to cook. Next topic, what have we been playing recently? Let's get some impressions going. Fuck me. Let's start, let's start off with Mass Effect. Okay. All right, you talked a bit about it last week. Sure. Yeah, I did. It was my review in",

Yeah, I did. It was my review in progress and I was you, I'm to play. Then you played all the, not all the mornings. That's the thing. It's like we came back and it was going to be, uh, you know, Mass Effect Mornings here and I was going to play it all week long, right? Yeah, alliteration, good. Exactly. Think that's what I'm all about. And, uh, the fucking PS4 straight up died like day, like it just was like, we were playing it and we showed all these bugs and then it just went, I was like, oh, fuck. And eventually we got it back up and running and I did the Monday playthrough of it. But it was that thing of, well, this is a story driven game, but when you're streaming, you're not really paying attention to the story. This isn't working for me. And then during the down period, people were like, you should play Zelda. I was like, you want me to",

I was like, you want me to play Zelda? So we've done Zelda every week morning since then. But the problem is, of course, when you put Mass Effect next to Zelda, you're like, wow, one of these is a master class in game design and I can't get it out of my head. And so like, I'm going home and playing more Zelda and not playing more Mass Effect. And this jumps into what we were talking about a second ago and the fact that what the way I have been justifying in my head of the trade-off, right? Because I, I, I played a lot of Mass Effect, uh, going into the Gamescast last week, played more of it, then went to Edmonton for the heel kick stuff. And I was like, I'm going to take Zelda with me, obviously. And I thought about buying the PS4. I'm like, I'm going to bring Zelda with me because Zelda is my playing game. Mass Effect's my home game.",

I'm like, I'm going to bring Zelda with me because Zelda is my playing game. Mass Effect's my home game. And now as I've been playing so much Zelda, then trying to figure out what I want to do, I think I have to at this point admit that Mass Effect's fine is what I said last week, right? Like Mass Effect's fine. Uh, I enjoy the characters and everything else, but I think my time might be better served playing Persona. And so I think I need to switch it over to Persona's the home game and this a road game. So does that mean you're giving up on Mass Effect? Like, do you think you'll ever come back to? That's, that's the question of, I, no, I don't think I will. You know what I mean? Cause that's the thing of, I like the Ryder characters enough and I like discovering the Andromeda Galaxy enough. But like playing it that one morning where I was like, oh, here are all these bugs and that's really annoying and this",

I was so happy to have called it in terms of when last week's on the, you know, I'm like, it's going to be really interesting to see what happens with the reviews. I think it's going to get hobbled, but be not get hobbled like six and fives. It's going to be, it's an okay game. It's a good game. It's whatever. And that's exactly where this Metacritic is settled, right? And the problem is in the climate we're in, that's not good enough for sure. That is not good enough for me. I, I can't right now with Zelda on in in my hand, with uh, Persona in my hand, with all this other stuff going on, I can't sit here and be like, yeah, you know what? I started Mass Effect and I need to see it through. Like it's not amazing.",

Like I'm not, I like, I like the Ryder and I like their story and I don't know what I'm going to do with it. I'm in, I'm enjoying it, but I'm not, I, the whatever I, whatever I said in the old Gamescast, three or four or five hours of Persona put in are way better than now probably the 11 hours of Mass Effect I put in. So why not go down? And you could get away with that in a different Q1 and you could get away with that about five years ago when there weren't so many good games coming out. But it's just like, I feel like this is really horrible timing for Mass Effect where like this needed to be a very good Mass Effect game and it ended up being a, it ended up being a Mass Effect game.

Of the review structure and that, or you do think of what's the Metacritic and what are we giving it and what does a seven mean? And when you get away from that and really see what an audience thinks of a game versus what critics think of a game and now to be influencers, but look more importantly, look out when I'm looking at like, uh, you know, Shinobi on Twitter or I'm looking at Britney Brombacker on Twitter and they're enjoying it and they've and like Aaron Porter, our Guardian from uh, RTX took the week off for it and he's enjoying it.

I've played enough Zelda. I'm too tired for this. I could jump in and see the Mass Effect story, but I'd rather watch a movie. And that's not me. I'm not the movie guy. Like that's the thing. So Andy Cortez, one of the biggest Mass Effect fans that I know, like we've been talking, he was just like, yeah, man, like I'm a wait, I'm playing Zelda. Like I, I want to play Zelda. I don't want to stop playing Zelda. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Like this is supposed to be your game. And it's like, that's not good when you know there's something that is, it's been this long. How long has it been since Mass Effect 3? Like that was 0 years. I'm always bad at this.

That's got makes no sense to me. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, it's crazy. Like Mass Effect fans have been waiting for. What's interesting about this is, and this is a sincere look at me, but this is always the weird thing and I don't know if you feel this, right? Cause your job's a bit different with the documentaries. But a weird look at me and what I want out of games and stuff, right? Is the fact that Mass Effect's underwhelming me. I, I, but I like it fine, but not enough to commit to it. And I want to jump to the next thing so I have something to say to the audience about it.

Yeah, I don't know. But it is that thing. And I think the, the problem with that is, uh, is that the more people put it off, the more they're hearing that it's mediocre. And so that the, the tale is dropping. And it is that one weird thing of, and I know that this, and I said last, you know that I'm investing these characters. I am. I like Peebee a lot. I want to see her story. I want to do their loyalty. See, I guess I will get back to it. Is Peebee the really ugly blue looking thing? Uh, yeah, an Asari. She's not ugly blue.

No, that's you. She's, she was in all the trailers, right? Not big Kev dog. Can you, can you Google Mass Effect Andromeda image search plus and then pull it up on on on the wall? Yeah, I guess it's just that thing. It's, it's when we, when Mass Effect Morning is derailed, cause that was that my excuse to play video games this week, which sounds weird with our job, right? My excuse to play was I want to put time into Mass Effect and I wanted, but let's make content out of, let's a reason to do it. And then doing it and not working the way I want it and playing more Zelda. I was like, well, Zelda's so much better now. Go down. You, you're right. That thing, that's thing, that's her, that's her.

That's not what she looks like on PlayStation. Click, click some of the other pictures that are all damn same thing. Now go to the other one to the right. Horrible moves. This one moves. Put Peebee, P. E. E. B. E. E. Mass Effect in Google image search. Why you had it all right here? You're not, you're not going to play it because you're a fucking xenophobic or something.

That looks like that's, is that Sean Spicer mixed with Peebee? It's somebody like that. Yeah. No. Is Peebee Christine Lakin? What? Well, Kev, way. So we'll never know. Sorry. There's a lot going on with Peebee. There, there's a lot. The only reason I, I'm hating on on on your girl Peebee is, uh, I have to make thumbnails for this show.

Is named after fucking food or ways of cooking like shitty cars. No one. Jesus Christ. Yeah, that, that. And and then it's just the fact that Zelda is too amazing. Mhm. Too good to put down. There's also like some sort of remnants of what happened with Mass Effect 3 happening here as well, right? Where you had a lot of people who were playing that game, myself included. I actually never completed Mass Effect 3. I love that entire series and I kept hearing about how the ending was disappointing.

Like you're saying, never did. But you always know what that means. Like when I was like, oh, you know what? I'm not going to platinum Metal Gear Solid 5 during the extra live stream. I'll come back for it. Yeah, never. Right? And what happened was, I think people came in with this expect, with this like just worry in the back of their heads that maybe this game, there was always an element of that with Andromeda where like they might fumble this like they fumbled the ending of Mass Effect 3. And I think it confirmed it with some people. And they're just see what's interesting about it is the fact that I don't know how much it was they're going to fumble it like Mass Effect 3.

And so to get there and have so many weird, but like when we started the stream, right, Kevin, those two guys were just like walking in place. And you're like, this is like one of EA's premier franchises. So for them to get a game out that like clearly took a lot of time and not have it be a home run is so weird. Or to even do that thing, just rush it out before the end of Q1 finishes to get the quarterly in. Like that's, if that's what they did with this, then that, that's really irresponsible. Not, yeah, it's not a good look. Do you think that it's going to do well specifically on the box? Because while PS4 has had all these amazing exclusives, there hasn't been like all the games that we talked about except for Resident Evil 7, right? Um, aren't available on",

I, I think this again speaks, I don't, it was a weird roll out, right? Of the EA Access thing is always so weird. And this time it definitely blew up in their face of 100. Here's a million gifts of faces being fucked up and every like, but I still don't think people canceled pre-orders. I still don't think people, and don't get me wrong, clearly. But I'm not saying like where you're like, oh, fuck, we fucked. I think enough people bought this and then are like, I want to play this. I love Mass Effect. I mean, it's the similar to me of like Infamous Second Son, right? Like I'm this huge Infamous fan. And so Infamous Second Son comes out and yep, I'm going to buy it. And like you",

And I'm sure that's how a lot of people feel. It's more Mass Effect. Yeah, it's rough around the edges. Yeah, it's doing this. But and this is the other thing too, similar to how we're talking about Uncharted 1, Uncharted 2, is the fact that like Mass Effect 1 had its problems too. Oh, elevators and all sorts of garbage that and like just weird stiff animations. And then Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 2 was phenomenal. And that's where it really became this giant thing where it was everyone has these Mass Effect N7 shirts and tights. But they can't make it on Andromeda 2. Like that, that's you don't think so?

I feel like already coming out, Mass Effect had a little bit of dirt on it coming out of three. And now it's, now it's starting to have a lot of dirt on it. And I don't know, like it's fine for people like us who we're not, we don't care about that necessarily. But in the court of public opinion, I feel like having a toxic name is really dangerous for a game specifically. That's a good point. I don't know. I mean, yeah, it breaks my heart.

I'm sure you guys got from from Sony. Yeah, like a good two weeks probably before it came out. I think I played it like almost non-stop for like three weeks. But when I finished that game, I was sad. Yeah. Like I enjoyed my time in that world so much that, but and that's how I feel about Zelda right now. It's like, I don't want, I'm just, I'm enjoying every single moment of.

Is Killzone great? Yeah, yeah. Killzone 3 is great. I like Shadow Fall and I like three was that had that weightiness to and that was, that was fine. I liked it. Shadow Fall, I thought was where they got the like stickiness of the guns, right? And I think that comes across in the combat of Horizon because Jesus has a lot going on in the combat of that game, but it works. Like the slow-mo with the like with the shots, like being able to tumble that it away. The camera operates. The melee stuff works. Like all of it is so tight.

And I hate doing that because I do think they're different games. But a great one of the reasons I love Horizon so much is that I felt empowered when I was fighting and it didn't feel clunky and I didn't feel like I was fucked up.

Like, what do you want me to do? But it's a and I think that coupled with the fact there is so much to do means that when you hit those roadblocks, it's fine. It's like, I'm going to go do something else. By pure like osmosis in this world, I'm going to find that information to then get me into",

I was just like, she has this, she's like, it was a screenshot from her phone of just like, my phone is filled with things like this. And it was just a conversation bubble of like, if you do this, you can find that person. But whatever. And I think all of that is super key because uh when it comes to Zelda, comparing the the specifically Zelda 1, Link to the Past, and then Breath of the Wild here, I think that Zelda 1, classic game, no one will ever, you know, fight that at all. However, I do think that part of the magic of that game was the conversations people had in real life. And it was like, oh, how do I do this? And someone else just figured out, oh, if you put a bomb here, there's a secret. But like, the game didn't tell you that. And I think that's f*** like I",

It's like, and but it's like that pixel looks no different than any other pixel. So Link to the Past having the cracks, I think is a is a way to like, all right, cool. This at least is teaching you a language of what you're supposed to know. I think the Breath of the Wild is kind of the perfect evolution of both of those where it has the openness of the first Zelda, but it's all logical. So, oh, it's too cold. I'm shivering. Right? I need to get hot. How can I get hot? Oh, if I wore warmer clothes, you know, or like uh it's it's all type things like that where like, oh man, I need to figure out how to shock something.

I think you need to have that bomb placed on a random wall just once or you need to think that that's possible. Cuz if you think that that's possible, then anything's possible. And Zelda's World feels like a world in which I'm un I'm learning so much about what's going on here, but it still feels like there's so much to learn. And Derek also told, you know, there's that old thing about why Zelda was made. Miyamoto was walking around that forest and he came across a cave, right? And he's like, wow, like I discovered this cave. The story ends there. He doesn't talk about what was in the cave. It's not B having sex condoms condoms as far as condom just like rows of them. It's it's it's about the mystery. It's",

They don't. They're telling you about the trick. And now what what's cool about Zelda is that that element of mystery. It's an untangled thing. We're not talking about figuring all this stuff out. We're excited because we don't know everything. And for people, I also feel who are in their 30s, who've been playing video games for a while, sorry, you're younger than us. This similar thing, right? That's rare. Yeah. And I think that's why Zelda's really, I mean, today playing on the stream, right? Kevin and I got to the uh Shrine with the constellation.

And then like I pitched this idea, it doesn't work. Kevin pitched. Kevin finally is like, what if we did? I'm like, oh f***, of course. And then I still didn't have my head completely wrapped around it. I was like, this is great. Yo, Zelda's got Portal in it. It's got Portal in it. The Shrines are Portal. Oh no, I yeah, and that's my favorite part. Oh man, the Shrines. I I f*** I just love it so much. I now that I'm done with the game, criticism I have is like, all right, did it need more Dungeons? And I I do think that it I personally think that it could have used two more Dungeons and less Shrines if that had to be the concession. Shrines are there. There's 100.

I've loved so many of the Shrines. There was a handful of duds, but overall, I'll give it to them cuz even the duds tried something different, right? And there's the Minor Test of Strength and Major Test of Strength or whatever. And like there there's a couple too many skipping all those Major Tests of Strength like, nope. But but at the same time, I do feel like there is a reward. Those tend to be the Shrines that were harder to get to. So it's like getting to the Shrine was the challenge. The shr I've walked in where I like busted my ass to get there and like, all right, cool, here it is. I love that. So good. So I like that.

Here they are in the beginning of the game. Master these things because you can be f*** creative and do whatever you want. Every puzzle is going to use these things. The amount of times I'm in I'm in one of these Shrines and I'm just like, I must not have nope, that's not the answer. You have everything that you're supposed to right now to beat this. Figure it out. Yep. It's great. And so many games don't do that. They keep their like Master stroke to the end. It reminded me of Half-Life 2 where it's like, no, here's the gravity gun.
