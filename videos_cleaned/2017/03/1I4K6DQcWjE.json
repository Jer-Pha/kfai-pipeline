It goes like this: Nick, everybody, and this is a pack of lunch. Everybody, everybody has that thing, you know, the one thing that can tick them off and get them very annoyed and irritated quickly. The thing that you fundamentally dislike on principle alone. I'm a fairly relaxed person and I don't really get annoyed by many things since, but for me it's when a person asks another person to communicate for them to me because they can't do it. Example, this is in quotes, Greg wanted me to tell you that he feels uncomfortable when we go see R-rated movies. I find that on principle rude and kind of messed up. If I'm friends with someone, I want them to come to me whenever there's some, whenever there's something up and we'll make it work and hash out any problems that and not involve more people.

So in short, what pisses you off, everyone at the table? There was not an E.T. cartoon from the last topic. That sounds like fake facts from Kevin. When I think about things that truly make me angry, there's only really one word that comes to mind. Don't say it, Kevin. That word is Kevin. Yeah, we all knew it was coming. God bless. Yeah, Kevin just has the ability. Joey's just done. Joey, like, \"Fuck this show, fuck everything with these people.\" Um, God, man, I don't have things that like make me rage that much these days, but the things that do piss me off, like there's one thing that's been pissing me off a lot lately. Here we go. Uber drivers.

That's every time an Uber driver does anything when I'm in the car with them. Like they just suddenly don't know how to stop the car. They're just like, I'm like, \"Oh, right here.\" And they're like, \"Um, s-I'm sorry, sir. I don't remember which one of these fuckin' things makes me, uh, where's the wheel?\" No, I hear you. That's my thing with Uber drivers where I'm always like, I'll always give them a reference point. I'm like, \"When at the old houses, right by this no parking sign.\" And they go, \"Right here!\" And they jerk the wheel over and stop. I'm like, \"Sure, there's clearly no sign here, but you're stupid, so whatever.\" Also, driving the city around that many Ubers is annoying.",

That's what happens here at the office. Like, \"Fuck, dude!\" Like, at le-like there's 30 other places you could have pulled over there. Just pull in a little bit. There's literally in front of the Kinda Funny Studios here, there is a Muni stop in the middle of the street. So there's like two lanes of traffic there going one direction and inevitably the guys start getting hesitant. I'm like, \"After this light, you can pull over in those spots.\" And nine times out of 10, they slam on the brakes right there, stop traffic behind them. People are laying on the horns. I gotta get out of there real quick. I'm like, \"Hard, it's all bad.\" Yeah, yeah. Tim, what pisses you off? I there's a",

But, but again, really like just thinking about like the things that just like, just, just deep, deep down just upset me, sure. Um, I I would just say like to deal with family shit. Like there's just so like I I guess it's when people do dumb shit, like really dumb shit, and I'm just like, I need, I'm required to be responsible to take care of this or to be a part of this or what I don't want to fuckin' do this. I really, and that is what upsets me is just people being dumb, not being courteous to to others, not really thinking.

Like I was, I've been bitching about this for the last three weeks, but one of my neighbors just has a dog. No, oh, did he get the dog? Did that happen? I heard neighbor. Oh, sorry. My so we have one neighbor who just has been dog sitting for the last two months. And I'm like, \"Two months is not, that's not dog sitting. You have a dog now.\" And they're clearly trying to hide it because every time they walk out, they're like, \"Shh, be cool.\" And I'm like, \"Everyone can hear you. I I can fuckin' hear your dog.

Mind you, he got a fuckin' Husky. Those are very supportive. Studio apartment with his girlfriend. So I'm like, \"Well, maybe it's not going to last that long 'cause at some point someone implode.\" Um, so that's just one of those things where I'm like, I it just especially in the city where everyone's living on top of each other, people are so fuckin' selfish these days and they just don't give a shit about anyone else.

Yeah, and it it just sucks. Like it I'm like, \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" The only thing I can do is like meditate or escalate. You get a cougar. You get you need to. No, you my emotional support cougar. Try to get a panther, but they're really hard. Clarify that it's an animal cougar, not just like an older woman. Like, \"Well, when you're my age, they're just called dates.\" They're just women you date. Anyway, um, yeah, so just things like that where I'm like, you know, just you're absolutely right.

And then I'm just shit on. Then they just open my mouth and shit right down it. And it's like, man, it's the worst. Mine's simple. It's I've talked about it before, like the thing that makes me more angry than anything else in the world is technology not working correctly.

I always go back to the, you know, uh, the first person who was ever on the show as a Patreon guest that paid for it was Luis Machuca. And when Machuca came on, he came over and he was all excited to be there. And this is when we we've been out of IGN a week and a half maybe. And we had just done a bunch of Let's Plays or we're trying to do a bunch of Let's Plays. And for some reason the fuckin' shitty ass Avid or a a capture cards we have weren't working. There was no Kevin. So that was me. And he's trying to be like, \"Hey.\" And I'm like, I'm fuckin' raging and I'm trying not to talk to him and take it out, but I'm screaming at everyone in the room except him.

Yeah, you don't do. It's never that easy. Never. I the thing that like drives me nuts is we're in a group of people, like usually it's at my apartment and we have people over, whatever.

So my favorite thing to do is to not acknowledge it and to just see how long they the next sigh, what they're going to do. Like, \"This is just rough.\" Or, \"I can't believe this is happening.\" No, if you want to talk about it, if you want to vent, you want to process, I'm here for you. What you got? Do a master. This is what you got to do. You you take your phone out, you're like, \"Yep, that sucks.\" And then you don't have to have the screen on. Just kind of just like you're scrolling through something. I I would say I'm good at that. You do that a lot really well. I mean, like I like granted it's me, so I talk a lot.

I've been trying really hard in the last year and a half, I would say, to like not get ratcheted up because I go from zero to 60 when it comes to things that just I'm like, \"This should be solved by now. We have talked about this so many times.\" And I'm just so upset. And it's funny because like love and sex stuff, the joke is it's about communication. Life is communication.

And it's just like, I what upsets me is when people do not take a step back and be like, \"What's the best way to communicate how I'm feeling right now to to others?\" And it gets hard between especially like thinking about us in this, sure, in this bu-like you hate technology, which then means you don't communicate well to us, which means we now we're all upset.

I fuckin' love gossip, but it's like there's a level of I love it in a way that's not, um, destructive. You know, I kind of just like talking about things and I just like knowing what's going on.
