Then they have now that all their their new stuff's coming out with the the mobile games, they're trying to like actually create an ecosystem. That's why they add this thing, but you can have nicknames. So you had your nick Nintendo nickname, but that those are things you can just change anytime. Okay. Change the name anytime, buddy.

It reminds me more of we talked how I wanted the more Zelda style experience from an open world game. And I started getting that. I'm just like man like the fact that I could play this game so differently than than you guys played it and still have such a great time is a testament to its quality. And I haven't beat it yet. That's why I wasn't on the review. Um but I'm I want to say I'm probably over halfway at this point and I'm just going to keep going through and then Zelda comes. So that's going to be a whole thing. But like I'm having such a great time. I'm definitely going to beat this game and it's it's it's going to be up there for me for game of the year. Oh yeah. I think I mean granted we're in February but I think you can easily see I mean like I think we're going to have some stellar games this year and I think there's going to be stiff competition by the",

It's so special. Yeah. And so yeah to the topic we're jumping into here is like if you've been following me on social media or anything like that uh I've fallen in love with photo mode in this game. And photo mode not new to video games but not something I've ever really **** around with. I mean I've seen it you know in the uh Naughty Dog games and like \"Oh, that's cool.\" And I think you know in Uncharted 4 I took a few snaps of like Elena and some perspectives that I thought were cool and I was like \"All right, cool.\" Well yeah shut up.

And I don't know if it's uh the you know meeting here the intersection of my own you know like not not love of photography. It's not like I have a great camera or something like that but I like Instagram and I like making social media and framing things for specific things and trying to tell a visual story. and the fact that the game has so much going on in that the photo mode's so easy and so great that when we jumped in uh when I went down to LA and played that preview event like in the preview I talk about the fact that I I was playing the game on the back of you know just one of the striders going through a thing and I stopped it you know went through put this white border",

Here, I'm putting up like 30 some. I think I hit 50 hours last night. Uh I'm I quote unquote have platinum it. Uh there's one corrupted area I need to clear and once that's done, the platinum is mine. But since I've played on so many systems, I don't want and the trophies aren't live yet, I don't want to do it and pop the last trophy and then hope that when I sync everything, the game's smart enough to be like \"Oh, you you earned a platinum.\" I'm leaving one",

I mean, we've been sitting on this one here of this black and white Aloy. This is in the middle of a battle. I hit pause, jumped into photo mode, was able to swing around, put a depth of field on it, so she's in focus. Nothing else is in terms of it. What I think is cool is you've been posting them on on Instagram. Like, I don't know what your schedule is, but I've seen a whole bunch of them, right? Oh yeah.

And so that's me and those are my personal biases and that's the kind of thing where I just don't care about jarhead talk and why I don't see most military movies that are like into **** like that. And so I understand needing to relate on some level to a character. I just don't think I've ever had it so boiled down so base level where I'm like, \"Oh, it's a chick. Don't care about her experience. Clearly there's nothing I can relate to her.\" Right. Like that's not the point. That's not the disconnect for me. Yeah. No, that's interesting.

Uh there there's a lot of similarities to movies, the difference being movies are something that you just experience. Uh video games are something that you interact with. So, you are Aloy because you are controlling her agency and what she's doing at that time. Literally, the choice of what she's saying. Uh but when it comes to movies, it's like I I think about how I relate to the characters and it's kind of what you're saying. It's never like I relate with this character 100% and I'm all in on this.

But I can't look at any other movie and be like, \"Oh man, I I pretty much fully relate with this character and their struggles and this is my story.\" Yeah. So, when you take that to video games, I'm like it's it is more about do you relate to the situations they're in? Do you relate to the decisions that they have to make and um the the obstacles that they have to face? And uh with with Aloy in specific, it's like, \"All right, Aloy Nathan Drake, their sex doesn't matter to me.\" And again, that is being said as somebody that has grown up playing as a white dude in video games forever.

And I think that's a an interesting way to to look at it because I relate to this Sing Street character in a way that I don't think I mean you guys wouldn't.

Would like to play it, but don't know that I'll dust off the PS3 to do so.\" Yeah, I'd be somewhat shocked if it wasn't available on PS4 before Neokuni came out because it's it's uh first of all, porting these games isn't a huge challenge. I think there's more games to be sold here in that respect, but also it it sets the stage for the game was bigger than than Namco Band I thought it was going to be I'm sure. But I mean it definitely was but uh but you need context probably for why the sequel matters. So um what's all Drippy up to? Who's this guy? So I feel like uh I feel like it's I don't want to say like I mean who knows? I'd be surprised though if if it wasn't made available. Um it's similar. I hope they don't do a similar situation what UB did with South Park: The Stick of Truth where it was like kind of locked behind pre-orders for the next game. Like it would be a nice idea for them to you",

Like it would be a nice idea for them to you know a few months before Nouni comes out. Be like the Nouni one available on PS4 for 0 bucks and and you'd probably sell a bunch of copies and it's basically free money. So it is on PlayStation now. So there you go. Yeah. Whatever. There you go. There you go. You don't need to buy new games when you have PlayStation now. Ladies and gentlemen this has been kinda funny games guys. Thank you very much for joining us. Until next week I love you.",
