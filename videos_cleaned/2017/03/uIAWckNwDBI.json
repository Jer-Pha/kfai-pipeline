One of my very favorite people in the industry. We've only met I think twice in person until now. So this will be our third time. But uh we have we've we've long corresponded on the social media etc. The tweets tweets the direct messages. And I've been long been a big fan of what you do. So I appreciate you coming in to talk to us. I am a big fan of kind of funny. You guys have this this setup is incredible. I love it. This studio is so cool. Thank you. So I wanted to take advantage. You obviously work out of New York City which is where I wish I worked out of. And uh you were here for GDC so I had to take advantage of this opportunity that you're in San Francisco. Get together. Um you are of course the I was looking at your news editor at Kataku but I'm surprised you're not running that whole thing at this point. I I wouldn't no Stephen Sel",

I I wouldn't no Stephen Sel. Stephen is the best possible manager. He's the best boss I've ever had. He's the best possible editor-in chief of Kotaku. Like trust me he he does so much **** behind the scenes that like Oh am I allowed to curse him? Yeah. Yes. Oh my god he he does so much behind the scenes that keeps this place running. It's incredible. He's the most talented person I know. Well shout out to you Mr. Tootill. We'll have you on the show hopefully one day as well. Uh I wanted to have you on. So I want to explain this to to the audience real quick about what this is. For the audience that's been with us since before we were even kind of funny when when it was just basically Greg Miller's YouTube channel back in 01 or 013 whatever it was the very first show we ever did was called A Conversation",

I wanted to call this A Conversation With Colin Was Right because I wanted to tie in the old show with the new show. Um Colin Was Right is doing really well and you people out there seem to like it. What do you mean by you people? You people. And uh I specifically want this interview series to be about something a kernel of of truth or untruth or whatever it might be within one of the episodes. This is going to be all untruth. Yeah. All it's all **** up. The reason I wanted to have you on is specifically because you inspired episode 6 which was GameStop's slow demise in the all digital future.

Um and there really only are a few functioning working journalists really in the gaming industry in my in my mind that I'm seeing do real digging and real investigative stuff and really breaking stories and not just regurgitating the same **** that the PR people tell you. And so that's why we respect you so much and our audience respects you so much. Um and so I want to talk a little bit about that about the state of journalism. Let's talk about it. Let's do it.

So they you know as I said before they must have lost a ton of money on that but but they let me do it. And uh when I left IGN um I was sad to see that uh not not not to build myself up I guess but it's like it's like a pie chart where there's only a hand Matt Leone for instance or or you know like we said Patrick Austin Walker guys that are like really doing some digging.

Like it's fun to be like the first news organization and the first reporter to break the news that uh No Man's Sky was delayed or whatever. But uh that sort of thing is kind of you're going to find it out anyway. The work that I prefer to do is stuff that you would not find out if not for the work that I am doing and giving you.

Destiny is in there. Star Wars 1313 is in there. Uh a whole bunch of stories. You can see them all. They're actually all on the cover.

As someone who does it are you as dismayed as I am?

And yes it goes into the economics and not everyone's as blessed as we are kind of funny to have to be largely fanfunded through Patreon. So I understand that we can kind of skirt that issue a little bit. We're not really worried about how many views our videos do because it doesn't matter right? Um but uh are you as dismayed as I am?

That's an interesting Well I think the main reason for that just speaking as someone who reads has to read the news every day and handle like cultivate what appears on our website or part of what appears on our website um is that nobody has time to sit down and watch a 0-minute video and it's much easier to scan an article for news than it is to watch a video.

But usually I just don't have time to watch entire YouTube videos which is just I don't know just the nature of the work. I I definitely think that uh something we talk about often is that how much news we must be missing in that world but it's just a a resource problem of bandwidth problem. Yeah absolutely. And I can relate to that because even when I was even when I would do interviews uh at IGN like when I did the history not like I had 30 hours of interviews and I'm like I'm not transcribing this like I know you send it out to someone to do it and so I I I think",

Um at an editorial organization like Kotaku, we run advertisements and I'm sure they're game advertisements uh all the time on our site, but those are all handled by the business people and editorial is just a separate entity entirely as opposed to on YouTube where the editorial people, the people making the videos are also the people reading the ads, which is something you guys, I'm sure, have to deal with all the time.

I think I off-handedly mentioned it on a podcast and people brought it up the other day because I was like oh Shadow of War. Um, but it's not something that I was going to do a Kotaku story on because if you saw a headline that was like the next Shadow of Mordor game is called Shadow of War, it's like who cares?

Um I think the original so at first in the beginning of 2013, the first story I was really investigating that year was Aliens Colonial Marines and trying to figure out what happened there. And so I wound up reporting that story about how Time Gate, this studio, uh I think they're in Canada or we're in Canada.

And this was 2013, so it was well before or it was just after they had rebooted what would become this version of Doom, the one that was turned out to be great inexplicably after all that.

Some companies are better than others, as you guys know quite well. Um, but yeah, it's nice in some ways. The worst part, I think, is just not being able to get them to comment on anything. Like I think that there are news stories where they we everyone would benefit more if Bethesda commented on them in some way. Um whether it's some game being broken or like cheaters in a game or whatever else. Um I think it's to their detriment that they're not commenting to Kotaku on things like that.

So yeah, so they're not giving review copies to anyone anymore ever. Is that their they're no more. I mean they started that with Doom and then they did that with Doom 2.

It's just they want that information out there because it's it's necessary for people to know and for people to know that people are looking for jobs. And um with other stuff, with stuff that's more like Krytek, uh I don't know if you remember when Krytek was not paying anymore, which is still happening, by the way.

More often, it's someone who I'm keeping anonymous, but I know who they are. Right. Exactly. That's that's my situation. That's a different answer. So uh I also think that there comes a point where like as a journalist you have to cultivate all this trust and trust can be broken very easily.

And immediately all the big Destiny YouTubers were like, \"What is this nonsense?\" Like someone was like, \"Uh my uncle's friend told me that Destiny 2 is getting delayed.\" And there's a lot of skepticism.

Recently, I I wrote something about Destiny that I don't want to get into because it was wrong and or Bungie said it was wrong and they came out and denied it.

NES second you know N64 third GameCube fourth Wii U fifth. So like if you remove that Wii anomaly which was an anomaly with a poor attach rate poor software sales.

Um I wish that the Switch Well so the hardware itself is it feels very much like uh the first iteration of what will be improved upon because it's it's it's got so many small problems that are just really annoying. The kickstand is really bad and there are all sorts of weird configuration issues and like there's a left Joy-Con thing. Yeah.

Um, that said, with Call of Duty, I there haven't been any real disasters. I mean, some people hated Infinite Warfare because they didn't like the setting or whatever. They and the multiplayer Jon Snow was terrible. Um, but uh that doesn't mean that Call of Duty is in a bad place necessarily. And I think that all they have to do is come out and be like, \"Hey, here's another World War II game.
