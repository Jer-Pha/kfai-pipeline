            "text": "Greetings and salutations and welcome back to Colin Was Right as you may remember last week's episode was dedicated to Xbox One and a tumultuous but still successful Road the console has traveled since 2013. I figured that this week I'd give the PlayStation 4 similar treatment chronicling its performance and perhaps most importantly its unique library of games because while we get into a few important reasons why PS4 has done so well its stable of exclusives represents its trump card. Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are healthy relative to historical sales data but the PlayStation Brand's future looks markedly brighter at least partially because of its renewed emphasis on exclusivity. Make no mistake about it PlayStation 4 is performing fantastically from a commercial standpoint. In 39 months on the market PS4 has sold around 55 million units which is a significant sum. It's impressive that in just north of 3 years the PS4 has outsold GameCube by 33 million units the original Xbox by 31",

It's impressive that in just north of 3 years the PS4 has outsold GameCube by 33 million units the original Xbox by 31 million units and Genesis by 5 million units all consoles on the market longer than PS4 some by a gap of several years. What's more impressive is that it's now a few million consoles ahead of Super Nintendo only 8 million or so behind the original NES and within Striking Distance of entering the top five bestselling consoles of all time. That's no joke by the way that's really esteemed company to be in. We're talking about PS2, PS1, Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360. PS4 will never surpass PS2 and it's unlikely to even reach Wii and PS1 numbers but the fact that PS4 will rub shoulders with any of those five consoles is staggering. Remember console gaming was left for absolute dead 5 years ago many developers foolishly abandoned core markets for social and phone gaming Publishers invested big money in those",

PS4 was supposed to be a modest success at best instead it's proven many prognosticators wrong. You know how the Wii U failed to take off that was basically the expectation for all consoles moving forward. It's also important to remember that the PS3 and Xbox 360 era lasted forever likely doing no insignificant part to the financial crisis and the reverberating shock waves it sent through the larger economy companies weren't investing people weren't spending and the generation was artificially extended. The SNES was on the market for 5 years when N64 came to store shelves PS1 lasted a similar amount of time PS2 6 years how about PS3 7 years Xbox 360 8 years these consoles had time to burn there was pent up energy for something new sure but the thing",

This level of unexpected commercial dominance has been sustained for multiple reasons for starters PS4's announcement in February of 2013 was nothing short of masterful doubling down on core Gamers who were becoming increasingly disaffected by a wholesale move to mobile and social gaming. They never endorsed was a stroke of Genius. Sony was targeted and on point and its messaging was substantive. PlayStation 4 got off on the right foot and though we've had evidence this was important in the past we got definitive proof because Xbox One stumbled out of the gate and as I argued last week while it's a great console in its own right it's never recovered from the Don Mattrick era and it never will. Microsoft needs a clean slate Sony is perfectly happy",

I truly believe that if Xbox One was conceived of and pitched better PS4 wouldn't have had the start it did. I mean who could forget that PS4 sold a million units in its first day on the market only in the United States it was clear from the get-go that console gaming was alive and well and that PS4 would end up leading the charge for the duration of the generation PlayStation 4 is most",

This is the kind of stuff that gives consoles positive word of mouth with the most prominent purchasers and players of games which in turn resonates outward towards more casual inconsistent audiences. It's how a winning Coalition is built just like in politics hook the True Believers first and expand outward from there you can always count on your base But ultimately you can only win with a wider positive reaction now I'm not going to sit here and make the case that most PS4s were sold with exclusives",

I don't believe that hell the Wii U had no shortage of Defenders around the time it launched claiming that a console could sell on first-party exclusives alone clearly that's not the case the Wii U is Nintendo's biggest mainstream Bomb by a mile but that's important because of Nintendo the Undisputed Kings of the first party ecosystem couldn't sell a console based solely on their exclusives PlayStation sure as hell isn't going to what PS4 does have however is just about everything else and when you add it all together the sum total of these parts is compelling.
