The episode of GameOverGreggy Show with Christine Lakin, who comes in and you're like, \"And here's a guest that me and Nick had no idea who she was.\" It would have been perfect if it would have been on top.

You of all people, yeah, I would have expected if that phone had got into the urinal that you would have just looked down and been like, \"Time to get a new phone.\" And that's where I want to jump off with this topic is the fact that, yes, but the iPhone 7 is now waterproof. That is a good point. Yeah, they're water resistant or whatever. Uh, you guys travel with me all the time. You know that I'm obsessive.

I know I'm about to eat. I've washed my hands and then someone tries to stop me and I got to either do like, I'm like, \"Well, that's,\" I'm like, \"I got to eat.\" And you know how I am. Like, I'm not like OCD about it, but I know it'll get my head and I'll get sick. See, that's one of my favorite pound. Yeah, the elbow is the new pound. I'm down with that.

But you do that sometimes with people. It's like, \"Oh, you know, I don't like what.\" It's like, they don't know that that's thing. But I notice it the most when we're, whenever we're doing signings with the Vita and you're just like, \"You know, just use the um, clear nail polish if you want.\" If you sign a Vita, use clear nail polish on the back, which make, if when you explain it, if you sign a Vita, put clear nail polish and it won't go away.

Shout out to the first, I've signed three Switches now in the world. They're out there. See? Okay, now we got to get the rules straight. Yep. 'Cause it's like Beyond! where we used to scream Beyond! only when Beyond! was said in context. So if we're talking about a Switch, that's not it. It's like when, \"Oh, I see you're saying.\" But if I'm saying, \"I switch cheats,\" then we would snap. Then you switch. If you're talking about the Nintendo Switch, then you don't snap. Everybody on the same page. When people say like, \"I went above and Beyond!,\" then you say Beyond!. But it's like, \"Oh, I was watching Beyond!,\" then you don't. Exactly. Colin.

I was like, I was like, \"Oh, I'm, I might have, you know, sparked a little creative juice.\" That's possible. So to the point, yeah, I am very obsessive about the clean cleanliness and all that jazz. And I think on a normal day, things would have gone differently. But I've done the Dice Awards. I've been drinking all night. Now I am drunk. Yeah, I am at in a Vegas casino at like 3:30 in the morning. Jen and I have ordered Wings over at the, the place where at or whatever.

So at a urinal, there's always been a discussion, is it okay to be on your phone at a urinal? How do you feel about that? Where do you come down on that? Where do you come down on that? I've just accepted the fact that my phone and me are disgusting. Okay, so I'm just like, \"Yeah, whatever.\" Cisco, would you use a phone at the urinal? Uh, absolutely. All right, cool. And Nick? Yeah, sure, why not? Of course. And so, but you need a case, man. Look how thin my case is. Yeah, that's nice. But does it even protect them? It does. See, but look how good.

The problem is when you go with the phone this big, and this is the only problem with going with the phone this big, you don't get a nice grip on it, especially with the iPhone design. It's the matte and stuff aren't, yeah, aren't like nice from rough surfaces. And it's terrible. It's terrible. It's too, it's too slick. Yeah, exactly.

And I don't, you know, these are, excuse me, I got to get that out. It's waterproof. It's okay. But it, no, it does that thing where it hits and it goes in the urinal and I immediately reach and grab it right out. And there was that moment of like, \"Man, I'm proud of myself for doing that,\" 'cause it was instinct. It wasn't, there wasn't a thought of like, \"What do I do here?\" And then I finish my business and go over there. Soap and water my hands, soap and water the phone. I'm like, \"We're already wet.

Don't do anything. It's not till the end of the meal where I'm done, done that I take it out and do anything on it. Is it still working? Is it not?

God damn you, Survivor.\" And so then it was like, I go downstairs and I'm like, \"Do you have the alcohol wipes in this, in this casino?\" And they're like, \"No, we don't.\" But they had hand sanitizer.

We'll see. Um, and also, you can, uh, get me on social media on my Instagram. It's just CiscoSqo, um, or OfficialCisco. But basically, whichever, if you look up CiscoSqo, whichever picture is not from the 90s, that's me. Until next time, S.P., our pleasure to serve you. Thanks for watching. You can subscribe here.
