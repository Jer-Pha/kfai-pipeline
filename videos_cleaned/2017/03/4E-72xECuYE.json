She was like, oh yeah, it's really funny. I was like, man, you should give him a ND like, see if I can go, you know, read for or whatever. And she gets me a read um, and so I go to read for uh Brian the Dog um, and apparently, you know, uh Seth uh Seth MacFarlane, the creator, um, apparently he didn't like any of the uh auditions for Brian.

Uh, next thing you know, everybody's like, all all these everybody's trying to form a group and get under a lamppost and sing. Do how do you know? And and so we were, you know, some 14-year-olds that tried to do the same thing. I mean, it was attack of the, you know, boy bands and groups and everybody try to be a group and everybody was trying to be a boy. And so did you guys start performing like like things?

Then one of the members of my group, whom I didn't know could sing, um, actually invited me to be in a group that they had right around when we had just gotten into like high school. And um, and so, you know, we started singing with that group and, you know, we formed a group and then we performed at a talent show. And that's when we met our manager, Kevin Peck. And he had a it was a talent show at um Morgan State College. And he had a group and his group um uh actually won the talent competition. Son of. And we were like uh second place or something.

Yeah, like a legal pad. Right? And they basically wrote our contract up on that. Wow. And at the time, um all of the other guys was about to turn 18. And I uh I had already turned 18. Um, so I was the only one that could really sign it without consent. So you signed it with a capital Q in SisQo? No, the rest was history. I had I had to learn that that that came later. We used to practice our signatures though. So that's that's the thing. Practice a signature. It'll it'll prep you for being, you know, a superstar. Um, and uh and so basically we signed that.

It wouldn't even matter, 'cause we would we had just graduated. So it was like, we didn't have to go. I mean, 'cause remember uh when we first got signed, it was when we first started high school. When we got signed again, we all sign. I had to eat humble pie.

And then we had to find a name. Um, so at the time that we got signed, our name was Legacy. But it was another band called Legacy. And also they thought it sounded too much like Jodeci. And they thought that we sounded similar to Jodeci. So that didn't really work. And they was like, \"What's that park that everybody drives around um in the summertime?\" We was like, \"Drew Hill.\" They was like, \"That's your name.\" I was like, \"No, I didn't want it to be Drew Hill, 'cause I\"",
