I'm a fairly relaxed person and I don't really get annoyed by many things since. But for me, it's when a person asks ask another person to communicate for them to me because they can't do it. Example, this is in quotes, Greg wanted me to tell you that he feels uncomfortable when we go see R-rated movies. I find that on principle rude and kind of messed up. If I'm friends with someone, I want them to come to me whenever there's some, whenever there's something up and we'll make it work and hash out any problems that and not involve more people.
