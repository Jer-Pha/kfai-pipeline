Uh, thank you for joining me today. Thanks for having me. Uh, you know, we we said it beforehand, but I appreciate, you know, it's GDC is very busy. You are the CEO of a an established developer and therefore have other things to do and so I'm sure you know this is probably the least important thing you're doing this week. No, it's awesome. I love uh chatting. I mean, we had some great back and forth on Twitter so get followed up with some hashing out chopping up in person some substantive conversation. So for people that are just tuning in or haven't watched the other episodes of A Conversation With Colin Was Right basically the idea is uh I put these episodes out there I get feedback positive or negative from people in the industry and I'm bringing them on to either take me to task and tell me why I'm wrong or we can reinforce ideas or",
