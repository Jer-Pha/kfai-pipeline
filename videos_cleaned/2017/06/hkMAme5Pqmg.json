Good call, Vector. Number one, Vivendi's plan to get Ubisoft is still happening and it's getting crazier. There's more wrinkles to it. I'm going to read the GameSpot story here about your update on what's going on with this possibly hostile takeover of Vivendi taking over Ubisoft, but it's important to know that it all comes from Reuters. I'm reading the GameSpot story because they gave precious context to it because I'm not a businessman. Some of the stuff they were saying, the Reuters thing, I wasn't picking up weird words.

So the Guillemot have increased their stake and now collectively owned 13.6% of Ubisoft's shares and control to 0. % of its voting rights, according to a filing by France's AMF. However, it will reportedly not seek any additional seats on the board of directors. Five of the of the 10 directors are members of the Guillemot family, including Yves, who we talk about all the time, the board's chairman. Last week, Ubisoft expanded it board, huh? Last year, last year, Ubisoft expanded its board with two new independent directors, bringing independent representation to the 50% mark. This is the point Ubisoft hoped to achieve as a means for helping to stave off Vivendi. Vivendi has steadily increased its control of shares in Ubisoft since 2015. Its ownership ownership is now up to 27% of its shares and 24.5% of voting rights. At 30%, that's the important part.

Ubisoft and Guillemot have repeatedly spoken out against Vivendi's move, saying it would hamper the public P's ability to innovate and be agile, among other things. Vivendi said in early 2016 that it has no plans for a Ubisoft takeover, but his actions have suggested otherwise. In April, Reuters reported that Vivendi would pursue a takeover attempt this year. Last year, Vivendi took over a French developer, Gameloft, which was also founded and led by the Guillemot. Amidst all this, Ubisoft has continued to focus on live service games, VR, and support for Nintendo Switch, parentheses, most notably making the upcoming Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle.

We've been hearing about it for so long and typically with this type of stuff, it ends with it happening. It's going to happen. Yeah, like I, I don't think that there's any way that they can get away from it. I think that they can just try to delay it as well. That's been the most, like, the heartbreaking thing about this is I think when we talk about the big publishers, right? Obviously, there's the big three who make hardware. We don't even think about them. EA, oh, the most evil company in the world. Activision, I just want to annualize ****. Ubisoft, they want to annualize ****.

Let's make a Rayman game. Let's make Valiant Hearts. Let's make something on the UbiArt engine. Well, also too, I think that Ubisoft has something special going for them in that they, they are a franchise house. It's not just like EA has its sports games and it's kind of just different sport, same game, you know? Whereas with Ubisoft, it, they have this whole range of different IP that they, they can go back to and it's similar to Bethesda in the sense that like, not every year needs to have every franchise. So they can kind of not annualize things, but every other year or every three years or every once in a while and change things up.

True. Here's an open world game, a million things to collect, a million things to do. I'm not against that. I love that. But it also runs to the fact of like, okay, cool, I'll play The Division and be super invested in that. But For Honor, which isn't exactly, you know, not apples apples exactly, but you know what I mean, isn't for me. Yeah, but for that argument, it's the same thing where it's like Madden and an NBA 2K are not the same thing either. So no, I know. I'm just saying just for the argument's sake here of what it is.

They make sure they find an audience with those kind of games. For the most part, they support them. I know people right now as a, and this is me speaking from my very limited scope of what games I care about from Ubisoft. I see other Division fans on The Division Reddit upset that they're not getting more updates, that this isn't happening, what's going on with the game. Um, but I appreciate that Ubisoft doesn't ****. I appreciate that they come out and they're like, with Assassin's Creed, we're going to make an ass. Somebody asked them years ago, hey, are you going to make an Assassin's Creed every year?

And they didn't **** you. They came back a year later with Origins and it's like, it looks better, it looks different. We'll see what, how great it actually turns out to be. Yeah, it's interesting because my gut tells me that when I think of Ubisoft, I think of quality gaming experiences. And I feel like the last couple years that's become less and less true just in the sense that there's been a lot more uh, misses in terms of all the Assassin's Creed bugs and all that.

Uh, but thinking about even what they've done with with the Rayman franchise of bringing back 2D Platformers and like these, the Rayman games they've been putting out, Legends and Origins, those are the best Rayman games that exist. Sure. I mean, Rayman 3 is awesome. That's a 3D platformer. Uh, but the original Rayman platformer, like 2D platformer, it was, it was good and it's solid. But these new ones are up there with Mario games. And I'm saying that as a huge Mario fan. But they did something different with 2D Platformers.

And of course there are misses and of course there are a lot of uh, fully buggy games. But it sounds like the last couple misses they've had in terms of The Division and Rainbow Six Siege coming out and being a little content light, they do over the year grow and add to it. For Honor is a great example of it coming out and like, hey, this is a game that every was super stoked about and then, oh, it seemed like the mainstream walked away from, but the core stayed and they continue to add to that to where now, now it is a game that you see on Twitch all the time.

Yeah, I mean, what scares me about it is I think that Vivendi is, or I'm sorry, that Ubisoft is good to the gamers for the most part. You know what I mean? First off, you play stupid, who the **** cares? I get it, you know what I mean? But they have franchises people want. They have audiences that want us. They want to take care of. They make games for them. They stick around. They somehow walk the line better than most in terms of, yeah, we're a business, yes, we're making art, yeah, there's a, a middle area where we can all be happy. The problem with me in Vivendi is that I feel like Vivendi comes in with a lot of baggage in terms of their history, right? Because I'm, I was looking up to make sure I had it all right.

On September 8th, uh, the company announced that Sierra Entertainment, a division of Vivendi Games Group, would be publishing the new. When you start throwing out that like Vivendi was with Sierra, it's like, oh, all right, these are the people who are populating that THQ space. I always talk about, we're not AAA, we're not, we're not independent. We're these mid-tier weird ass games that don't really make money, but we're trying to make money. Like we're putting these things out there that aren't a quality product, but we're trying to make money off of them.

And then from there, there's the like the Bethesda and like 2K Games of the world, I think, are the uh, outliers more than anything. And so that's the thing. On December 2nd, 2007, Vivendi announced that it would be merging its Vivendi Games unit with Activision in a $8.8 billion deal. This will allow the merged company, Activision Blizzard, to rival Electronic Arts, da, da, da, da, da. And it's so, it's one of those things of, it reminds me a lot in, in terms of my knowledge based about it is very limited. Obviously, my pool is very shallow. But it reminds me of when Ziff Davis bought IGN, right? And we were all like, oh my God, Ziff Davis, these are the guys that ran EGM into the ground and sold off.

But that's the fear, right? That is in, in a world where is that Activision drops this because it can't be FR, it can't be annualized. That's not what I want to hear. Granted, Ubisoft makes annual franchises, but they usually are making good games on those. I mean, the thing that bothers me the most about this is the fact that there's obviously a fight between the Guillemot family and Vivendi. Yeah, obviously there's disagreements and their visions do not align. If their visions aligned, this would be a very different conversation and they, the takeover could be a mutually beneficial thing. And we've seen that before. And we are on a different side of this.

But even with like Rooster Teeth and Fullscreen, I think that I've seen Rooster Teeth go from what it was to what it is now via the help of Fullscreen and having partners that believe in the same vision. And that wasn't an issue at all. Ziff Davis and IGN, I would say, is the same thing to an extent where Ziff Davis came in and made IGN better. I watched a movie last night that was in association with IGN Entertainment. I was like, what the ****? The things IGN are doing now on a giant scale are because Ziff Davis allowed them the resources to grow in the ways that they're, they're growing.

They need to make money at the same time. Yeah, Beyond Good and Evil is a perfect example. Them coming out and crying and stuff. You can tell how much they, they care about the games that the gamers care about. And that's what's important. Never going to see uh, someone come out and cry about Madden, you know, or any, any of those games. And I don't want to single out Madden, but like uh, even any, well, I guess Yarny is a, what it wasn't called Yarny Unraveled, Unraveled. Yeah, Unravel. Yeah.

And I think that's because their library is so vast and varied and they do have a commitment to at least trying different things and committing to visions on a game by- game basis. And I don't think Vivendi is going to have that same outlook. And I think that's obvious with the conflict that is already arising here. 100%. And that's what's scary about it. And that's why it's, you know, I mean, we don't know Vivendi. We don't know the people behind it, blah, blah, blah.

So, well, it's interesting. The next story, number two for you, Vector, on the Roper Report is more Ubisoft. This is Yves himself over on the Ubisoft blog talking about Splinter Cell. Quote, Splinter Cell is a, I'm sorry, this is on AMA, uh, or Reddit. Splinter Cell is a, the brand we talk about a lot. It's also personally one of my favorite series. We don't have anything specific to share at the moment, but teams are working on different things. So stay tuned for more. Then this was followed up with, I think, a response on the blog.
