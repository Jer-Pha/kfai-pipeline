They are not cute. They are appalling actually. I wanted him to take the mushroom and if they were rabbits, I'd be fine with it. Hello everyone and thank you. We've always wondered what could happen if our crazy Rabbids were unlift upon the world of Mario. Did you really wonder that? Today you were alone in that. The dream is reality. And to talk about this unexpected encounter, it is my great honor to welcome a very special gu, someone I truly admire. Please, yeah, yeah, the homie. Oh yeah, always with the weapon this guy.

So over the years, I've always felt the deep heartfelt passion that Ubisoft developers have for Nintendo and its characters. Crashes the stage. That would be awesome. N music hits that come in. But on the other hand, uh, because we're both software developers, we've also looked at each others as kind of rivals and and tried to see who could make the best software. Uh, but of course, I've known the Rabbids characters for many years and I have many Rabbids figures, uh, decorating my desk. Wow. So I've always been a fan of the characters and their humor.

When I met, I had just just one condition for this project sitting next. I said, whatever you do, don't try to make a a jump game or a Mario platformer. Try to make a Mario game that has never been made before. And it's great. And I, I can tell you, it was an exciting, very exciting challenge for all our teams. And I think we have done something you will love. So thank you very much for giving us the chance to to perform on this game. In the chat, Elliot9, we don't care. Show the **** Rabbids.

And so now let's welcome Xavier, you know, the the producer of the game and he will show us the game. So thanks again. Let's go. Thanks again. Thank Trav can get it. All right, stop it with the thick comments. Finally, finally, we can talk about this project for the first time. Nobody's talked about it. So we've been working on this game for more than three years now. And, uh, to be at E3 today on this stage is just, uh, super exciting. So what is this game exactly?

Yeah, all right, here we go. Got a Roomba. They're following the Roomba. So the Rabbids have been teleported into the, uh, the Mushroom Kingdom and it made the world completely unstable and chaotic. So Mario as a true hero wants to save the day, but this time with some new friends. And at first they don't really know each others, but in the end they will form this, uh, dream team that will potentially save the Mushroom Kingdom. There's a lot going on in this gameplay. Running around a lot, you know, exploring, making friendships. Maybe it was all about the friends we made along the way. Exactly. It's not, it's not, it's not about getting the game is a turn-based tactical Adventure game. Uh, combat is a really big part of the concept.

Um, so you will fight wave after wave of Rabbid that somehow turn bad. And, uh, what we see here is just, uh, the very beginning of the game. So it'll be perfect to talk about the combat basics. Uh, so the two flags you see on the screen here is to tell you this is a battlefield zone. So you switch from exploration mode to battle mode. The blue zone is your zone of movement. So you move anywhere you want that Z. You know what I'm saying? You can also use battlefield ingredients such as, uh, covers for protection. So Rabbid Luigi here using half cover or full cover. And, uh, we also have what we call team jump. So by jumping on your teammate, you can expand your zone of movement. So here Rabbid Peach using Mario, she's able to flank the enemy. Get ****. So you can also attack the enemy behind that cover and expose them by destroying that cover. Um, you the WR neighbor really interesting in terms of",

Um, you the WR neighbor really interesting in terms of strategy because for next turns, you'll be open for attacks. And last but not least, techniques. So from defensive ones like, uh, Rabbid Peach's Shield Boost or offensive ones like Mario's Hero Sight, he's able to attack the enemy even if it's not his turn as soon as the enemy moves. So this is a very core aspect of the game itself. So you mix and match attack options, movement abilities, techniques. But we also have, um, other ingredients such as, uh, pipes, Rabbid Pipes. So those give you, uh, a good move to flank the enemy. So here, for example, Rabbid Luigi goes into the pipe, out of the pipe, dash the enemy, goes for Mario team jump, land behind the enemy in one single movement sequence, and then finish off the enemy.

So again, this is just a glimpse into the basics of the game. And as you progress into the game, uh, you have more tactic tools. You'll be able to do more combo setups. You'll be able to use different type of heroes, different type of weapons in order to battle your way through, uh, the kingdom. Boy, damn. Damn. **** combos. If I'm being honest, it looked really dumb walking around, but then the combat just XCOM. Still hate the Rabbids. My prediction was wrong so far. Okay, I predicted people would be pleasantly surprised. Speaking for myself, I was not. And that's just a a glimpse into the game itself.

We poured our energy, our talent, our passion into bringing the land of pyramids, pharaohs, and mummies to life. To bring ancient Egypt to life. I've always been a fan of Egypt character design.

Here is our gang of pirates, The Raiders, going head-to-head with a gang of rival players, The Cutthroats. Victory goes to the team with the most loot at the end of the hunt. Are we ready for a hunt?

And we have had since then a full year of support and continuous development of Steep. Since the very beginning of this project, we have been working with athletes and we have always been impressed by their passion and dedication. We learned how one champion spent 300 days a year on a trampoline to practice for that perfect landing. We learned how others make more than 6 million turns to practice for the 15 they have to race in competition. These athletes, they travel to the world to train with the best, to compete with the strongest, and to challenge themselves with the most experienced and skilled coaches. 8 million half-pipes.
