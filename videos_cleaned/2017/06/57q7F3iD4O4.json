Yeah, it was just like life update stuff, but like he started talking about our breakup. It was this month last year. What about your breakup? Just that it was a mistake. How he handled it.

What do you say back initially? That he was busy later, but he eventually said yes. We agreed to meet at his house later. Why meet at his house? So he felt better. I don't know. When I got there, we went to his room and then he just started crying. Been there, been there. Usually I'm masturbating too, but yeah. Stood your ground or were you crying? There you go.
