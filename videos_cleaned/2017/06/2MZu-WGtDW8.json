Uh I think from the Oscars when he was making fun of uh Matt Damon. He was like, \"Or you can go away to try and make a ponytail movie.\" It floored me. Got it. Got it. Because basically everyone's making a shit ton of money off of Chinese dollars right now. It's the state of the industry. Again, not saying it's good or bad. It's just a trend that's happening. Everyone should be aware. Do you think it's good or bad? Do I think it's good or bad? No, I mean, no. When the when when it works, when you can get a good creative team behind it that actually cares about delivering a story, yeah, dollars are dollars. It doesn't matter where it comes from. And the fact that we can uh infuse a little bit of our culture into the Chinese market, sure, why not? I mean, I think that's cool.

Um and I'm not one to say like I'm I'm not a traditionalist when I walk around AMCs, which are Chinese owned theaters and you see Chinese movies coming out into them. I'm like, my first instinct reaction is like, \"Whoa, this is weird,\" 'cause it's foreign. But then who cares? If it's a good movie, it's a good movie. If it's not a good M, no one will see it in the States and it won't do well and they won't, they'll stop putting them over here. That's what that's what happens. Go watch my movie. Okay. But also everyone has to also remember this, Transformers is not geared toward, you know, 30-year-old men. That's it's a kids movie for all intents and purposes. But you're supposed to bring a kid. You're supposed to have fun. Supposed to be spectacles and shit.

Yeah, they don't give a shit. They don't care. So anyway, do we have any more stories? No, that's it. We do not have any stories. We should read tips. We have to get going. I apologize. I went long in the tooth on that. Nick96 says, \"Hey guys, is it Nike or Nick?\" Do you think? Say, \"My dog Nick, my dog Nick.\" Say, \"Hey guys, have an extremely important question to ask.
