My doctor usually doesn't like me to go outside in the daylight, so you know, I I I made an exception. Thank you very much. Bad hot right now. I am not down. No, this last week has been an issue not even including E3, just in SF. Yeah, and and I live up north where it is usually way hotter, so it's been like real bad up there. 105 damn degrees the other day. Yeah, yeah, it was 105 up there.

Uh, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. A little late on that. Yeah, Jeff doesn't go to the movies a whole lot. That's uh, yeah, that's probably the second movie I've seen this calendar year. Wow. Yeah, you know, Wonder Woman, you could go see that. Um, my wife has already seen it. Transformers last night. I hear it's a real banger. I hear that's a hot one.

I actually I came back from E3 and for whatever reason, I just uh, I got into Titanfall over again. I got back into Titanfall. Single player or multiplayer? Uh, multiplayer. Okay, yeah. Uh, and played a little bit of that. Uh, and then gosh, I have been kind of mixing Injustice with Tekken 7 lately, which is like a hard back and forth to do. Where do you fall on that? A lot of fighting games coming out. Yeah, it's like it's Evo season, right? So everything has to come out now in order to be played at Evo. So I guess that's probably why it happens.

Like the the story mode is kind of bad, but in a way that is classic Tekken. Yeah. Um, now to be clear, you broke my heart because I follow you on the social medias. You know, I like I like to keep up with you. And so you tweeted, hey, Tekken 7 has a really easy platinum trophy. And I was like, we had just gotten the copies in. Went over to PlayStationTrophies.org. It's like 15 hours of this Platinum. I'm like, I ain't got time for that. I thought this was going to be I could just, you know, spam X over and over again. There go. No, there is one trophy you can get by spamming X over and over again. Uh, it's I don't know. It might be a silver. If it's a silver, I'm interested. Uh, good Lord.

Like you need to break the floor with this character, but you can't do it in offline versus, which means you can do it in practice mode. So you just you just load a practice mode and knock out like six trophies right there. Um, I'm telling you, man, like it says 15 hours, but really as long as you can win like one fight online. All right. I don't know, man. My sheer odds, you should be able to make one happen. You're talking to the guy who in Injustice story mode, I haven't done Injustice 2 yet. I will do it soon.

The Joker come with me. Yeah, uh, I think the second one does that too. I'm not sure. I've heard some I've heard great things about the story. It's it's really good. I I'm I don't really like superhero and DC's superheroes especially. So Superman's pretty much the worst character ever conceived is what I'm saying. I like I would just like to say I don't endorse every single thing this man says. We hate this. I I don't like DC, but I don't I don't hate Superman that much. I'm just saying.

The majority in cool people. All right, got. Yeah, yeah. So I mean, going back to a larger discussion that was happening earlier last year with story modes and fighting games, do you think that they are as important as people made it seem when Street Fighter didn't launch with one? Totally. Yeah, I think that uh, Injustice, if you look at, you know, like that game will probably sell quite well. Uh, their games tend to do pretty well. And that game has, you know, number, right? Yeah. So, you know, Street Fighter V when they launched that, they launched it specifically because they had commitments with Esports stuff. They had the Capcom Pro Tour coming up. They had, you know, to consider Evo. It's like that game kind of got launched incomplete because of those commitments.",

And Injustice has so they've always put so many different modes into their games all the way back to Mortal Kombat stuff on the PS2 and all that where they had like a puzzle mode and a cart racer and just like weird stuff, weird weird. But they've they've hit a good stride with that where, you know, like if so Street Fighter V is really only for people who care about it in this deep, you know, way. And there are only so many people that fit that mold, right? Like, you know, I play a lot of fighting games, but even at some point like I was really disappointed with Street Fighter V. Um, whereas Injustice is a lot more well-rounded. Like it's a lot more recommendable because you're just like, you know, if you like fighting games, this is still a pretty good fighting game, but it also",

So I I think that's really hyper important just like from like a business angle. But again, like everyone's going to come to it wanting something different. So the Evo crowd, you know, tournament fighting game players, they don't really care about a story mode, but there's only so many of them. I also feel like Street Fighter of all the franchises, like the story mode is the thing I care about the least in those games compared to, you know, the NetherRealm games, Tekken, et cetera. Like I feel like those games just do a better job of recognizing just how stupid the whole premise is of a story mode in a fighting game and have more fun with it with the Street Fighter stuff. Even like IV and you know, like Ultra IV, which are games that I like, like that when they when they try to build",

Even like IV and you know, like Ultra IV, which are games that I like, like that when they when they try to build that stuff out, I just never really cared and they barely built it out. So it was really just kind of like growing out of the arcade modes that those games used to have. And now they're trying to do this uh, this story mode for Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. And I don't know if you guys played that demo that came out during E3. Did not. Did not. Yo, it's bad. So looks looks bad. Does it play bad as well? Uh, you know, that demo plays poorly. My understanding is that when you're playing against other people, like the full game is actually pretty good. But like the demo they had at E3 was apparently more impressive than what was in that thing. What's in that demo is like you watch a really ugly looking cut scene where characters go, I'm Dante or you know, whatever. And then they fight. Uh, but you're fighting against",

Uh, but you're fighting against these like Ultron like faceless robots. Uh, and then that's then it just shows another cut scene. You play two more characters and there's really not much going on. It's a it's a really ineffective demo for that thing. Are you guys big fans of Marvel vs. Capcom historically? It's always been too much for me. I love to watch it like at Evo. I love watching people find ways to discern the chaos to find like threads of action within just complete nonsense. Like that's super fun. I never want to play it. I love the idea of Ryu throwing a fireball that is as tall as he is and doing it in the air as well. But yeah, just the combo system, the way that stuff comes together, like it's it's beyond me. Yeah, like I loved 1 and 2 and then 3 was a little too much for me. And then uh, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom even",

And so Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, I was like, oh cool, this looks like less chaos, manageable. But then now seeing, yeah, it's kind of one of those games for sure. Where's everybody coming down on the story mode in Arms? Uh, it's it's not so good. Have you mode of the game? The well, both actually. Yeah, I've been loving Arms. Really? I I feel like I'm done. Like I I finished the I did not finish it on four, so I was not able to unlock the ranked mode. But uh, I think that game needs better control options. I think that the going through the Grand Prix and just having it be like an announcer going like, hey, fight. If it was just punch people to be better instead, it's like, now play volleyball.

And then it's like two on two or one-on-one-on-one. And these other modes where I feel like I'm not I'm not getting better at Arms because it's it's not letting me focus. I feel like all the weird modes though are still just the same core mechanics. Like the basketball thing, all that really, you know, and it kind of like guides you in that way. And then the target practice thing or whatever the hell they call that. I just I just don't think it's that fun. Or at least for me, like I I played a bunch during the Testpunch stuff. And I thought, you know, there were ideas in there I liked, but just the core gameplay never has not really struck me. And I'm all for Nintendo like branching out",

And I think I just want the ability to use the right stick to curve my right fist. Like so if you're playing with if you're playing with the motion controls, you can curve separately. If you're not, you can't. That's my biggest problem with the game is the lack of control options of changing them because it's I feel like the presets they have are good, but there's so many little things that I feel like we should be able to remap. Like the block is so stupid because there's so many other ways. In some ways it plays like Smash Bros. Like having the jump button uh be the whatever the hell the triangle button is.

And him, me and Jen just kept playing around with it. And then Shu came over and we were all playing this game. And we one-on-one was the way to go. When you did two on two, it was insanity. But it was like, oh, engaging with someone and trying to do it was great until everyone was just better than me. And then I couldn't do anything. I forget this game.

See you next time on the Kinda Funny Games. No, besides because I feel like with Splatoon, we saw something where a lot of people expected it to just kind of die. And then it didn't.

So that was kind of like that was the hook that sort of kept. There was like, okay, what are they going to do? What are they going to do afterward? And and a lot of what they added was good.

The quote pulled up. I I was is the quote, those squids have eight legs. How many legs does Arms have? A Nintendo Direct video in a small Japanese social media campaign have hinted at a story. It's literally one day people just woke up with extendable spring arms. Nobody knows why. Some of those folks decided to use their Arms to make money fighting. Nintendo is said they'll add more later. So there's the DLC. It's going to be the lore of why people have Arms.

I mean, it reminds me of old Street Fighter games where it's like you get one screen of information with some text. You're like, all right, cool. I guess that's their motivation. But I I enjoy that each character has their own kind of backstory and stuff, but there needs to be more because you only get that in the beginning of Grand Prix. There's like nothing you at the end. And it might as well just be like, yeah, along the way, it's like, go home and be a family man or whatever. Just over and over again. You know, I just I love that premise.
