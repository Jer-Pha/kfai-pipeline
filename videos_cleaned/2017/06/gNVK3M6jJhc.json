So you know, I think I think I could imagine being on that team and trying to make a really good job of that if your back's up against the wall. You have any more predictions, ****? No, do you? I think we'll see Matt and Trey on stage at Ubisoft. You think that's dangerous? What do you mean? Because it's slipped so many times. No, but they have I okay, I know that they've had a hard release date before. They have this new release date is October 17th this fall. I think Ubisoft loves having celebrities on their E3 stage. I think they've kind of realized that hey, we shouldn't waste our money booking a big musical act for Just Dance because the audience at E3 could give two ****. Do you think they",

I think they've kind of realized that hey, we shouldn't waste our money booking a big musical act for Just Dance because the audience at E3 could give two ****. Do you think they realize that? No, they do because last year they didn't. They had like the crazy clown color Jason Derulo there though. No, he was the year before. Um, so last year last year was the brilliant Ubisoft Conference of here's some gameplay, sit down and talk to me about it. All right, here's some more. What are you **** doing? Choose one. Last year horrible, sucked. Yeah, it was weird. Um, I wouldn't say it sucked long. Um, it was too long and it was I mean there I think that there was just too much awkwardness and now they're like doubling down on the awkwardness is like something that they want in their conference. And I think that that's the wrong move. I think they need to get away from that and go back to cool making it cool.

You and Hip-Hop Gamer just no, Sony son son is his thing. I think that um, you know, they need to get their celebrity on stage in another way. And obviously, you know, South Park is huge for them and the community loves South Park. The first game did really well for them and we we're going to see them on stage. Los Angeles, they're already there. Like that's a solid bet. I like is Aisha hosting this year to be know that's what I was looking for. No confirmation. Yeah, is what I've been able to dig up even though or really if I'm being honest, **** **** article from IGN India about it. The **** seven the seven embarrassing occurrences to expect at E3 2017.

Number one is Aisha Tyler at least the first when they List look, we love Aisha Tyler and Archer. When she's being interviewed, she comes across as a goofy, nerdy and pretty chill person. On stage as a host at Ubisoft's E3 pressers, she's arguably the worst thing imaginable. That's disagree entirely. Mr. Caffeine, yeah, exactly. I know there's a million worse **** presenters I can think of like Aisha rolls with the punches, actually knows what she's talking about. Show about it too like that's I just don't want them to build the awkward in like how she sat down with that random audience. Like we don't we don't need any of that. Just like show us the games.

I've maybe got one there just talking about Ubisoft and do we think of all they they are they get dragged into maybe not dragged into they put themselves into interesting forms of like debate around, you know, representation and culture in games, right? Do you think they come out and actually address any of the Far Cry 5 stuff directly any of way not stage? Yeah, maybe on like the IGN stage or the GameSpot stage or like Keighley's stage or whatever, right? Like they might have that actual conversation about it. Um, but there's no way that they're doing it at a press conference. They don't have to. No, why would they? Yeah, all right. Any final statements? Kingdom",
