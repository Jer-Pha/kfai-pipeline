Yeah, we really did. And it was at one point Tim and Greg, we're just walking around and Kevin and I were like, okay, now. And we fed you a PowerBar and yeah, went right back up. I would make like you were just as beautiful elves would naturally crawl open and you split on foot one piece of food in there and we're like, no. Yeah, yeah, it was necessary. We made a **** ton of videos. We made a lot of videos. Yeah, and when I say we, I mean predominantly you, Andy, Greg, and Kevin. Yeah, I did my part. You did your part. I did some stuff. I gotta be re-shot by Burzui when play again. She was happy with it. What I didn't realize was that you, we didn't have direct feed. No, sure didn't. Sure didn't. So went in there anyway.

Nick only booked on three things total, I think, compared to I think I had 30-something things. Yeah, so that's what I did for you for how busy you are. But one of these you're booked on was a Let's Play of a thing called Burzui. Yeah, which is, yeah, we are when you're on a bike. So that, yeah, so what it is anyway, yeah, but it's like, it's another workout game, right? And there's a full suite of games they have.

Yeah, oh my God, I'm just gonna play around. Oh, I hear Kevin's voice coming and he's laughing at me as he's and it gets closer, the laugh just gets louder. Yeah, and and we get there and Kevin's like, hey, could we get direct feed? And the guy who just looked at him like he said a word that I hate, the guy's never heard before. Mm-hmm.

I guess that mic's broken. So that's a fun thing to find out. Well, that's weird, Greg. You've been breaking a lot of mics lately. You've broken two of the podcast mics too. I just want everyone to notice something real quick. What do you want to notice? That I got a new Super Cup. Woo!

So here's the deal. Kinda Funny Games Daily is focused on news and our reaction to the news, whereas Kinda Funny Gamescast is more about what we're playing and big topic of the show stuff. So when topics get brought up on Kinda Funny Games Daily, the idea is we hit on it and then we'll, let's talk about this as topic of the show's attack on Game Time.

It works and it's just, yeah, we paid a bunch of feedback and it's pretty freakin' cool. But yeah, Sony just hasn't approved it and there's a whole set of logistics there, but not in our hands.
