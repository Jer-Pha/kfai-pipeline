Our team's focus is to bring the most complete Battle Royale experience ever to console and deliver a great experience across all Xbox One devices. This stage is so our development is truly community driven, and we owe much of our success to everyone who's given us feedback over the past year. With over 3 million PC players to date, we can't wait to bring Player Unknown's Battlegrounds exclusively to Xbox One later this year with an update for Xbox One X enhancements shipping with the final version.
