      "text": "What's up everybody? Welcome to Kinda Funny Games Daily for Wednesday, June 28th, 2017. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the busiest lady in the industry, Andrea Rene. Greg, can I just start the show by saying I feel vindicated that Days Gone was playable at E3? I'm so furious at Eric Jensen that he did not say, \"Oh, Greg, you're a judge, why don't you play this?\" That's why you didn't get nominated for anything, Eric, you're asleep at the wheel. John Garvin, asleep at the wheel. All of you. Next time, yeah, when you're a judge, yeah, you start the conversation at the booth and say, \"I'm a judge, what do I get to play?\" And they'll be like, \"Come to our private air-conditioned room with snacks and play these games no one else gets to play.\" Okay, maybe you should just, you should, I'll get the, I'll get the robes next time and the gavel, and then you can walk around with like a clipboard, be like, \"Excuse me, this is Greg Miller's judge, please get out of the way.\" Um, no, I'll do that for myself and be like, um,",

I bet you will be next year. Well, the thing is, I've never been an executive editor at an outlet, so it's generally the executive editor or the editor-in-chief who's invited from the outlet to be the judge, and sometimes those people delegate that responsibility to somebody on their team because they're too busy to go and do it themselves. Um, and I've, you know, moved teams so many times that I've never gotten to be a judge. But to judge is weak, though, several times. Fun times, right?

What do you think, Andrea? I think it's no surprise that Super Mario Odyssey dominates this list. It certainly dominated the conversation, uh, the week of E3. Everybody that I spoke to that got hands-on with the game absolutely loved their time with it. It's time for a new 3D Mario, and it has a really nice fresh perspective that we haven't seen. I remember when it was first announced last year, I was skeptical. A lot of us were skeptical. We're like, \"What is this weird new Mario?\" And then after seeing, you know, lengthy gameplay this time around, I'm very excited for this game to come out. Yeah, I can't wait either. It's for me, you know, after we, I nominated my games or whatever, and you get back the ballot, I vote, if Mario was there, I voted for it.

It was the most fun to play. I liked, I liked everything about it. So to see it on here compared to everything that was playable, because remember, stuff that wasn't playable, like Spider-Man, disqualified. You had to have up to, you had to have five minutes at least of hands-on time for judges. Um, yeah, I thought it was great. I was happy to see it. I was surprised to see Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle win Best Strategy Game, 'cause there is that XCOM expansion, and like, this is kind of copying XCOM in like, what, not in a bad way.

Here is a way to try these mechanics and understand them in a way you maybe didn't before. Sure. I don't know if that makes it deserving of that award. I didn't get hands-on with the expansion, yeah, um, for XCOM, so I can't speak to that gameplay. I did play Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle and really enjoyed it and had a great time. I didn't play enough of it to really see how deep the strategy level go. Um, I love the graphics and the characters are so whimsical, and I'm a huge Rabbids fan. So just like the audio design.

It doesn't matter what language you speak, you can understand what they're trying to express because of the way that they've been designed, and to me that speaks volumes about their creation as characters and how they can cross, you know, cultures and languages and how they can kind of, you know, grab onto that inner child and all of us and say, \"It's okay to be wacky and go.\" Sure. What for you, what Rabbids game stands out? Rabbids for me pop around the Wii, right? I remember the original Wii when they started popping up and they were everywhere and there was party games and all this jazz. Well, the one game that I played the most was, um, Rabbids TV Party.

There, it's, it's a nice change of pace to play a game where all you do is kind of giggle and laugh and, and let yourself be a little ridiculous. Sure. I mean, that was my thing is like, coming in, like the key art that got leaked for Mario + Rabbids was like, man, I really do not like the Rabbids still. I don't like them. But then when I watched the trailer and I watched the demo, I was like, all right, you know what I mean? Like the gameplay looks cool, and it's, it is something different for me to play on Switch, which I'm all about. I don't like the whole, let's follow the Roomba around and walk around the world map.

Yeah, the exploration elements of that game are something that I hope they show more of in the near future, because what they showed at E3 didn't really feel like exploration. It felt like, okay, there's some coins over here and I'm grabbing the coins, and then I'm, now I'm in another battle arena. Um, and they really tried to emphasize that the game is split between strategy and exploration, but I didn't see the exploration, so they really have to that up. Yeah. Uh, I find it funny that in this isn't 'cause I voted for it for this category, but it Best Family Game is what it was left at, and it's Hidden Agenda. I don't know if that's a family game.

So like examples would be like singing games or like, you know what I mean, Rock Band or this, or is it going to be something like Jackbox Party Pack in Hidden Agenda, which we talked about on this, you know, Kinda Funny Games Daily before. Totally. I missed it, and for the most part of the show, and then when I went back and watched all the stuff and talked to people who played it, I was like, oh right, ****, this is awesome. A game from Supermassive, unfortunately revealed during that PlayStation pre-show that people were, weren't paying attention to. But Sony, the idea of an Until Dawn, it's one, you know, it's one of their, what are they calling them, the Party Play ones? PlayStation",

Uh, where you're playing with your phone and you're, you know, making choices together and then moving it around, and everybody gets Hidden Agenda cards, so you're playing and making choices based on that. It sounds fascinating, and I can't wait to play it, so I'm glad other people saw it and loved it as much as I like the idea from what I heard, I guess. Uh, number two, two on the Roper Report is Shawn Layden. Shawn Layden is saying the games can come out, come out whenever the hell they want to, and it doesn't matter. Over at Golem.de has this quote, \"Games are a bit of a business, and timing is very important. By the end of the year, people simply have more money. But it changed a little.

We can now publish the really high quality games almost at any time. It is difficult if almost at the same time a stellar, I'm sorry, it is difficult if almost at the same time a similar top game appears, as was the case with last year's business.\" Can big AAA games come out whenever, Andrea? 'Cause forever it was, you're coming out maybe in spring or you're coming out in the fall, and you're going to compete with everybody in November, and it's going to be a bloodbath. Yes and no. Yes, it doesn't matter the quarter that you come out in as much as it used to. We're seeing really giant tentpole AAA games being released in Q1 and Q2, where traditionally those were reserved for Q3 and Q4, in particular for holiday. But you can't",

But you can't just release them willy-nilly. You kind of have to look and see what else is coming out in that release window, because you don't want to stack a game that has a very similar competitor, you know, too close to each other. We saw this last fall with Battlefield, Titanfall 2, and Call of Duty all coming out within three weeks of each other, and clearly all three of those games suffered in overall sales because there was too much choice, and gamers, most gamers, can't afford to buy three games in a month. If you're a big shooter fan, you'd like to space out your $60 purchases. Absolutely. And so I don't think that they can come out whenever they want. There needs to be some thoughtful decision as to the, these release dates and some strategy involved, but I get what he's saying. Yeah, well, I mean, they've seen so much",

Yeah, well, I mean, they've seen so much success. You figure when you talk about Sony stuff, right, where Bloodborne was a, you know, late spring one. Uh, God of War is always over in the March area. Horizon, of course, was this super early spring. The Last of Us was right around E3 a few years ago. They, you know, for the longest time, we as an industry were sitting here going like, man, Sony's so ****, they got nothing for the fall, they got nothing for the fall. And it's just year after year with the PlayStation 4 worked in their advantage of they don't need anything for the fall because everybody's playing on the PlayStation 4. So let the third parties, let, you know, these third-party publishers duke it out and worry about, yeah, we're going to cannibalize each other's sales.

So it's like they clearly are marching to their own beat here, and I think they get to do it because they are PlayStation. Because yeah, who's going to, what is competing with Horizon Zero Dawn, right? Like it came out right before Zelda, but even when we got Zelda, we were all like, oh, these actually are different games. These aren't the same experience. I like them for different reasons, right?

And you know, that's an unfortunate place to be in from a fan perspective. From a business perspective, it didn't really matter to Sony because they, they don't see Nintendo probably as direct of a competitor right now, right? Because like, let's look at install, let's say everybody who owns a Switch buys Zelda. There's still way more PlayStation 4, and we saw that in the NPD numbers, right? That Zelda, despite its, you know, wide critical acclaim, everybody's saying, you know, shouting from the rooftops how amazing the game was, it just could not compete with how many boxes the other two guys own.

Wrote in to KindaFunny.com/KFGd, just like you can, and says, \"Kinda Funny Goddamn.\" So Shawn Layden says high quality games can be released any time of the year. Given how your years have gone, when is a good time for you personally to invest a, invest in a new AAA single-player IP? How about new multiplayer game? Are there ideal times? Are there bad times? Certainly ideal times.

But that being said, games are more portable now than ever, especially on consoles like the Switch. So why not release a big game in June, you know, like, you know, Batman was released and give people the summer to play through that. Well, that's, I mean, where I think the, for us personally, it's different, right? The holidays, I feel, are always not the best time. If it always sounds great, we're leading into it, and as a kid, it was Christmas break, it was this, I'm going to sit, you know, in the basement and play now that I have two weeks off school.

Like that was a really good one of like, okay, cool, it's not crazy holiday season yet, and it's not, you know, the rush of conventions are over. Actually get in here now, invest all these hours into and do something. Yeah, absolutely. I think September is a great time as well.
