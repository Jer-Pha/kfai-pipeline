I am Tim Gettys, and you submitted all of your questions over at Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames for me to answer, and I'm going to do that today. It's going to be a fun time. Now, the thing is, we posted this on June 8th, which was before E3, so I'm seeing a couple of these questions asking me about E3 stuff. So obviously, I already know what happened, so we're going to get ahead of that. We'll figure it all out. We're going to have a good time. Our first question comes from Thomas Layfield. He says, \"Hey Tim, the peak of the PlayStation 2 era occurred when I was in college, and between a lack of funds and a hefty GameCube catalog, I never owned the system.\" Oh man, that's a, that is an issue. \"If I were to purchased a PS2 now, what are a handful of games that didn't come out as PS3 remasters that you think I ought to seek out? Love you guys.\" That is a tough question to think about because most of the iconic PlayStation games were",

Love you guys.\" That is a tough question to think about because most of the iconic PlayStation games were remastered in some form, whether on PS3 or another locations. Uh, obviously there's the Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts I and II. Those were both remastered on the PlayStation 3 or 4, three and four actually, for both cases. Um, so those are kind of the big Square games. Metal Gear Solid II and III also were released as uh, remasters on PlayStation 3. Grand Theft Auto, I think the thing that you missed out the most on would have been the Grand Theft Auto III Trilogy. So GTA III, GTA Vice City, and GTA San Andreas. Those were shockingly never remastered on the PlayStation 3, but they were remastered on iOS, which sounds weird, and it is weird. But if you can figure out a way to use a Bluetooth controller on your iOS device, whether it's iPad or iPhone or whatever the heck, and this same is true for Android,",

But if you can figure out a way to use a Bluetooth controller on your iOS device, whether it's iPad or iPhone or whatever the heck, and this same is true for Android, Google Play or whatever the hell they call it, um, that is a good way to go there. There's also the PC collection, so there's, there's many ways to play those games. Um, I recommend that for sure. I feel like especially Vice City is like required gaming uh, when it comes to PS2 era. You agree with me on that, Big K Dog? Miss Vice City is required reading for PS2? Oh yeah, 100%. Oh my God, it's so good. So definitely think you got to get in there. I'm just trying to think of like the, the big iconic PS2 games. They were all remastered there. I'd say Devil May Cry is up there, and that was remastered, so now you can play it there. Kinetica is not on the list of must-plays, unfortunately.

Do you know the funny story about Kinetica is I've always wanted to play it and you never, you never would let me. Yeah, and eventually realized, not I never let you. It was, there was always issues. There was one time I had the box but a different game was in the box. Sure, that was a disaster. Guess where Kinetica is right now? Is it right there? Yeah, it is. You can play anytime you want. I, that's the thing. So there was a lot of games during that era that were great, like Downhill Domination or Kinetica or um, uh, the God of War games actually come to mind, but those, the God of War games were remastered, so they're already there. Um, but there's a lot of these one-off games, The Simpsons, that you probably wouldn't have ever gotten to, but I don't necessarily think you need to go back and play.

But those were multiplatform, so if you had a GameCube, you did probably experience those basically the same. The option was all of PlayStation 2 exclusives that were not remastered. I'm kind of having a hard time. The Jak and Daxter games, The Sly Cooper games, the Ratchet & Clank games, those were all remastered. The Prince of Persia games were multiplatform and remastered. Let me do a quick Google search. Doing some Google search, looking on Google. PlayStation 2 exclusive games. Business Insider's 100 best PS2 exclusive games of all time.

God, why, why has it been so long? So long, man. Business Insider, get your heck together. I hate this damn, oh, Business Insider, hecking uh, with the uh, ads. I have to open it up and, okay, so Okami, but no, Okami was remastered. Katamari Damacy, I'm not sure if that was remastered. I don't think it was. I actually missed out on those games myself. Kingdom Hearts, like I was saying, the Jak and Daxter games, Metal Gear Solid, Shadow of the Colossus, and Ico. Those are huge ones, but those were remastered. God of War was remastered. Yeah, no, honestly, I think you're good. Luckily, Sony did a really good job of making sure that the, the games that could have been, could have been stuck there, made the jump.

See, I don't want to say someone like Master Chief because I feel like there has to be at least some history, and Master Chief never had beef with Nintendo, even though there was like, that was past the mascot era, so it wasn't like people were pitting Mario against Chief in the way they did Crash and Sonic. I mean, we already got Mega Man, Pac-Man, Ryu, Cloud. Who the heck would? God bless Super Smash Bros., they made it happen. Um, yeah, Simon Belmont, Crash Bandicoot. We had Solid Snake. That's hecking weird. Trying to think of the most iconic game characters that are not already in Smash Bros. Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk? Yeah, no, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't add Tony Hawk.

Jason Bond says, \"Do you think Nintendo Switch games are going to be under the mobile and handheld category at The Game Awards?\" Nope. I think The Game Awards are going to change how they title things or kind of categorize everything, and they'll figure it out. I'm not too worried. Um, what I'm interested in is thinking about this Switch lineup at the end of the year when it comes to the Game of the Year time. Like if Mario Odyssey is as good as it's shaping up to be, it's going to be a freaking battle between that and Breath of the Wild, as well as all the other amazing games that come",

Good Lord, what a, what a year, what a damn year. John Burleson says, \"What do you think will be in store for the year Dreams 3: Tokyo Drift brought to you by Gatorade?\" We did our predictions episodes for the E3 show. I predicted a lot, a lot of get hyped moments. I was disappointed by most. I didn't get uh, the Devil May Cry 5 or the Remake, or all these things that I was like crazy, or the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale or cart racer that I was dreaming of. But we did hear that Metroid Prime 4 is actually happening, so get hyped, son. Morgan K says, \"Hey homie, do you think you on,\" he wrote this word, \"do you honestly think that we'll get a Pok\u00e9mon game other than Pokk\u00e9n on the Nintendo Switch, or should we all stop holding our breath?

He's really cool.\" He is really cool. And guess what, Morgan K? Thanks to the beauty of time travel, you got what you wish for. We're getting a mainline console Pok\u00e9mon game on the Switch in the future. It's going to be hecking awesome. That's all we know about it is that it's coming, and it's not coming next year, so we'll see. But I'm very excited. Will it be different than the other Pok\u00e9mon games we've experienced? I don't know. I can kind of see them sticking to the tried and true thing, just up in the ante a bit. I mean, even when you look at Sun and Moon, like who would have ever thought games would be Pok\u00e9mon games would be even that 3D? Like the console",

Like the console Pok\u00e9mon experience we all wanted on N64 was essentially beat by Sun and Moon when you're thinking about it graphically. So I don't know, it'll probably be bigger. I don't think we're going to get a Witcher 3-esque Pok\u00e9mon game, although heck that would be awesome. But I do think it's just going to be more the same, but bigger. So we'll see, but that excites the hell out of me. Jack Simpson says, \"Hello from Australia, Tim. Since there's been a lot of PS2 and PS1 Classics poured out on the PSN as of late, were there anything in particular you hope for from that era to play on your PS4? Thanks. P.S.

I mean, there's a lot of, of games that I feel like, and we were just talking about this in the last couple questions, but I feel like a lot of games are stuck in that era, and we're never really going to get them again because of licensing issues. I'd love to have the original Amplitude back. Um, NBA Street Vol. 2, the OG Tony Hawk games. I, I would love to just be able to pop back in and just play them again. Like the, a lot of the fun arcadey games that I feel like, not that they've aged perfectly, but are still fun today, would be great to go back to. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is a great example, and we've seen that game have such licensing issues where it came back and it was taken away, and then came back again, and then taken away, and that kind of sucks. But I don't ever foresee a future where that issue will be solved, so that kind of sucks. But hey, we're going to get them in some way or another. Spyro, gotta believe we bring back Spyro now.

They post at the end of the month, the final Saturday of every month these go public for people to see. Nicholas Price says, \"What is your most cherished memory as a gamer? The moment you look back on with the most love? For me is playing Super Mario World with my cousin and sisters for hours at a time. Thank you, you're the heck best.\" Um, I feel like there is two very distinct answers for me to this question. One of them is realizing that when I beat World 1, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, the first game that I ever owned, first game I ever beat, uh, but beating World 1, I thought I beat the game, and I didn't.

And once it went to World 2, and I realized there was six worlds and I had so much more game to play, that blew my mind in such a way where I was never the same again. I realized that I loved video games and that there was just a magic to them and an emotional connection I had had with them that I would carry with me because I, that later that day I went to Great America, which is this theme park we have here, and it's the theme park closest to us, so I have a lot of fond memories about that. But I remember, and especially when you're a little kid, theme parks are the most magical things in the hecking world.

The other one would be my early high school years playing Halo 1, uh, with all of my dudes in my, my friend Curran's house, and it being 16-player Capture the Flag where all of us were in the same house, divided up in two rooms, and it was just the most intense experience 'cause it took that couch co-op to the next level of it being multi-room warfare, and the amount of heck being talked where you could hear the other people screaming when they had the flag.

Let's imagine a future where you're making that Burnie Burns money, and you've vinyl wrapped your Prius to look like Brian Spilner's Nissan Skyline. You're throwing a lot of references here.

If I already collect games, I mean, I'm lucky that I already own all the games that I'm like, I need to freaking have that. But in terms of stuff I don't have, I don't know that this seems like kind of a cop-out answer, but I'd love to have mint, in box, original copies of Crash 1 through 3 and Crash Team Racing.

I'm not getting into it for the money, obviously, but because of passion. However, reality is reality, and money matters, especially if you have to live in San Francisco or some other expensive city.

Uh, games journalism doesn't pay heck, so that kind of sucks. Having said that, you deserve to get paid more than heck, and there are a lot of games journalists that get paid significantly more than heck when they stand up for themselves and make a pro, a positive case for themselves. I think that too often, uh, games websites and games platforms, whatever, whatever the hell they are these days, I don't even know, take advantage of the fact that people, it's people's dreams to work for them, so they're like, \"Oh, they'll work for free.\" And they will, and they will work hard for free, and then eventually they will get paid minimum wage, and then eventually they'll get paid a",

And especially like, just coming from E3 and just seeing how hard everyone works and knowing how hard our team works and everything, you're asking a lot out of people. Now, having said that, there is something to be said about the fact that the, these dreams do exist because other people put in a lot of hard work, and you can't just jump in and expect to benefit and reap the rewards and financial stability that these other people created and laid out for you.

So to them, they're working harder than everyone else, and how come this person gets paid this much? Don't play that game.

And, and well then, so once they're aware, then you have to make them aware, \"Hey, I want to get paid more.\" Yeah, you know. And it's like, working for free can work sometimes. It often doesn't. So it's just, it's balance, knowing who you're working for. Yeah, like, will this all pay off at the end? Is important. Yeah, maybe or maybe not. And I think that's the other thing too, is it's like, this is crappy, but nobody owes anyone anything.

And I think all too often people think too highly of themselves and their worth because they hear other people say, \"Hey, just do,\" like even what I'm doing now, I'm like, \"Oh, just do whatever you're worth.\" That's not how it works because when you do that, other people are looking at you and judging you. What it comes down to is every single thing that you do and every word you put out there and every friendship you make or break is all adding into this giant story of you trying to sell yourself. And I think that when it comes down to it, people, it's, it's kind of like playing a Telltale game, \"Blank will remember this.\" You know, you, and you need to think about that with every uh, career move you make.

So sometimes it is about paying it forward and knowing that you're not getting paid what you deserve up front because one day you will. But that's only with the right people. Otherwise, it can turn really dark really fast. Um, just try to find a good team. I think that's the best advice I can give is find people that you trust. Uh, I was lucky at IGN where I had a group of people I could look up to, like Nick for example, and uh, my other friend Eric and Darren, who were above me, and I could look at them and be like, \"All right, what did they do to get where they're at?\" And I saw a lot of other people that were in the same class as me kind of just fall by the wayside and never move up because um, they, they weren't playing the game",

Um, I don't know, sorry, I'm getting really long-winded here, but I, I definitely think there's a lot there, and you should always think about what you're doing. And if money is the biggest factor to you, games journalism might not be the right choice. Um, but if you want to do something you love and get paid adequately, if you work hard enough, you can make that happen. One second, I just got a Slack. I want to figure out what's going on. Nothing important. Cool. Um, Stephen Austin says, \"Hey Tim, I've, I think I've missed every Q&A since it moved to this new format, but I'm still here. This year has been extremely busy in terms of game releases, and Kinda Funny's schedule has been equally busy. Are there any games you have missed so far that you really want to get to?
