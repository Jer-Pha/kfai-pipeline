Shadow of the Colossus is bigger than Monster Hunter. Uh, but it's okay, cool. Those were the games we expected to see, awesome. And it sucks that none of them are coming this year. Shadow of the Colossus is the one thing that can even make this slightly qualify for Year of Dreams material. Yeah, I agree. Excellent conference, but nothing special. I think it was, I think everybody's been doing solid conferences. I think this was the best conference so far. Like, I think far and far and above everybody else, to be honest with you. And I think it, I really do think it was a Shadow of the Colossus moment for me that was like, I, this was, this came out of left field. Nobody saw this coming.

Uh, but that, they, I saw what I wanted to see. There was some people in chat saying like, what a boring conference. Like, you're fucking crazy. This conference was really good in my opinion. Yeah, I also agree that I think this is far and away the best conference that we've seen so far. Uh, I think I say that because I thought the Bethesda was really impressive from a presentation standpoint, but we expected a lot of things there. We expected a lot of things here, but they all looked great and there was a couple surprises and the presentation was just as tight. I, there was no orchestra, but I like that they one-upped it in a different way where all the games had their own",

Like, I, I really enjoyed that and they kept it tight. Uh, usually Sony's conferences, if I remember correctly, a little longer than this, usually. Yeah, 90 minutes happens quite a bit. Yeah, so this, this was kind of just like, let's get in, let's keep punching. I like that Sea was there, uh, once again, kind of being the figurehead, like three times. Yeah, he popped up. Yeah. And, uh, you know, I mean, like, looking at this list of games, I want to play them. See, I think I, that's my thing about it is I don't think they won far away. I want to stew a bit. We have a lot of E3 left in, obviously, Nintendo's presentation tomorrow. I feel like it",

Was yesterday? Oh, and you gave them a 10 out of 10 for presentation, right? And I think, I think that this is possibly another one where it was another one of like, here we go, full tilt, da da da da da. But I mean, I don't think they far and away won it. I mean, you know what I mean? Cause I think it's the same thing where there's, they missed the, they didn't stick the landing again, like we talked about so many times. Where was the, here's the game, here's the release date, here's the fucking news you need to know that like, we're so stoked to tell you. Everything's 2018, which isn't bad again.

Superhot VR in 2017. There's stuff I care about that's coming. It was just one of those that I don't think far and away they got. I don't think they pulled so far ahead of the pack. I just think that it didn't take much to be far and away ahead. Like, I don't think this was a perfect, oh my God, Year of Dreams press conference. Oh, yeah, I agree with that. But I do think that, uh, when you look at the things as a whole without putting numbers on them, I think that it's somewhere in the middle where even the Bethesda would lie of like, that was a good ass conference. It was good. Start with Horizon DLC. Started with, um, what was the first showing? First thing was Uncharted. First thing",

Guess I'm speaking just from my perspective. I wanted to see more about Detroit and that's what I, I want to see more Spider-Man. That's what I got. Days Gone impressed me, which I, I've been kind of down on Days Gone. My thing about it is I want to try to separate my own personal feelings versus everything. This is the conference that had the most games I was interested in. This is the one that from start to finish, I was like, okay, cool. Even VR, I was like, yeah, what is coming to VR? You know what I mean? I want to know that they delivered on that. Exactly. But I mean, like, I don't think that you, I still want, there's still something to be said for Xbox saying we have four",

Xbox, of course, marred by the fact that, okay, the Scorpio cost too much for this, that and the other. But PlayStation marred by the fact of still no Heavy Rain, Detroit date, no new dates and stuff. Like, there was a lot of misses and there was a lot of things that weren't here that people would want. I was, I'm shocked that Death Stranding wasn't in some way here. They said that, but then kept bumbling around. That's what I'm saying is just like, I, I, I did expect that. Um, we didn't see that. Obviously, no Last of Us, which I, I don't think is that big of a surprise, but still would have been fun to see. Um, there wasn't any crazy revival of a franchise, which Sony's kind of been known to do in the last couple years, unless you count Shadow of the Colossus, which I kind of do.",

Now, let's talk about Shadow for just a second. I'm very, very, very excited about it. They released the remastered version of Ico and Shadow last generation and I skipped out on it because I was like, I, I don't need to replay. I played Shadow of the Colossus, I think, a little bit later. It came out 2005. I don't think I got to it till like 2008. Um, so I was like, I don't need to to jump back into this now. But now or in two years, yeah, I'm so, so about that remake from the ground up. Fucking make the controls good. I'm hoping, I'm hoping that they, this is them learning from, uh, Last Guardian and understanding that that game was a a game stuck in a different era. And I hope that now they're like, all right, we know that Shadow was our best game. Now we're going to modernize it and you know, all the the Colossi that didn't",

I hope that they get them in here and really make this the definitive Shadow of the Colossus' experience so that hopefully like guys like you that know how important this game is, but never really clicked with because of things like the controls, maybe it can like resonate with you a bit more. 100%. Yeah, but I think it's, this is one of, you talk about expectations running wild, right? And that always setting up maybe unfair, unrealistic ones. But then Sony's delivered so many times with it, right? No Bloodborne, no update on Final Fantasy VII, no Sucker Punch. Like, yeah, no Sucker Punch. Sucker Punch, I'm really surprised at. I thought this would be the time of to start, you know, they've set up all these dominoes that they started to tip over with the first party, right?",

When you talk about, well, Uncharted 4, then but, you know, Horizon, have the next Uncharted. But there's all this other stuff coming or exclusives, I should say, I guess. And so like, you want to start looking and padding it, right? With Death Stranding's way out there. Now we don't need to worry about it. You'd think you'd, you'd have something from Sucker Punch to say, this is what's coming next. It's interesting. Yeah, it's a bummer when you look at it that way because, well, it's unfair. I mean, I mean, there's also, but then again, there is PSX. And I, I don't like using that as an excuse because E3 is E3 and let's kick ass. And I do think that they kicked ass.

You have to catch up to the times that you have to catch up to those games that are like that they gave a peak, a sneak peek at last year, you know? And God, I just want Spider-Man now. Yeah. And well, I mean, that was my thing when they, when they kept it to the end and they'd done other stuff. I was like, fuck, are they going to, they say Spider-Man this fall. Yeah. Yeah, man. I mean, okay, well, Spider-Man, I personally think that looks fantastic. That game speaks to me so much. It's Uncharted mixed with Spider-Man. I'm all about that. And some ARH.

Like, whatever's in the bottom right of the screen, those are the combinations you're supposed to hit to make the cool thing happen.

Um, they showing you that Uncharted so good at making you like, oh my God, oh my God, when like the cars are chasing you or whatever. You feel like you're part of the action. You do feel like you're controlling it, even though it is just kind of a movie that you're lightly interacting with.

You're just kind of fucking around in New York City and flying around and hanging out with Carlton Fisk. What's his name? Wilson Fisk. Idiot. Also, hey, during that live show, we were talking about where they did Everybody's Golf. Knack II was confirmed for September 5th. September 5th, Knack II. So there are games coming.

But, um, one, one of my least favorite Spider-Mans is the of like, I'm working with S.H.I.E.L.D. and I'm working like, I have, uh, comms telling me what to do and all that stuff. So in the beginning, I was a little concerned about it. Uh, but then once it was clear he was working with the the police, I'm like, all right, cool. I like this is, this is the smaller scale Spider-Man I like. And, uh, that rumor of Miles Morales or whatever, that excites me a lot. Well, yeah, and being there at the end.

Okay, the the dude that in the, I don't know him. I'm not, is real obscure. Like, I've read a lot of Spider-Man comics and he hasn't been featured in too many. He's been in the more recent run that Dan Slott's doing. But, um, I'm totally sold on that game. Apparently, they said this fall for GT Sport, which if you're, if you're a Greg Miller, B-man, means it's not, it's going to slip the fuck out of there. Not going to happen at all. People point out that something we talked about earlier that missed here again, no Dreams, no Media Molecule is fuck, what is going on?

But like, good on them. Like, they really focused on it alongside these giant games. And Days Gone, I thought, look, Days Gone looked really good. Days Gone, like, I, you know, I was one of the people who first off loves Sony Bend. But after that demo last year, when we're talking on the Gamescast predictions, right? I was like, that felt like a flat demo. It totally didn't hit what they needed to hit. It just looked like zombies and nobody wants that again. This demo was like, hey, it's The Last of Us.

I thought he was going to push the log onto them. Like, there was a couple of clips from Horizon where some people were doing that, but it was just a distraction. I guess he was hiding. I thought they did a much better job this year of showing the the crazy large amounts of zombies on screen at once, where like, using them as a weapon or using them to do things or also just the fear of sneaking around corners. Like, that is a lot more intimidating than this thing just being overrun and it feeling super. PumpkinPieAddict in the chat says, Media Molecule just tweeted, quote, good luck to all at #E3 this week.

I loved the, um, the lightly comedic aspects, like the that the other characters that were speaking. Yeah, I was like, oh man, I kind of like, yeah, I like this vibe. It's a, it's a lot fresher than we're used to with with God of War. It's just a lot of screaming. Um, and the the combat looked like it kept the things that I do enjoy from the original God of War and also it looked fucking rad. Yeah, I'm glad they brought in some lightheartedness to it. I'm looking forward to like, possibly as you're adventuring through all these big",

I'm looking forward to like, possibly as you're adventuring through all these big zones in like little settlement areas where there's a lot of friendly NPCs that kind of like, hey, you're Kratos, aren't you? Like that sort of shit. Like that's the stuff I love in video games. Like again, bringing it back to fucking Breath of the Wild, when you're just running around everywhere and you finally get to like your first like Kakariko Village or whatever, or or Hateno, whatever it was called. I just love seeing like little, uh, little safe havens in video games. And I think we're going to get a lot of that too. Like they hinted at it in the God of War thing where he picks up that, uh, vase or whatever the hell you want to call it and it had his image on it and stuff. It's like, I like that he's just kind of just this old dude that like has a legacy and everybody's heard of him, knows what's up. Yeah, exactly.",

And I like the star quarterback can bring to this experience. Kratos, huh? Good to see you some shit. Um, Detroit looked super cool. Detroit was amazing. That demo really connected with me. And again, it was like building a thing. I'm like, oh, just put a fucking date and say like, fuck, November this year. I think that might be, uh, the my biggest let down. Um, this besides the things that aren't here, that's totally unfair to judge a conference on. But, um, this not having a release date is is a real killer to the momentum of what we needed from this conference. Not even just wanted or expected. Yeah. Um, because yeah, I mean, great. 2018 is going to be awesome. But Detroit's not even labeled as 2018. So who knows? Yeah, it's a weird year for E3. I think we're still going to be like",
