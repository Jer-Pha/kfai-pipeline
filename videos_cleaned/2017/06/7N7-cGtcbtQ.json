Um, er, yeah, I mean, just eras that you think were the best. So I have up here like a little website. The original cast was from 1975 to 1980 and that featured Aykroyd, Belushi, Chevy Chase, um, Gilda Radner, right? Awesome. Um, before we go into this, I'd rather just call out my era so you understand how hardcore I am. Yes, I was the Phil Hartman, Jan Hooks, Kevin Nealon. That's Dana Carvey. You know what I mean? Myers was doing the sophomore humor era is what they're calling it. The Hartman-Carvey era. I'd say that uh, yeah, Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, uh, Lovitz. The names. What are the era? Yeah, give us the era. This is this is the original cast moves on to Eddie Murphy era.",

Um, the year it almost Came Crashing Down is what they call that era. Al Franken, Jon Lovitz, Anthony Michael Hall. Anthony Michael Hall is thought of as like one of the worst. Anthony Michael Hall was on Saturday Night Live like as as a regular, as a regular. Yeah, yeah, no ****, his agent **** that up, didn't he? Dennis Miller, Randy Quaid were also on that as well. Uh, the Hartman-Carvey era, Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, uh, Lovitz. We just mentioned that. Sophomore, the sophomore humor era. Yeah, Jan Hooks team. Yeah, Jan, oh, Jan Hooks.

Um, the sophomore humor era, which is, you know what I'm talking about, one of probably one of my favorite eras. Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider. It's just nonstop. Chris Rock, David Spade. Um, my favorite era though is the next one, which is the Will Ferrell era. Uh, which is Will Ferrell, uh, Jim Breuer, Ana Gasteyer, Chris Kattan, Tim Meadows, Cheri Oteri, Colin Quinn, when he was on The Daily Show, or no, not the Weekend Update. Honestly, one of the worst Weekend Update. I like Colin Quinn a lot. One of the worst. He just was not meant to do that. Molly Shannon, Tracy Morgan.

Uh, yeah, Fred Armisen, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, Amy Poehler, Seth Meyers, Andy Samberg, Sudeikis. It's a good era. That's a good era. I feel like Kenan Thompson's been on the show now. I feel like he's only, when I think about it, I'm, oh, Kenan Thompson, he just got a start on Saturday Night Live. Like he's from Good Burger. Like he's been on there for three years maybe. But no, it's been like 10 years now. He's coming up on like the longest, one of the longest running cast members, right? Yeah. Um, that is also a **** phenomenal era.

Uh, they're kind of breaking it up, I guess, because they're looking at this post-Andy Samberg. Um, Fred Armisen, Bill Hader, Sudeikis, Taran Killam. This is where it starts getting pretty weak in my opinion. Uh, Jay Pharoah was on there doing his impressions and killing it for a while. Jay-Z though, the final era is the the Kate McKinnon era, the most recent. That's uh, McKinnon, Kenan Thompson, Sasheer Zamata, Leslie Jones, Kyle Mooney, Bobby Moynihan, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Yeah, here's, I'll talk to, there's many things to talk about.

I'm there chilling out, I'm at my house or whatever. You just have it on and it would just be on nonstop. So that's where I feel like I know so much of the Phil Hartman era, the Jon Lovitz era, all these different things. And it might be rose-tinted glasses, but I feel like, sorry, my apologies, this a, it's a, it's a very regional term. I feel like maybe I wasn't watching as hard hard as I am with a critical eye.

But like the era where I said, no, they suck. Jason Sudeikis, I love everyone's name you read there. I love and most of the actors on there now I think are great actor or great at the performances. The problem that I can't **** stand is when I used to watch the reruns on Comedy Central, it would be, I'm talking to you, I'm talking to you and you're the guest for the week and you, him as the guest, would look off and you'd clearly be reading off cue cards.

And I'm just like, what the ****, man? Like that's, it's, it breaks the the whole thing for me. Yeah, see, I don't think I've ever really sat and watched like with the intent of, hey, I'm going to watch Saturday Night Live tonight. My touchstone for Saturday Night Live has always been the compilations. So you see the best of. And so for the longest time, I'm like, this is the funniest **** show you've ever seen in your life, right? Because yeah, I don't know, I don't know where it was them.

That those people, BYOM, right? Is that right? I don't remember. Maybe. And maybe I'm getting that wrong. But I know they moved over to one of those cable networks and then they did the thing where they were peppering them out. There's going to be like one a day, one a night or whatever. And they started doing compilations. So I just eroded what it was where I felt like I felt invested in SNL because I watched so much of it. And then suddenly I wasn't watching any of it.

So you'd see those, you like, oh my God, that's hilarious. But you'd only see the 30 seconds of it. Like I remember you'd watch like the best Chevy Chase and he'd have like the, I'm not a shark, ma'am, I'm just, I'm just a dolphin. Oh, okay, she open the door, eaten. But then you go back and watch those skits and you're like, why are these so **** long? Oh, old, old, old, so long. Dan Aykroyd and like John Belushi and all that ****. Like there's comedic moments in there that are great, but it literally was like, was a 15-minute bit of them talking.

Um, I I love those. I think they're such a romanticized, that's such a romantic time though for me to look back and like there's a there's a great documentary and I can't remember, I've recommended it before to you guys. I can't remember what it is, but it's an actual documentary about National Lampoon. The title is like fat sick dead nearly whatever. But it talks about how Lampoon's was supposed to be that show. So if you're not familiar, you're familiar with Lampoon's, right? Yeah. Um, I I started watching this, I can't remember if I finished him.

And that ended up being Lorne Michaels came in and ended up making that Saturday Night Live and stole all these characters from from the Lampoon's radio show. So he stole uh, uh, Belushi, uh, Chevy Chase, all these people. And they went over. So he stole the performers, basically stole the performers. Sorry, but stole in doing so, de facto stole a show. But it's so cool to watch all those guys. Yeah, this is it. Uh, Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead. Oh, I thought you were talking about Sick, Fat & Nearly Dead. No, that's I I totally mix those two up.

Like you look back at early Chevy Chase and early Belushi and you're like, those dudes were like cutting edge, cutting edge. Even Bill Murray, uh, Bill Murray, genius. Eddie Murphy at the time, you talk about the Eddie Murphy era and then how it saved it. Like going back and looking at that guy and just seeing him, that's a star. You're like, well, this guy's got, this guy has something special. Um, and I think SNL's obviously still good at finding those people. But like to me, so I I love that original era. I think to me, the Dana Carvey, uh, Mike Myers, the Wayne's World era is probably the one that sticks out most because loved everything that spun out of that.

Well, I mean, that's why SNL, I think they were always the best at that. That always they, that was when I think of like great SNL bits that usually comes back to an election in coverage. You know what I mean? I think of Will Ferrell as George Bush and I think of Phil Hartman as U, Bill Clinton. Was it, was remember there was that awesome one?

He's like walking around taking people's food and eating it while explaining his tax plan while he's on a jog away from. It was great. But they would do that ****. Remember, remember the original, the original person I think was Chevy Chase when he was making for fun of Carter, Ford. Was it Ford? Because Ford I guess had a, I I know that I wasn't even alive when Ford was president, but Ford I guess would trip every once in a while.

She was there to **** crush it and you know, move on. Yeah, especially obviously now with YouTube and all that stuff.

And the RV and stuff. And like we'd bring, I'd bring friends and like to stay up to watch SNL, right? It felt you achieved a goal of hitting 10:30. You know, we do that like Kevin and I would watch Mad TV on on weekends and watch Stuart and all that stuff. And that was definitely thing like, we're not supposed to be up this late after Are You Afraid of the Dark? Hell yeah, man. And we just did it.

Whereas these sketches are happening, you just like, what are you doing? Like, what are you? Yeah, I feel like, what are you doing? I feel like that was very interesting and also a fascinating era because they realized someone around there was like, we need to sort of shift tactics a little bit to things that can be a lot more sharable online.
