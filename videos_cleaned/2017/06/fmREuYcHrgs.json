Oh no, MVMT Sunglasses start at just $70 with the option to upgrade to polarized lenses. Those overpriced designer brands will run you an upwards of $200. MVMT figured out that by selling online, they were able to cut out the middleman and retailer markup, proving the best possible price. If you've ever watched a Kinda Funny Barbecue, you know I do wear these. I do like them. They are good. I'm wearing them on my face right now. Look me in the eyes and tell me if I'm lying.

That gives me less anxiety. And B, we've got a bigger team, so we've got more people, more hands to help, more defined roles, which is good, which means that I can just kind of my scope of work for the show is a lot more defined, which again helps with my just like feeling of dread going into it.

Well, it'll be yeah, I mean, it'll be as it'll be challenging, but it won't be the just the sheer amount of work that goes. Failing to see the challenge. I I have him riding a VR bike game.

Um, both good and bad. Um, but yeah, but I think like, you know, obviously Dean's still a one-man shop, you know, he's working out there in on the East Coast. Um, and and uh, Frame Freak is uh, down in South America working. I want to say South America, maybe Central America. Um, they have a full team though and they have people they can they have extra resources they can tap into. And so, um, I think that there's pros and cons to each one of them. Um, but yeah, as far as timing was concerned and we bit a little bit of the bullet and saying like, look, we just need to subcontract this out, get these done, you know, at a at a a higher cost to us.
