Wednesdays will be we talk about the comic shit, yeah Comics, yeah it's things like that and my hope for this is the same hope that I have for all of our shows right as we continue to evolve these things that we get closer and closer to or not closer and closer our I think our shows are entertaining but we get the shows get more entertaining because they have a higher production value behind them because people can we can plan",
