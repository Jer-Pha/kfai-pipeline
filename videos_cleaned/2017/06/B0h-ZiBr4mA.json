No, they like, I asked, I get my medium. Yeah, I got my medium as well. And uh, it was way more than medium. Let's say that. I got my medium. Now, the last time I got it medium though, it was still not good. You know, last time they cooked it correctly and it still wasn't very good.

Two of my favorite steakhouses, real steakhouses in the city are Epic and Alexander's Steakhouses. And they are insanely expensive.
