So Tekken sent us Tekken 7, there's a sponsor video. We decided we know that we are the greatest Tekken players in the world, so why not have a tournament to see which of us friends is the best. I'm definitely top 10 in the world though. The the Tekken's tagline is the best fights are personal, so I thought we would get as personal as possible. So off right Andy, what are we going to do? Um so I think we're going to do Nick and I will fight and whoever wins from there moves on to the championship round. Okay then Kevin and Tim will fight, whoever wins from there meets Nick or I in the championship round. Should we do a loser bracket? Should we we should we need to decide the definitive ranking of the best Tekken players. We'll we'll put a graphic up, I'll help Kevin out with the graphic. Yeah, we'll figure it out. All right, I'm excited, let's get into I'm going",
