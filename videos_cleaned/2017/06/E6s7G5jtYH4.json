You you just got a behind closed doors demo of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. $40, August 23rd, right? I think it's 22nd in the UK, 23rd in the Americas, 22nd in America. All right, uh, 22nd America, UK August. So what did you see? Was there gameplay or was oh this yeah, this is this was nine, this was uh Chloe Frazer chopping it up as playing as Chloe going through and doing that. Yeah, they're in India, of course, the whole game set in India. Uh, they had the Eye of whatever and they were going to go and do the next part that led to all sorts of craziness. So it looked like Uncharted. It's totally Uncharted, which is awesome and amazing and what we all want from it, right? It was for me the action, the set pieces. I think it was more interesting the scope, right? This game not not that it's been in a weird place. They've talked a lot about it. We've had the release date now for a while, but it is the",

We've had the release date now for a while, but it is the fact, right? That okay, we is this single player DLC? Is it its own thing? It's his story. It's on PSN. It is getting a disc release as well. Now it comes with the entire multiplayer suite from Uncharted 4. It's like what exactly is this? And to watch it like I think they made a pretty definitive statement of you start it started with you know, Chloe and Frazer or Chloe and Nadine coming over the top of this thing joking around being like, \"Oh, we made it.\" And then they you know, \"Well, now what? We good? We got to figure it out.\" And they pull back back, give the control and of course they spun the camera to show you like, \"Look at this giant Uncharted Vista!\" Like this is the real thing. This is you know, you see that mountain, you can go there. I don't know if it's that. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But then you know, going down",

Yeah, yeah, exactly. But then you know, going down on the climbing and the jumping and then bantering. And for me that was the big part about it was the fact of I love Chloe. I love Nadine. And I know not everybody did in Uncharted 4 for some reason because some of you don't have taste. Uh oh wait, it was you. That's right. You didn't have that wasn't me. That wasn't me. Okay, fine. I thought she was fine. Fine. She was better than fine. Nadine was better than fine. In a franchise with such amazing characters, she was fine. She was stand out character. Fantastic. Who doesn't love Chloe? Yeah, anyways, they there was this great moment, right? Of like it it and this is the thing too of like what's it going to play like what spin the camera around? Oh, there's one of those rope things. Do it. Swing over there, right? Drop. Then it was there some enemies go into the brush that",

Then it was there some enemies go into the brush that Uncharted 4 stealth mechanic they added. But they did this great thing where they came to the side of the brush. The two guys are right there and Chloe's like, \"All right, you take the one on the left. I'll take the one on the right.\" And Nadine just runs out, grabs the dude on the left, breaks his neck. The other guy looks, she just like Shawn Michaels Superkicks him and and Chloe's like, \"That also works.\" It's like, \"Yes, that's the buddy cop. That's what I want. I want that Uncharted humor. I want that Uncharted action.\" So from a gameplay perspective, when we first saw this game at PSX last year, when we saw it, there was a moment where we weren't sure it was Uncharted because it looked a bit more like The Last of Us in terms of camera placement where the character's a bit bigger in in the screen from what you",

Is it more classic Uncharted or this looks like Uncharted 4? I didn't like that's a great point. I remember when we were watching that demo and it was pulled in tight for that walking segment when uh Chloe was shrouded and this one didn't give me that vibe at all. This one gave me straight up and it was like same things. It's Uncharted 4 again where it's like, you know, they were crawling doing this thing. They jumped. They slid down the you know, the mud or whatever off to the side and did that that crazy ass tank car showed up again and was chasing them for a while. But I like that it was playing with expectations of what you expect out of these, right? Where it was the okay, you take that per oh no, okay, you got him. That's great. And then there was another one where at the very end before it cut",

And then there was another one where at the very end before it cut to its cut scene, Chloe was climbing up a wall and that that car that they thought they got away from punched through the wall and everything came down. You know what I mean? Like they're taking the tropes of Uncharted and using them and it was interesting to get in there be like, \"Oh, I can so see the Uncharted 4 DNA here.\" But just having these two different characters makes it feel so different. And of course they've been vocal, you know, Arne had an interview a while back talking about how they it came out there like 10 hours. The story is so big or whatever where it's going to go. You they haven't confirmed what the final play time will be. It'll vary person to person, but it's got a platinum. It's got new trophies. It's got the Uncharted Suite. It's 40 bucks. It's on disc. It's on download. It's August like",

I'm just like, you know, all eyes on you. You're like, this is the big you're the big Sony first party again, you know, coming out this year. And I think they got it. I think this is going to be a game that will catch people off guard in quotes in the way of like, \"Oh, that Uncharted DLC.\" But then from what I saw, you're going to pop it in be like, \"Oh no, this is this is an Uncharted game.\" Thing substantial. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, but I'm excited. You should be too. I'm very excited. August, man. That's good. That's closer enough that it's like, \"Oh, that's right there.\" I don't want to see anymore. No more story trailers. No more of this like, \"All right, cool. I'm ready. I'm ready to get in there. I'm\"",

Yeah, Kevin, you're excited. Good. That's great. Yeah, no, Chloe was one of my favorite characters in the whole franchise. So the fact that she's in it, I'm really excited about. Well, you're talking about with me and Nadine in America. I think it's 23rd for you. I don't know. And Uncharted 4 that I didn't like is I didn't like what happened near the end of the game. Wasn't justified. Wasn't earned. Okay. But her as a character, she's fun. She's great. Okay, good. All right. Well, I'm excited for more of them. Yeah, so am I.
