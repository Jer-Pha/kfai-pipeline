In a chat with new trailer buzz via Batman News, Reeves explained that he was as much a fan of the DC superhero as a child as he was of the Planet of the Apes film series. Reeves also drew comparisons between the Dark Knight and the protagonist in the new Apes trilogy, Caesar. I see a parallel emotionally between Caesar and Batman in that they're both characters who are tortured and trying to sort of grapple within themselves to find a way to do the right thing in a very imperfect and to some degree corrupt world. And so that's really that emotionality that I'm interested in. He added, I want to do a very point of view driven.
