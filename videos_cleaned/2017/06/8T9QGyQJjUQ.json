How do you pee on, on this show that I do once in a while, Super Knock and Boots? Yes, we get into interesting territory all the time because we have a bunch of weirdos on that show. Yeah, you do. Damon and Ty are part of the Dicks Up Club. Yeah, which means that in their underwear, they like their penis to be up. That's weird, right? Or are you a Dicks Up person? No, okay, no Dicks Up.

How would you even, yeah, you put it up there and then over time it comes down. But no, you can do it with briefs. It could be done. Oh, yeah, briefs, I imagine. I think loose boxers is where it would get, yeah, it's just, I don't play that game. Okay, no, no, okay, I don't **** around. So now that, of course, I'm with you, I'm with the majority of normal human being, like that's a weird thing, Ty, why would anyone do that?

Okay, the softest **** underwear, and they don't, they've never sponsored us. The softest underwear in the world. I love these **** things so much. I pay a premium, of course, you can.

I'm a, I, I was boxers for a long, long time, and then I went boxers. No, I'm a, I'm a briefs man. And, uh, so I definitely experimented with that early in life, but I came back around.

What? Have you ever had your phone tossed in the urinal by? Oh, no, no, I dropped it in the urinal once. All right, if I want to, why you keep doing it then?

There, there's at least one story about that happening. But no, um, and after Abel came and slept for four days, there, there's a lot of sex in the Bible. Um, um, well, I mean, people had a kind of a more pragmatic attitude. You know, you live, there wasn't a lot to do in the world, so people were a little more pragmatic about it.

If you agree, subscribe here, like the video. There's nothing really to click on. Go support us on Patreon. Go watch other videos over here. Go check out Kinda Funny Games over there. We're doing a bunch of cool Let's Plays and stuff. Come to Kinda Funny Live 3. Buy a shirt. Why don't you support us on all the Patreons? Did you know that we have a Twitch thing? Maybe you should go there. Do you know that if you have Amazon Prime, you have Twitch Prime as well, and you get a free subscription every 30 days, and you should give that to us? Did you know?",
