Welcome back. Hey, thanks. How you doing? You know, I'm doing great. I think I'm finally pulling out of the E3 exhaustion. Are you? Yeah, see this whole week that I'd be adding to it for me and I just can't get away from it. More and more tired every morning. I've decided to launch a bunch of new stuff and overhaul your content the week after E3. Like that, that's what you know, that's one way of one edge if you could assign to it. High boarding point. What even do? I'm sorry, I'm just a mini-channel. What have I been playing? I actually played What Remains of Edith Finch. I love that game. Very first entry it is. Yeah, I'm going to talk about it on Most Good Games on Friday. Oh, if you guys want to hear about my thoughts, check out, let's go check out that show. Yeah, there's lots of cool stuff happening this week though.",

Yes, I'm young. There's been some interesting stuff come up. Yeah, a lot of interesting news. We'll jump into it right away. If you didn't know what it's gentlemen, this is Kinda Funny Games Daily each and every weekday. We could you delve into the biggest stories in gaming just for your amusement. You can watch a live over on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames as we record it. Sometimes there's problems and we don't know when we're kicking to us and stuff like that.

Why wouldn't you want that to be more accessible? Yeah, especially for something. I, there's the case of like, okay, well, you want people to play a game like Friday the 13th, like Dead by Daylight, over and over and over again, right? I get that. Make your show these mid-range hard where I, I'm going to have to play a month or more of this game, like, you know, not like obsessively, but, you know, after work, after work.

It wasn't a garble this time. They've been closed garble for the first two show. So that was at least a little bit better. I just never heard a news ticker before. We're going to start with Uncharted not being dead, maybe being dead. Who the hell knows? Over on Eurogamer, they talked to Lost Legacy creative director and writer Shaun, who I met for the first time, I believe. So I don't feel bad about not being able to pronounce last name. Do you know Shaun? Um, yes, we spoke at E3 as well. Do you know what last name? Shaun Escayg? No, I don't. I just you have Shaun Escayg. Shaun, we love you. Good job at Naughty Dog.

I your game ask, does this mean this talking of course about Lost Legacy? And I'm going to get into that a second. Does this mean Uncharted can carry on further without Nathan Drake? Do you consider this the end of its character stories? Shaun responded, I want to say at the end, this steaming world is huge. There are so many characters. Even before we settled on this particular story, we were exploring Sullivan, we were exploring Cutter and pairing each other up, thinking what would be right, what would have conflict, growth, something new, something fresh. And Chloe was the one that kept jumping out. But to say on the Uncharted world is done, I doubt that highly. It's interesting on so many levels because they made a big point when Uncharted 4 that it was the end of Nate's story, right?

And I think there was this belief of, well, what it before we played the game, how could you continue the story? How you can, can there be an Uncharted without Nathan Drake? And all these different things. People always point to the epilogue. Colin always pointed the epilogue and was like, that could be the, see, there's a million seeds for a new Uncharted. I just don't think, you know what I take away from, you know what I mean? But a saying Uncharted world is done, I highly doubt that. I highly doubt it too because I think nothing ever dies in video games. But I had a three years and years and years away, right?

It would be frankly asinine for them to throw it away at this point, especially since it's done critically well with each iteration, obviously some better than others. I mean, I'm really excited for the Lost Legacy. I've always said that I would love a standalone Sully game. I think that he's a fantastic character. I would love to see him, you know, have his chance in the spotlight. Of course, they're going to make more Uncharted games. I mean, obviously we all want to see what else Naughty Dog is going to do besides they know The Last of Us is coming out. Sure. But yeah, I mean, this makes sense. I mean, I don't know why anyone assumed that it was going to go away. It's not going away here.

Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells said the following in the interview with Game Informer, quote, I would say that Naughty Dog doing an Uncharted after this parenthesis, Lost Legacy, is unlikely. Now, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy creative director and writer Shaun Escayg is suggesting the series could continue with Naughty Dog being a wholly owned subsidiary of PlayStation or Sony's PlayStation Division. Sony controls the rights to the Uncharted brand. If Sony wants to make another Uncharted game, but Naughty Dog declines, dot, dot, do you think we could ever see an Uncharted game from another studio? Oh, absolutely. Do you think they'd do it though? I could we, yeah, thousand percent. You're met, you laid all out perfectly. I don't, I mean, like, the only matter, like, it's not like Naughty Dog has, you can do.",

But I feel like you'd go in there, be like, hey, we're thinking about doing this. Like, they gave Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier to High Impact Games and it was like, okay, cool. They were done with Jak. They had tried to do Jak and it didn't work out. And that's how they got on the road to The Last of Us in a weird way. So I, if they were, if they had any interest in ever coming back to Uncharted, I don't think you'd see them turn around, be like, all right, well, Sucker Punch, what do you want to do? Oh, I don't think they would maybe go to another high profile studio like Sucker Punch. But I mean, look at what you know, Vicarious Visions is doing with Crash Bandicoot. Not your, I was like, we're not going to do that. Yeah, so I think we can maybe see something along those lines, something.",

Yeah, so I think we can maybe see something along those lines. Something smaller, maybe a standalone, like, you know, short single-player experience. But I mean, we're speculating on something that's probably years and years away. Yeah, I remember after, you know, when Uncharted 4 was releasing, some of these same conversations came up and nobody had a clue that Lost Legacy was in the pipeline. You know, the kind of, you know, baton switched and like, oh, Uncharted is done. We're putting this story to bed. They didn't hint at all that like, you know, this great story between these other characters was coming up. So could that be the case here? Absolutely. I feel like when, when you, when we talk about Sly, you know, them coming back and like, okay, cool, since I was going to do this Sly Cooper game, all right, there's, they're going to check in. You're going to do the remaster release of Jak or whatever.",

And I, and I think that Uncharted is, with all due respect to the franchise I just mentioned, too important to give to all right, second party studio. They want, we want, we want somebody to make an Uncharted game, you know what I mean? We want you to go do that because I think what they, I have here is the ability to sit on the Uncharted franchise for a few years. And either when we get to the PlayStation 5 lifecycle or whatever, and you need a big E3, you close with, you know, Sony Interactive Entertainment presents. And then it's the Naughty Dog logo and it's like the whooshing sound or whatever. And it's the, it's the epilogue grown-up a few, you know, but it needs, you need time to sit.",

We jump ahead here in my notes on this story because I have stuff here at the end here sort of to do because they're talking about The Lost Legacy, right? And they're talking about how this is how it goes. So here we go. It feels like, yeah, okay, if this is back to being the Eurogamer part, it feels like you've made a conscious decision for Lost Legacy to come out at a certain price. It's not the same cost as Uncharted 4. It's, it's more than most DLC, somewhere in the middle. What would you say to fans? What would you say to fans who aren't still are saying it's still not worth the money? And then Shaun says, it's a full game. It's kind of the sum of all the Uncharted. It has a fantastic set.

We've brought back some of the scale, the grandeur you saw in the trailer, giant archaeological sites, the sense of wonder and adventure where you're not sure what's around the next corner. For me, Uncharted has the sense of, oh, ****, we're exploring someplace no one's ever been. We brought that back here. What I want to point out is that I think, and this is weird and sad, all of Uncharted 4's multiplayer is working with that game. My point with this after seeing more Lost Legacy at E3, talking to Audrey Agra for a while, is the fact that not only myself, but I feel the PlayStation community audience in general has been sleeping on Lost Legacy. The fact that it is a $40 game coming out August 22nd. It's on adjust to it. It has all the multiplayer in Uncharted 4. It's rumored to have be 10 hours. It has a.",

I think they set it up in a way that we're all expecting, oh, this is going to be an hour, two of Sully or young Drake or whatever the hell it would be. And the fact that this is, I think, the test case for the new, hey, could Uncharted continue on without it? And I think that it's going to work for and against them in a way that I think a lot of people are going to ignore it. Anything else just DLC. And then people are going to get on board with such low expectations. Really? Do you really think a lot of people are going to ignore it? I don't think that at all.

Yeah, Left Behind not doing as well as should have in terms of The Last of Us DLC. Okay. It would also be the fact in this, this speaks more my second part of like such low expectations in the fact that when you went to the PlayStation booth, right? You're seeing game, we gave our game of the show to Insomniac's Spider-Man. It's all over Detroit: Become Human. It's all over God of War. Naughty Dog had some, but they didn't have them in the same way they did when it was Uncharted 4 because for this, I think people are looking at it going, oh, it still think that's really cool.

That's actually cool. Well, I think that's great for Naughty Dog. Low expectations mean they can hopefully impress. I agree. I just hope that like, it's one of those, if I just want, I don't want to be ignored by the audience and then have that be the reason that there isn't an Uncharted Cutter game or there isn't an Uncharted Sully game. I mean, I have to imagine if Uncharted is actually tracking to make a new game, like a full, like Uncharted, you know, whatever subtitle game, not Uncharted 5, obviously that, that's already in the production.

Q, what's going to happen with Dreams? Ah, couple interesting points from that. This interviewed was Shaun. Round it all out. They asked him about open-world games, right? He gave a quote about and says, when we find a way to do things in an open world, I think we'll definitely venture there at some point.
