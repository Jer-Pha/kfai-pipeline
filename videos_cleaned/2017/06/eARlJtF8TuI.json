The P is that song racially insensitive? Hold on, I do not have the Twitch chat open. I need to know. Oh yeah, is it 100%? That's heartbreaking. I think that's right. That's like finding out Christmas is racially. Was a techno version featured in the 1995 Power Rangers Movie? Okay, did they use the do they did? But it was a different time. Everything. I mean, 1995. I bring it back, guys. What is the other? We took some of racist thing back, didn't we? No, no, no, no. That's based on a joke that was told in a standup set last night that no one else was at. Oh man, let's see. People saying you good. Oh, it's in Scrubs, man. **** Scrubs. Tim, stop. It's not me. Let's just the world. We'll go to Google. Are the Asians Kung Fu Fighting? We're not. No, we're not racist. Uh, Andy at work says, 'Am Asian confirmed. Don't give a crap.'

That's not the same thing, Dog. Osio Rohos also says, 'As a minority, I say it's okay.' Kevin, can I get a Minority Report on Kung Fu Fighting? I'm gonna say it's still okay. Kooby Studios actually brings up a a point. I'm not going to say a good point, but says, 'Tim is racist for assuming Kung Fu, long story, race.' I guess there's an NPR story here from 2014 that says how the Kung Fu Fighting Melody became came to represent Asia. They don't see. I just want everyone to know that I never brought up any race.

You just, oh my God. Other than Bomberman, a game which we are well aware of its heritage and how loved it is, and Castlevania is, Jones said. So much so that Castlevania is getting its own show on Netflix, and because of that, we're hearing a lot of desires from our fans for a new Castlevania series. Scroll down, K. So we do know there is a demand for new game, but right now nothing is set in stone as the discussions are still ongoing. As for whether or not Super Bomberman R will make it to the Wii U, according to Jones, the answer is no. Good. Of course, the short answer is no. Who the **** will bring anything?

Yeah, why would anybody bring the Wii U? It's dead. Stop making Wii U games. Stop making 3DS games. Am I right? Yeah, you're to right now. Something to to take into consideration is Super Bomberman R on the Nintendo Switch is by far the bestselling Bomberman in at least the last 10 years, which I know isn't that crazy impressive because 10 years is a long time and that would bring us back to, you know, the DS times and a little further than that long times.
