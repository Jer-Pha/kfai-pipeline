I'm at the Ver Zoom booth and I'm seeing their suite of workout games. Do I sound like I was partying on last night? I do. Is it cuz I was parting last night with Cool Greg? Cool Greg come in here. Come in here. See you didn't think you're going to be on camera so you didn't put this right. But it doesn't matter. Now get out. Now get out. We're about to jump in and I'm going to describe to you what I'm seeing in depth. Here we go. So we're starting off with the demo. Okay. So what's going on? Oh gosh. So right now I'm say I'm I'm starting off as a a cyclist. This is a cyclist demo but I'm not sure how to do it. Tilt your head. Got it. Got it. Got it. Cool. Do you have to keep your balance?

So the pedals themselves are obviously real pedals in in the bicycling world. You pedal faster you go faster yada yada yada. You understand how mechanics work of of the body. So I'm pedaling right now. But how you steer is with your head. So I'm steering. I'm just shifting and I'm out about to draft this You just got drafted dog. So I'm actually getting a little bit of a workout. And I'm drafting fools. I just got drafted. I got just got drafted. They call me the Lance Armstrong of video game players. Either that or the Lance Bass. I'm not quite sure. Are you still in the demo or you playing right now? I'm still in the demo playing the uh cycling. If I need this little trigger right here rings the bell. Again this bike is custom. You can buy this bad boy. They bring it to your house. They set it up for you. They",

They set it up for you. They give you a little smoothie. I don't know about the smoothie part. I'm not sure if they set it up for you or not. You can play some of the games they have on this. Or if you have your own exercise bike and you're just tired as a Soul Cycle like I am you can actually they sell a little attachment that goes onto the pedal and you can turn your bike into a fun machine like this. Ring the bell. Oh now we're going into a game called Thunderbolt where I play as a tank and I pedal faster to move the tank and then I turn my head to move the turret and then I pull this trigger to things up. Boom. You just got up bro. Boom. If this is how easy real war is you can call me a warrior or the road warrior or just the road for short. Nailed him. Ah So are you winning? I'm not sure if you win.

I'm not sure if you win. I think that I think everyone wins because you're getting exercise and that's the most important thing. Got it. Is that you just you know we all live sedentary lifestyles. That's why my lower back hurts a lot. And I'm done. I think I won. I'm not sure. And and now I'm looking at a screen where it tells me how long I was pedaling for my heart rate my calories cuz I got a little heart rate monitor right here. I burned three calories. Not bad. I would have not I probably wouldn't have burned three calories just sitting here talking. Am I looking at the camera? Where's the camera? Yeah you're looking you're good. Okay cool. So anyway that's uh that's my reacts to the Ver Zoom suite of uh workout games. It's super fun. I'm going to go get maybe like a hot dog or something else just to get that good",
