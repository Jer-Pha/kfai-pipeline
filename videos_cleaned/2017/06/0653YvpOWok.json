Uh, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Shuhei Yoshida. Grab a seat right there, Shu. Thank you for coming, Shuhei. Oh yeah, you need a microphone, don't you? There you go. Hello, there you go. Yeah, you know that I was one of the producers of the original Crash Bandicoot game, so I, I cannot be excited enough. I had a chance to play Crash 1, 2, and 3 on PS4 the other day and like they are saying, uh, they made Crash 1 a little bit easier because it's too hard. You know, I struggled as a producer, but uh, every level, well, stop right there. If you were struggling as a producer, yeah, I, you think about dialing down the difficulty. Actually, we did, we did for the Japanese version. The US and European version came out in September, I remember, but we had three months, uh, we released the first Crash game in December in Japan, so I worked with Mark and Naughty Dog guys to make, make it a",

Yes, as if I couldn't love the Hot Shots Golf / Everybody's Golf more, you put Shu in there. I got to play as you today, it was fantastic. Thank you, thank you. So I was, uh, at the booth and, uh, I, I saw someone playing as me and I was like, playing, you know, so how, Shu, how is Shuhei doing here? There, this is you right there. Oh, they're talking about it. How did that happen? Did they just come? Oh yeah, so the, this character was made just using the same, uh, edit, you know, character edit tool that they have in game, so you can create anyone.

And, uh, one of the PR person, you know, suggested, why don't we use just Shu's character for the E3 demonstration? That might attract, you know, people's attention just a little bit. Yeah, is it shipping with you? You're going to be in the game? Uh, it could be, yeah. I saw an audio, you want him in the game? Everybody's Golf. Uh, in the earlier version, I saw me as one of the galleries, you know, watching, uh, you know, people play. Yeah, you got to do it. I think, I think for the people who love Everybody's Golf, if you're a Hot Shots fan like me, you know, Shuhei Yoshida, it makes perfect sense. Thank you. So, Shu, how, how is, how has it been?

Yeah, did just Shawn Layden came, came, came up, you know, spoke for one minute and all the presentation was like, you know, video game, game, game. Yeah, yeah, so there's no like a technical issue that we don't have to, you know, worry, be worried about. And there's no like a switching people and, uh, so the, the, we didn't have rehearsal. Yeah, there's just one run through at, at the, you know, night of the day before, night before the, you know, show. That was it. We didn't do any rehearsal on the same day. So, 'cause we had hit play pretty much, right? And walk off. Pretty much. However, however, if, uh, um, yeah, you were in the auditorium, right? No, I was watching from home, Kinda Funny.

Yeah, you, yeah, you hired real people, hang like zombies. Yeah, scary. So all those things, that water came down from the ceiling and became the display. Just so, so amazing to be inside. You guys nailed presentation last year with the orchestra, this year with again, more live music, the water. It was amazing. Yes. So how did you feel about your games lineup? Um, pretty good. Yeah. How did you feel about PlayStation's games lineup? Thank you, thank you. Yeah, so, um, the, if you had noticed, we had to put many of our games coming out this year in the pre-show of E3 Media Showcase because we wanted to make the actual show within one hour.

We, uh, aired, uh, live right before the, uh, E3 press, you know, uh, uh, Media Showcase. And it's, it's on our YouTube channel, so please watch. There are lots of new information about Everybody's Golf and Gran Turismo and PlayLink and all these games. So, found interesting. No Patapon in there? Where was he? Where, you know, where's coming? It, it better come quick. All right, the local Roo's out. Good for them. Now give the people what they want. They want Patapon.

I'd be very offended, you know, if it wasn't preserved, if it came out and it wasn't what I want. Yeah, you, I would let you know. Thank you. That and the, the golf game, you know, that, you know, these are like, you're talking about this, my, you know, a decade in the industry. We're literally reliving like the 2007, 2008 PSP era that I like, that I love so much, 2007, 2008. So I'm stoked with what you. But, but talking about Everybody's Golf, did you notice that this time around we have put, the developer was able to put nine holes together in one break?

So you just see other people, uh, wandering around while you are playing the golf, or you can watch other people play, uh, in online. And you, you can clap or you can do, you know, some, you know, dancing, other players. I expect you to be dancing for me when I'm, when I'm playing golf. Yeah, yeah, so it's a very live, you know, golf game. It's like an open world golf. Oh yeah, I can't wait to do it. I can't wait to get hands on with it. I get like deep hands on with it.

Um, like Gran Turismo Sport coming Fall 2017, God of War coming early 2018. Because, um, we had, uh, announced, uh, release dates of many games that we had to apologize and push back in the past. So we and got together, um, and discussed seriously because the PS4 games are so big and, uh, all the teams, you know, very veteran teams making games for the last 10 years still miscalculate how much work is done at the very last part of the development, being, you know, polishing or debugging. Uh, so we agreed to not to announce a release dates until very, very, very, very close to the release date. So that put a lot of challenge to our marketing and the sales",

So that's the reason that we didn't announce the actual date. Is that, does that make it a, a really tough decision on what to show when? Like to, you know, to show something like Days Gone last year and show it again this year and not have a date or anything like that, which is fine. Eric Jensen working his, his butt off, I understand. But I mean, is that like, it feels like you guys have had a change strategy, I guess? Um, well, so we have, uh, you know, uh, portfolio games, you know, we are in development. And, uh, we share that with our marketing and the PR teams.

So, yeah, so where are you strategizing to play Sucker Punch's game? 'Cause I'm sick of not seeing it. I think it was two years ago on this stage, you told me you had played it and I still don't see anything about it. I, I think I have played many, many more times for God of War such game. And every time I, I, I, I shouldn't be talking anymore. Okay, I can respect that. So it's, it's a game. It is a game. Sucker Punch is making a game. They are not making movies.

I, I remember I was there at the very first one when the, uh, Steve Race came out and just said $299 and as you know, to announce the price of, uh, original PlayStation. That was a huge. So, so I think that was the very first E3. So I've been to E3 every year, every year. What do you think of this year being open to the public? That's, uh, lots of energy. Like, feel a little bit like, uh, PSX. You are there. Yeah. So, um, I, I, I think I like it in terms of the atmosphere and energy. Uh, but, uh, it's going to be much more challenging for like a media people to play games. And we have a media room, so, you know, hopefully they have, uh, have enough time to get their hands on the games. But, uh, uh, I, I hope people are enjoying. Are you enjoying being at E3?

So for you right now, what's it like to have so many games coming that people are super excited for, but then still to be able to come out and announce something like Shadow of the Colossus? Yeah, how long have that been in development? How long has that been thing? There was no, I had no idea that was coming. Yeah, so this is a complete remake of the game. Every asset, everything is, you know, made new for. We changing the control scheme. Um, we doing some tweaks. Okay, okay, I can live with that. I can live with that because it's been a long time since a very original game. And there are certain things that people like expect in terms of like interface.

However, to really recreating the game with the contemporary current gen PS4, uh, graphics and engines. So for people who have no idea about this game, our goal is to, uh, make this game look like any other new PS4, you know, brand new PS4 title. That's why we didn't put remake or anything in the title. We just call it Shadow of the Colossus. Uh, I feel I would be. So, sorry, sorry to answer your question.

So we're happy to get out there. But like for you, we talked so much leading up to it. How have you felt post launch for about PlayStation VR? Yeah, so the, um, well, from in terms of, uh, number of units, you know, we couldn't keep up with, you know, producing enough.

Uh, so there are challenges in terms of producing enough unit to catch up the demand. But now you go to the stores, you should be able to find, uh, the.
