You, you're in, you're in Paperboy, except it's not Paperboy. It's not Paperboy: Special Delivery. Don't start a lawsuit. It looks exact like asking for it, though. I mean, even the high fives are out, fist bumps are in. Like, that's a reference to, is it? I mean, is it a reference? Yeah, when you look at the the map and you see the the colored houses of yes and no. This is, uh, it's Paperboy. How are they legally allowed to do this? Got it. I don't know. I'm throwing my papers in here now. Got to steal with my head. Oh, you steal with your head. Oh, this sounds, this looks like a, oh my God, got him. Okay, cool. Got one. This is level one. Throwing them, I mean, willy-nilly. Oh, shoot. Yeah, I down to one. Yeah, oops. Okay, I play Paperboy before, Greg. It's been a long time. Go off that sweet jump. Oh, it's not a sweet jump.

Special Delivery comes of course from the final episode of PS I Love You XOXO when Jeremy dun and I discovered that this was coming and I got very excited 'cause you know, I would, it sounded like it might be easy trophies, which, you know, I'm all about. Now, I'm going to try to hit this garden. Didn't get them. Nope. Did not get him at all. See, if I'm being honest, like, I was excited about this, but looking at it now, oh my God, **** me. All right. Yeah, you weren't. Now you're not. Uh, no, it's this reminds me a bit more of Paperboy 64, what the ****, than of the original Paperboy, which is not necessarily a good thing, but we'll see. May, why did you like Paperboy 64? No, 64 was so, it would definitely not be a good thing, right? Like, yeah. Oh, oh my God, Jesus. If that scares me that much, it must really be. Get. Here we go. Nine deliveries, six my",

Uh, it's is, uh, rougher on the edges, as I think we expected after watching the trailer. Yeah, but I got to respect the PSVR game coming out with trophies. I I also appreciate that they really are just diving into the Paperboy, like the tornado. Obviously, who even has the rice paper? They going to come for. So, Midway made it back in the day. Midway's gone, if I remember correctly. That that was the logo on it. Okay, but I mean, who the **** knows what M they all. But I imagine there's somebody out there now that's upset.

Thread the needle. Okay, okay. It's making me a little sick watching this. Yeah, again, I'm twisting my body in ways I should not be twisting my body. You look like Kevin's mom when she played Tetris. There was a lot of motion going on. It was unnecessary. Yeah, well, I don't. It's the weird swaying of the head. No, grandma. God.

I wonder the legalities of that. I'm just being I'm straight up stealing something if the person doesn't exist anymore. Now, if you notice at the beginning of the game, it says it's compatible with the VirZoom, which I believe is that VR bike you can ride. That'd be an interesting one.
