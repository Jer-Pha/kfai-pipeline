And Jen goes, \"It's a gun.\" And I I thought it was a kid yelling pop like that. Some kids lost out the hallway. It all looks the same to him cuz he can't read. Hey, pop.

No it's because I gave her the card and I was super tired and I just wasn't paying attention and she she took it and had to take it back to the little chip machine put it in and then we were talking and then I just got my stuff. I was like well that was a very nice pleasant conversation with you ma'am. And I walked away. And then I got home and I was like I don't have my debit card. I'll never see that card again. Yeah. The only unexplained thing about that is how furious I got at the people on the other side of uh the phone when I called City Bank because they kept asking me the security questions and I kept answering correctly but it wasn't they weren't looking at the right account.

They're not gonna they're not going to be there probably the next time I'm there. They're not there to argue. And truth be told the people that I yelled at last time none of them worked there anymore. They don't even know that you're the guy. They don't care. You're the guy who swore.
