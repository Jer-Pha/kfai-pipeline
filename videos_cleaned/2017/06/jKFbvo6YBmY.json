Let's meet the Hispanic heartthrob, Andy Cortez. Hey, cool Greg over there, Big Kevdog over there. We are prepping right now to watch the Nintendo Spotlight for E3 2017 with you. We're excited, we are interested, we want to know what's going to happen. We are waiting for Nintendo to go live. They are just sitting there with this damn graphic, f***, twiddling their thumbs, these sons of b****, f***, with all their goddamn spotlights. I mean, to be fair, it's not 9:00 a.m. yet, guys. You know what? I'm just saying, I wanted to be ready, I wanted to be ready. I'm excited to see Mario, I'm excited to see what's up with the Switch. Your boy Luigi, there we go. Get hyped, turn that s*** up, pump it. Where's the remote? Bring me that distorted face, arms up, Fight Night, Fight Night. That, see that side eye though? What y'all",

There we go, FIFA 18 for the Nintendo Switch. No Journey for you, no cross. Go, let's go. Jesus, that shot was so unnecessary. There, you want to talk about a gift that's going to be used over and over again? These guys getting many sexual gifts. So many inks happening here. His eye, it was in his eye. Congratulations, Jeremy Dunham. Yeah, that's f***ing. I can't confirm. We have a demo book. Give me Reggie, give me Big Dog Reg.

What's that book? But the gameplay is also something else with chess in the back. I like this. It's a journey, a passport to new worlds, maybe even an odyssey. A look, a feel, an exploration. Close your focus and open your mind. Oh God, it's getting corny. Yes, the journey requires the right ticket and that ticket is Nintendo Switch. But in the end, it's not just where you can take your game, it's where your game can take you. So let's go, let's f***ing go, man. Just straight off the bat, you know Reggie. Mhm.

Elysium, you're a Blade. It's really, really, really tiny shorts. Put some clothes on of the Aegis. Get cold out there. It's not bad. Lore, can you take me to Elysium? I'm in. Let's go to Elysium. Whoa, where you got? I'll take you there myself. Pyra, here, cover me. Got it. Unnecessary. We'll show you. Yeah, we'll show you what me and Pyra are made of. Take this. Now that you have come this far, there can be no, no turning back. You and that sword can't be. I'm guessing your goal is Elysium. You really like that. Am I serious? There we go.

Is anybody Xenoblade Chronicles 2 holiday? All right, you okay with that? I mean, I am. That's, they're sticking to it, they're sticking to it. Sometimes you need a hero, a sword swinging, fire wielding, stone cold hero with an insatiable appetite. My dude, hers. Didn't expect a new Kirby game. We're about a four player Kirby. Didn't expect that at all. I hate how every time Nintendo shows a game for the first time, it's just some nitty ass soundtrack. Like, you know they're going to f***ing orchestrate it.

I'm Shinya Takahashi from Nintendo. I'm back on the hype train. I hope you've been enjoying the journey with Nintendo Switch so far. When I found out that Nintendo Switch is being accepted by video game fans from all over the world, a home console that could be taken with you anywhere, I felt so relieved. I had my doubts. Take Switch outside, come together, share experience. This idea was how we hoped people would play with Nintendo Switch. But people are coming up with many creative ways to play in all kinds of places, in many more ways than we expected. Oh, f***.

We hope there will be many heated competitions that will be ignited by Nintendo Switch. Now we'll continue our look at even more new game worlds for Nintendo Switch. But before we do, there is one announcement we'd like to share from our very special friend. Please take a look. Hi everyone, I'm Tsunekazu Ishihara from The Pok\u00e9mon Company. Just the other day, we announced that Pokken Tournament Deluxe is coming to Nintendo Switch. This is the latest version of the premier Pok\u00e9mon fighting game. Two people can dive right into battle using two Joy-Con controllers. There, a moment I thought they were going to do. You can experience heated Pok\u00e9mon just one Nintendo Switch console.

Game Freak has begun developing a core RPG Pok\u00e9mon title on Nintendo Switch. It may not release for more than a year, but we hope you'll look forward to it all the same. I just got chills. I want everybody in this room to know I just got chills. Any this year, we f***ing getting it. We all knew it was happening. Officially, a Pok\u00e9mon console game. We heard Pok\u00e9mon series is being developed for Nintendo Switch. What kind of Pok\u00e9mon game will we be able to play on Nintendo Switch? I'm looking forward to it myself.

Now let's continue on with the journey with Nintendo Switch. No, no, don't touch me. It's not happening. Star Fox. I think I might need, I might need the notebook again here, Andy. Oh, f***, f***. I don't believe anybody anymore. Is it Metroid? F*** Retro. Oh, now in development. Whatever. It's got to be Retro. They just, you lied to me, Mr. Nintendo. I love you so goddamn much for it. Yoshi.

You fought your way this far. There's nothing you two can't do. No matter the danger, we can overcome it if we're working together. All right, let's move out. Working together, we can finish this. Now kiss. Oh no, we need to re-evaluate you. F***. Okay, well, hi there. I'm The Legend of Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma.

If video gaming is a journey, then anywhere has to include a stop right here in LA during E3. This is Magic Week. Magic where booths buzz and channels glow, where the game worlds you've heard about suddenly spring into life. And this summer, a new kind of heated competition ignites right on Nintendo Switch. It kicks off later today with the Splatoon 2 World Inkling Invitational, which brings teams from the Americas, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan to see whose colorful skills are the best.
