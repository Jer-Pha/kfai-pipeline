We're going to do a fun Watch-A-Long of Attack on Titan today. We're doing Season 2, Episode 3. You can watch along with us by going to VRV.co/KindaFunny. That's VRV.co/KindaFunny. You can get your free 7-day trial of the VRV Combo Pack, which will allow you to watch along with us to Attack on Titan. You can watch it on Funimation dubbed like we're about to do, or on Crunchyroll subbed like I know a lot do you want to do. Now the thing is, the subbed version has a longer our own intro and then the dubbed version, so the timing's going to be kind of messed up. What we're going to do to rectify that though, is we're going to just start watching the cold open right now. Those of you that don't know what a cold open is, it's the part before the theme song. We're gonna watch that. We're gonna watch through the theme song.",

Alright, if one of the chat, does that make sense? Well, jokes. People in this room is a little off. It seems to be having connectivity issues. Should probably stop uploading. Yeah, God. Okay, that X is it, guys. We're, hold on then. We're gonna look at this thing. Hold on one sec. We're gonna redo that whole thing in the jam. Yeah, yeah, that's uh, can you walk around and make sure if no one's streaming and no one's uploading anything right now? Thank you. Yeah, well, Morning Show will have to be posted afterwards. That's fine. Yeah, we should also jet minutes. Fine. Well, no, 'cause we're watching multiple episodes. Well, that's fine. Oh, Sean, what? I'm so did it. One, one. Sorry, guys, those missions.",

This was a test for me to see how things are gonna go when we're doing um, Games. G. Gillis L. says, 'Will there be Watch-A-Longs of every episode?' We'll probably do more Watch-A-Longs of this because Tim and I are addicted to us. I don't see why not. You're actually is kind of playing it by ear right now. Yeah, I have a feeling that we will. I think so. I mean, obviously, this is this is sponsored by VRV, obviously, but we do love the Attack on Titan, so we'll watch more these episodes as soon as possible. The promise will run in three weeks, so you have to buckle down like now. We do figure it out. And also, Attack on Titan's a little hard.

So what we're going to do is we're going to start playing it first and we're start the time right as we come out of the intro songs. Everyone knows when the actual episode starts. Get out the cold open or watch that first intro and then boom, timer starts. You guys can watch with us as we get into the actual episodes. You have to remember to do that.
