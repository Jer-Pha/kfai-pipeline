Does this mean we are now not supposed to buy it if we want to support the Screen Actor's Guild? Um, well in this particular case, Ashley Burch who voiced Chloe in Life is Strange is actually working with Deck 9 on Before the Storm so in a writing capacity, correct. So not buying the game would then not be supporting the woman who you are trying to support by not buying the game. This a paradox, so maybe so.
