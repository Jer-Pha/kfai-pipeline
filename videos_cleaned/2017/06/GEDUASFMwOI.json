It's very exciting and it is brought to you by Patreon producer Tom Bach, the homie. Shout out to Tom Bach. You've been super cool. Yeah, Tom's such a nice dude. He emails me. He knows his Kinda Funny Live is coming up. He emails me just like, dude, like, I know you're you're going through hell. Like, you got this. Whatever. I appreciate that, man. Just a little like positive reinforcement. BTW, welcome back to the show, Tim. You weren't here last. I was here. Yeah, for a while. Feels like week before.

Planning the things that are coming out after Kinda Funny Live to the people like E3, for instance. We got got to predict. And also, thank you to the Patreon supporters here. You can see your names. Thank you. A lot of Patreon talk because we have the Patreon family. Hey, what's up? I work on Patreon. Do you work on Patreon? I do work on Patreon. On Pat, we like the Justice League of Patreon.

Yeah, how you guys doing? Good. I mean, I think we're all like a little frazzled and pre-E3. Obviously, you guys have, you know, Kinda Funny Live 3 also to worry about. Who picked that date? Yeah, Tim, who picked that date? I think it's a great date. E3 is **** easy. I love. So, I mean, this is a fun time capsule 'cause it's recording before Kinda Funny Live 3, posting the Friday before Kinda Funny Live 3 for Patreon supporters and then YouTube regularly. But yeah, it was last night. Jen was like, oh yeah. I'm like, did you guys pick June 3rd because of Kinda Funny Live 3?

Yeah, a lot of like, you know what, June works. And like, what we do, like our E3 planning is like Greg has to do a lot of say. Says the guy who doesn't have to do it. Yeah, yeah, but I mean, like planning the live streams and planning the important **** for E3 is easy as hell, right? We just show up and **** do stuff.

Oh, it's so hard. It's so hard. You have the opposite problem. Yeah, we've all struggled. Have the opposite problem, man. All right, let's get right into it. Well, before, lay out the rules for the E3 predictions. Okay, 'cause I don't want your ****. Yeah, there's rules. Yeah, Danny, the rules are simple. You know, to in protect our integrity is the fact that somebody hit me up about this like, hey, wait, how can you do predictions if you went to Judges Week? You know everything. As always, the rules are, we only predict things we don't know. If we know, you don't you don't say anything. You don't mention it. You're not going to lose as a prediction.

Yeah, obviously now more Jeremy Dunham, I think not. Jeremy Dunham, people have a warped perception of what Judges Week is. Sure. Judges Week is not you go there and they give you all the the stuff that they're talking about press conferences. It's the the games that aren't necessarily going to be on the the stage. No first-party stuff generally, right? Correct. Yeah, this year I didn't. Yeah, there was no PlayStation, no Microsoft, no Nintendo. I didn't see any of them seeing other publishers, other developers who are there who understand that their stuff probably will get overshadowed. It wouldn't get as much linear. Well, yeah, and in previous judges years past, like even if first-party brings things, it's not like top secret things that aren't announced. You know, it's it's stuff that's been announced. It'd be like if Activision had Call of Duty Hands-On.",

It'd be like if Activision had Call of Duty Hands-On playable at Judges Week. We all know Call of Duty is coming. They've already announced it. So it's not like shocking. T like that. Judges Week is more about playing games than announcements. Am I correct? Yeah, so if you're playing it, it's far enough along that it's probably been announced. It's like a logistical thing to like make sure people have time to. I mean, apart from the awards element of it, but that's sort of become, you know, a bit confused now. But it's a way to digest it and make sure you have the content and you can talk about ahead of time and those embargos, right? Like Far Cry 5 is a great example that where I saw Far Cry 5 down there weeks before it was announced. Then when it was announced, we're all able to talk about it and be able to give it its moment in the spotlight before big old Jack.",

So what we're going to do is we're going to go around the table. Uh, we each have five predictions. Topic one is PlayStation. Topic two is Nintendo. Topic three is Xbox. And topic four are the third-party uh groups that are having having press conferences. Not Capcom in them, but we're talking you Doda yet to be clear. As always, I'm sure M. Dog is out there ready to tabulate the votes. Here it is done down to the decimal. There are half points and little points awarded. So the more detailed your your prediction, the better chance you have at least getting a tenth of a point. And I always add the Timmy's Hyped Moment brought to you by Gatorade. Um, but that that's just me for the record. Never ever been brought. Gatorade's never paid you for this. Oh, no, no, no. One day they will.",

Prediction one. Now, for the record, you better not pick. I've made not I've made eight here. Yeah, got that way. I have. I can feel it in my shorts. I can jump around. Exactly. Exactly. I bet you don't for Microsoft. Yeah, they are. I got a couple good ones for them actually. The one I'll begin with is this. PlayStation VR lives. The conference reveals no less than five PlayStation VR games. No less five. Okay, that's actually a really good one. I I I believe new games, unannounced games. Yeah, five.

You understand how this works. Saying I am counting in this. If Battlefield or Battlefront II is like, and we have PlayStation VR mode. Are you reading all five of your predictions? I was going to say that's not the way. Since I have the bonus, I'm throwing out then at I'm putting it's no longer a full prediction. It's a star. And this isn't even a prediction. This is an example. Now that will no longer be used as a prediction, M. Dog. It's an example.

No, you don't think so? You want original games? What do you want? It's your prediction. It reveals no less than five PlayStation VR games. I think that you can if you're porting something over, it's still a game. As always, yeah, if the PC people are over there, they're beta testing it for us and then they bring it to console when there's. I'm with you, Danny. I think it's I think it's a little I think it's a little sticky, but hey, it's a lot. I know it is. It's a lot less exciting if it's just if history says anything, you've been wrong about your PSVR predictions every single time.

I my thing with VR is I was thinking that Dreams would be the the big VR thing that they that they push at all. And I do think that in addition to Battlefront, there would be some type of like 'cause last year they showed the Arkham and um Final Fantasy and like all those things. There'll be a big game like that. Like some something that's just like a big experience based on a AAA game. But you're crazy though. And like that stuff was to I don't know, bolster the sort of like, we've got X amount of games for PlayStation VR's launch, right?

Throwing them speak that Final Fantasy XV VR thing. Do you guys know did that ever come out? I don't think it did. I don't think it's pretty sure. I think everyone was like, this is hot garbage. And Square was like, okay. Yeah, let me know later if there's a plan for that. Danny, all right, your first prediction. All right. Horizon Zero Dawn DLC. Damn it, that was mine. Damn, getting in there. I didn't even think about that. They have been. How could you not think about that? I know 'cause it's like, I'm thinking too big picture with Sony, man.

You know, that game was so much fun. I've gone back multiple times and done like side quests and stuff that I missed out. I wish the New Game Plus thing was a little bit better fleshed out. It's kind of like it's not as bad as Zelda, but it's a bit like, oh, we just load you to last save and do what you want. Um, so I'm hoping that maybe, you know, more interesting backstory into Aloy and stuff like that comes into it. Yeah, it won't be though, right? Like, I think I think I feel like when they do it, it'll be like, we told her story. So now it is found a new encampment. There's this new pro a new villain. Not Van Villain. Rost. Oh, yeah.

No one wants to take care of VR. 1-2-Switch wanted to. 1-2-Switch wanted. They want they did many things. All right, right. Is that the end of your prediction? Yeah, pretty much.

It might not necessarily be number two, but it'll be a followup to Bloodborne. Okay, fair. Will it have the name Bloodborne? Yes. Bloodborne something. Okay, yes, because that was a very definitive exclusive u in the brand new PS4 when it first came out. Like, it was a fantastic exclusive for them to kind of lead their new generation with.

There there was that red a thread a while back of a game called, was it, Phantom Wail or something, which was the, you know, the team FromSoftware doing a Bloodborne sequel, but maybe not Bloodborne exactly. But it's like, you know, more hand-to-hand combat. I think it was like Chinese or something, sort of Dynasty era thing. Again, could be total nonsense. Yeah, but would they deviate from Bloodborne right away? Probably not, right? I don't think so. If it's on PlayStation, if it's on a different system, I think that they would obviously. But yeah, exclusive. Yes. Okay, yeah. Okay, good cheat. Okay, my first one. Thanks. We will get an update on Shenmue III.

There's been too many trademark leaks of this HD Collection. I don't think Shenmue III has much to be said about it, but I do think that it's worth talking about just to get to the collection. Do you? No, I think it's just way too much work to redo those games for such a small audience that would buy them. Sure. Yeah, has been doing it though. We recently we got the Bayonetta and Vanquish PC ports. Like, I I'm not think it it's impossible. I feel like that upscale is probably easier than.

I'm I'm saying this year just as like because of all the trademark stuff that's been going on because this been this this whole year since last E3, there's been a whole bunch of the Shenmue News on the morning shows come up a bazillion times. So Shenmue News, new segment. Shenmue News, New Morning Show. All right, all right, what you got? It's one that again is one that gets predicted quite a bit here. Sucker Punch's game is revealed.

Yeah, I I feel like the Infamous it petered out a bit. Second Son. Like, I like Second Son, but like, you're right. I think it's time for them to do something exciting. And it was the fact that it was two E3s ago that we had Shuhei Yoshida on the E3 Live Show and he was he was holding over Colin's head that he'd already played whatever Sucker Punch's next working prototype was.

We're going to have. Yeah, they're just going to play. Show gameplay. No way. Especially with Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. I don't think that they they're going focus on that. It's not what.
