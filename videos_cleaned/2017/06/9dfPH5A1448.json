We decided to to go out to this fancy French restaurant. I was about to say rest in peace. Yeah, called Janier. Janier, I'm not sure. Starts J and ends with some Franklin and like Fank. Yeah, it's around there. It's on um Bush Grove Grove Street. So it was there and we walked by recently and she was just like, oh, like we should go there. It's really nice. My cool booked that reservation that night. I was like, I know what's up with this ****. We go there. It's just me, her, her sister, and her sister's boyfriend. And we walk in and immediately I'm like, didn't even think about how fancy this place was. Inspired by the Opera, by the way. Exactly. I was wearing a button-up shirt, so I lucked out there, but totally could have been wearing exactly this outfit and the fine. But we realized it's San Francisco. There's nowhere in San Francisco that you have to dress up. You wear fancy shorts.",

I'm like, no, best thing about San Francisco is you can see a person be like, they either own Facebook or they're a college student. No idea. Absolutely no one **** knows. No one **** cares. But I go in and I was a little early and uh the bartender hands me the menu to look at and I very quickly realize I'm going to need some help. I'm going to need some Googling and I hope that when people come here, my like my group that they are a little more well versed in this stuff because I don't know what 90% of the words in this menu are. Escargot was like a French SL. It was French, but then even a lot of the words, they're just fancy food words. And so I guess my topic",

Um, cuz but I have my wife and so she's always the one that takes me to the fancy restaurants. Uh whenever we have friends in town or whatever, she'll make the reservation for that. And then I I'm just unabashed about it. I'm like, I don't know what this is. Like, I don't whatever, who cares? But part of most of the restaurants, if you go to a good restaurant, they enjoy teaching you about the menu and what that is. Um, but also then they just use words that you don't know anyway potentially. But my wife does. So that's what. So if you ever want to borrow Dee for a night, you can uh you can phone a friend.

But but I feel like I want images on everything. Exactly. And the fancy places, they don't **** with the the pictures. Don't they don't they don't. It's an issue because then you Google it and like like trying to figure out what type of pasta is what. Yeah, right. That's hard. You Google that and it's just like, what is this? So last night there was I'm Italian. I don't even know what half the pastas. Frittata. Do you guys know what frittata? Like a radicchio. It is the second evolution of it. Yes. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Nikki, she loves um she's an interior designer. So she's like very like her she's way more fancy than I will ever be. So every time we go out to eat like with friends, it's always just some **** place in Austin that I've never heard of.

And it's like, no, you can't get it. We don't have Coke. Hey, we actually natural cane soda last night. I was looking. I got excited because on the dessert menu, there was an ice cream sandwich. And I'm like, whoa, I'll take a fancy ice cream sandwich. I'm looking at it. It was $11. And like on one hand, I'm like, **** that $11 for an ice cream sandwich.

You figure a lot of it wasn't French though. That's they these were English words. These were or I don't know what **** words they were, but they weren't French. I think Janier is the only French thing about it. But then so the the real thing that upset me here is this confit. Confit. I get it. I don't **** with it. I'm sorry. I'm scared of what's different. I admit it. Do you know what this confit is? God, so good. You're not going to like it. Oh man, you're not going like, yeah, what is it, Nick? Please. The it's a duck b basically, right?

Click on foie gras right there. Right. People also four over over to the right. You're going the opposite down there it is which is just p\u00e2t\u00e9. So foie gras. It's you you shove food into the the duck till it can't like you like L and literally push food into its mouth so it suffocates. So click on the Wikipedia. No, you keep them and you don't let them move around and you just becomes very very fat. Yeah, it makes the liver really fat. S it sounds like almost by French law, foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck, goose fattened by force feeding corn with a feeding tube, a process known as Gavage in Spain.

I it but to be fair, wait, was it foie gras or I don't know, but I thought it was the thing that I thought was the torture torture to throw up. Yeah, okay. Like look like that. It did look like that.

Gia and them got trout like a fancy trout. And I'm like, that seems weird. Was it seems well, there was only four options for entr\u00e9e. There was chicken, steak, trout, and um duck. Oh ****. Should have come duck. And and all of them weren't explained those ways except for the trout. They kept trout in the name. You can't say trout without trout.

And like they're talking about like their one of their goals is to become somebody that get decide the Michelin star thing. Oh wow. Yeah. And like they're working towards that. Whatever. That's cool.

Good for them. You know where in this city can I get a shrimp Linguine plate? Here's my problem with this city. Pasta Pomodoro, which is where you would think that San Francisco, of course, known for North Beach, uh has good Italian food. I have yet to have stellar Italian food in the city. And it breaks my heart because a lot of times people will come in and ask for that. My brother loves Italian food. He's like, let's get Italian food. I'm like, I don't have an option for you. But I'm sorry cuz there's no like if you go to North Beach, more often than not, all those places are tourist traps. They're quasi okay. You're going to get **** service. Um you're going to get okay food. You're not going to get like you're just not getting what I feel is an either an authentic Italian or a San Francisco spin Italian. There's a place called Borgia.",

Well, usually there's a lot of clam, lemon, garlic. You get a lot of you get a lot of clam like uh Linguine con vongole, which is like that that say it again. Vongole sounds good. Uh but you get that with like, you know, you get the white clam sauce or red clam sauce, things like that.
