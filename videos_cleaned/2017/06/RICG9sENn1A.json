Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was prescription medication or something. He blew a 0.0 on the ****. I think he was asleep. I think they found I think the police found him asleep, you know, in his car. Yeah, but no, I don't think there is a way unfortunately. I think it's just human nature whether that's I mean it's shitty but I'm I mean I won't lie I'm I'm the same way like I I don't know if I'll go to that extreme where it's like somebody's having a problem I'm sure people will pop up with receipts of me talking **** but uh no I don't think there is a way to put the genie back in the",

That's the problem with guys that get this big like Tiger Woods is one of the biggest sport stars on the planet still even though he's not even if he's not winning Master championships still like he's a multi multimillionaire everyone knows the name Tiger Woods he's synonymous he's ubiquitous at this point with golf so I think that a lot of people don't realize that when you when you see that image that's a real human being that had to stand in front of a mug shot and probably had the one of the worst days of his year so far if not of his life that night so you know it's not I don't know I mean the same could be said for",

And there was a thread there that immediately was not immediately I shouldn't say there was a thread that started talking about PS I Love You talking about Colin talking about him leaving and then one that was like it's got It's got to **** stick in Greg's craw that Colin's doing so successful, you know what I mean?
