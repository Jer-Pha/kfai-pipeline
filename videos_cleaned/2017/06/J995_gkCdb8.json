Say some sweet nasty love, Big G, out there. Little G, Big G, happy birthday. Uh, I was talking about the fact that that uh, Special Delivery Paperboy's out, VR Paperboy game for PlayStation. The VR, the VR heads. What's it called? Special Delivery. Special Delivery. Yeah, yeah. Okay, fairly confident in that. You know what I mean? 'Cause there was a trophy that I got confused with when I was doing, when I was doing the final Rooster's Report. I mentioned it doing the final Rooster's Report, but I'm pretty sure I'm nailing it right now. How does it work? Is it Move controllers? I, well, I mean, you know, you know PlayStation isn't promoting the VR games as well, so I don't have 100% of his. What I do imagine is yes, that it's this and then it's controllers, but then again, they're a small team, so maybe not. But then again, it's the whole point of it.",

I mean, there's, there's monsters, there's things to worry out for. That sounds crazy. There's, I mean, there's monsters on Tuesdays in in Paperboy. Exactly. I mean, there's things happening here. I'm going to get you a trailer. I'll get you a Special Delivery VR trailer. All right, all right. Let's, you want to get that in the, I'm getting in the dock. Cool.

You texted me last night, you're like, I'm like, I, I don't feel like, I feel like I got this done. Yeah, that's the difference between you and me, Greg. You just do things.

I, I think Friday the 13th has pulled back the veil and I'm finally ready to admit that maybe there was a conspiracy there to keep review scores down.

No, the third version is the definitive edition that comes out usually a year and a half to two years later, and they'll add a whole bunch of really cool stuff.
