Life is Strange: Before the Storm. What up, Chloe, Kandy, Andy himself, Cortez. I'm here too. What do I mean? Okay, let's let's let's start with the the big big news. Xbox One X. Yeah, $499 US, November 7th. Mmm. All games will be better on it eventually. Sure. Yeah. Is what what they're going forward? All the games going backwards? A couple of the big ones? Sure. What are the gut reactions? Oh, ouch. Did Point did not stick the landing on that? I mean, I think in over overall, um, you talked about it during the conference. This conference was solid. It was not a home run. I don't think. Like somebody made a joke in here, PlayStation, just as long as they show up tomorrow, they beat him. I don't think it's that drastic or anything, but I think this was a conference of like, hey, we have 40 games to show you today. And hey, a lot of them are going to seem A to",

But at no point in that conference was I convinced of why, and this what I talked about before, I was not told why I, Greg Miller, need to buy an Xbox One X. Yep. You know what I mean? This conference had a message that was very loud and clear to me, which is the Xbox One X is very equivalent to the PlayStation 4 Pro in terms of where it stands in their lineup. It is not the next system. There was a lot of back and forth. Like I remember we used to talk to Colin a lot about where does this stand. And for a long time, I predicted that Xbox was lying about the whole all games are going to be um playable on both the OG Xbox One and the new one. I thought it was going to be a successor",

A couple months ago, when they first started talking a bit more, I was like, and after the PS4 Pro launched, I realized where everything stood. And here we are. I this is $500 is way too much. But I also don't think that it's going to affect him too much because it is just another Xbox One. Xbox One S is going to be just fine to play all of these games. There wasn't any single thing here that made us be like, you know what, we need an Xbox One X for that. Don't necessarily think that's an issue. Agreed. I think the price point is such a bummer. Like, oh my God. I so with the PS4 Pro's what, at $400 right now? I think that needs to be the price point. Like you need to show, you need to show the fans, hey, we're giving you way more power than the Pro has at the same price. There's",

He's a good employee. Thank you, Cool Greg. I'd blow you a kiss, but I'd be afraid you'd beat me to death. Also, the Xbox One S, the $200 price point, that's for a week. Yeah, just for a week. That sucks. Like if it was $200 permanently, sure. I was telling Greg this in the pre-show that gave me hope that the Xbox One X was going to be like a $400 console to have a $200 and a $400 console. But the fact that it's going to be probably $250-$300 for a week and then $250 back after that, that's a bummer, man. Yeah, but I mean, man, there is a lot of games coming.

We've talked about it before and I know we bring this up time when we had Adam Boyes on at E3 or after a PSX where he was like, well, when we were disappointed, I think in a PSX a couple years ago, he's like, well, you build these shows so that everybody can come in and say, oh, well, I like these three games, these three announcements. When you come out and say you have 40 announcements and you're launching a new SKU, people should leave like, there's no reason I know exactly why I'm buying that and here are the seven games I'm super fucking stoked about. Right? I don't come away from conference with the seven games I'm super stoked about. Really?

I'm glad that's finally happening. But again, they said the same thing with DayZ and H1Z1. So they put the dates on this one. Well, at least see how dates stick. Yeah. Um, The Last Night looks freaking incredible. The Last Night looks great too. But again, like that's not, I mean, yeah, that's one of the games I put on my list, right?

And correct me if I'm wrong, anybody out there. And here I'm looking, Annapurna is over here talking Artful Escape. Right? I saw an email come in from them. Yeah. Okay, hold on. The little boy with the guitar. Uh, yeah, that's right. Uh, they linked me to this thing because why just give me the information, you know? Yeah, 100%. Here, The Artful Escape. Go here. The Artful Escape release date TBD, TBD. The way I read it, and correct me I'm wrong, Chad, is that there was a difference between Xbox. Okay, the people are saying I'm right. Cool. Just making sure.

We just got the PR release in email from Microsoft. Says Crackdown 3, Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive. Yeah. Whereas The Last Night says console launch exclusive. Yeah, but does that what about Steam? Well, they don't care about that. Why was was Windows 10? Right? Well, that'll be on there, whatever. Windows 10 App Store, whatever. Yeah, they're not competing with shit. Steam and Windows. They're not working going through it. The Last Night that looks freaking incredible. Seen that. Andy and Nick have appointment booked for it.

Um, a lot of the ID@Xbox stuff we saw too quickly to care. And honestly, a lot of it looked kind of throw away. Sure. Well, Tacoma, August 2nd. I'm excited for that. Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Fuck yeah. Get another Ori. Loved the first one and I definitely wanted more. Didn't necessarily expect we were going to get it. So that's great for me. But honestly, Anthem at the end, I went from zero fucks to all the fucks. That looked amazing. Sure. But my question is, is it one of those multiplayer only things or is there single player? Cuz I don't want to do the multiplayer. I'm sure it'll be a little bit like The Division where you can do a lot of the missions on your own.

Yeah. And then they met up with the other, you know, players at the end or whatever. Here's what I want to say about Anthem. That demo looked fantastic. I like the idea. I like mech suits or I like Iron Man-y suits like that. I want to go through and do that. And I hate to be this guy, cuz don't get me wrong, Mass Effect: Andromeda does not take away from everything BioWare has ever done. I'm not trying to say that or anything, right?

Is he going to be one of those guys who's up there in the real game like this and like, and I know, you know, there's this awesome article up from Schreier this week, right? Or was it Kotaku? Or not? Uh, Jason. It was Jason Schreier over at Kotaku put up the thing about here's why Andromeda got so off the rails. I understand that.

That game will get pushed way out. What will the final product look like? That's all I want. I just want to temper expectations. I don't know if it'll get pushed out that far cuz like, do we know how long they've been working on it? I feel like they've been working on it as soon as Mass Effect 3 wrapped and the main team went on to work there. Well, that was the whole thing. Yeah, Casey Hudson brought a team over there and then Casey Hudson left the team. Yeah. So what did that? I mean, like, and I'm not saying that's people leave all the time, different things.

And I loved the fact that they went from air to land to sea underneath and all three looked super awesome. The mech suit made it look fun to maneuver. That I'm just saying, temper expectations. That was an amazing demo. We've seen that before. The first Watch Dogs trailer also looked really. We've seen a lot of we see a lot of E3 demos that you eventually get in our fun, great games that just don't look or feel like that. Yeah, hopefully it isn't scaled down a huge amount. Like just like Watch Dogs. I remember that. So here's my big question then. Is anybody here going to buy Xbox One X as of now? Absolutely not. Yeah. Yeah. What about it? Do you have an Xbox One?

Like when they presented it as a media player years ago or whatever it was, that's what it became to me. It it became a Netflix box, a Hulu box. And I played a fuckload of Destiny on it. Um, yeah, I played the shit out of my Xbox. Like I didn't get a PS4 until a little bit later until uh Uncharted 4 dropped. Okay. Okay. Um, yeah, I'm probably going to get one pretty soon.

It didn't drive home why this is a standout. Everybody in the chat who was like, oh, me, me, me, I'm sick of zombie games. I'm like, I feel you. And like I in the in the 4 seconds right before we had done where some kid was like, what? I don't know about State of Decay. What is it? I did a bad job of explaining why it's great. Right?

And then there was no demo to follow it up. And it also didn't look great. Yeah, it looked like State of Decay. It looked like State of Decay, which is surprising in to an extent to me because I did feel in my head, I'm thinking Microsoft's got nothing up their sleeves.
