That's me. That's you. How are you, Andrea? I'm actually still real tired from... I was going to say, are you hanging in there after E3 2017? Yeah, so my voice is still on its way back, so I'm sorry if I'm a little croaky today. Um, but it was a very long, very exciting, eventful week. Did you have a good one? Did you enjoy E3 2017? Yeah, it was, it was so crazy 'cause I was in so many different places uh throughout the week, but it was um, it was really fun. I didn't get to see and play as many games as I would have liked, um, but I got to talk to a lot of great people and uh, you know, a lot of people came up to the Facebook booth and said hello, which was really nice. Well, that's always the downside of what, and this is woe as me, tiniest violin, the downside of what we do is the fact that when I, when we did GameSpot is Kinda Funny, the",

Like, you only see what comes to you. And so it was this year, you know, we did the afternoon of GameSpot, even though we got in a day late, and then we're able to run around and see different things. But even then, it was like over on the forums, kids were asking me like, have, did, is there an update on Cuphead? I'm like, I did not get to see Cuphead. We got a release date. I'm ready for Cuphead. I'm glad there's finally a release date. But no, we didn't, we didn't bust over there to see that one, do that, right? Exactly. Uh, thank you for joining me. This is the first, first ever episode of Kinda Funny Games Daily. I'm so pumped. I know, me too. I'm very, we've been talking about doing something for a really long time, so I'm glad",

Uh, ladies and gentlemen, if you for some reason don't know, here's what Kinda Funny Games Daily is. It is the DNA of Podcast Beyond, of PS I Love You XOXO. It is a daily show about video game news, going through it, talking it out, seeing what's happening, giving some context to it, then answering questions, having fun bits, doing all different kinds of segments and stuff like that. Uh, there are a whole bunch of things in process right now as we move. I got a text message. I want to see if this is from James. No, this is Jen Uber. That didn't help me at all. Uh, basically, if you go to my Twitter right now, there is a link up to go ask questions for this.

However, I do need your help live because here's the thing, we're doing the show and it's confusing as hell. I know. We're doing the show live on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames, but you're doing, you're getting to watch us record it. There's no, there's no subs, there's none of this stuff. There's no chat for us to look at. That's not what this show is. This show is, hey, let's have the discussion we're going to have and keep it going.

However, if you are watching live, the way we have you interact is simple, over on KindaFunny.com forums, there is Kinda Funny Games Daily You're Wrong. Uh, I want you guys to be the stat boy for this show, like PTI. Basically, when we start talking, we're going to screw something up. We're going to say somebody did something when they didn't, or not. Certainly, you go in there, you post it. I need the facts. Get right to the point of the facts.

We're going to figure out as we go. That's the whole point of Kinda Funny, doing it on the fly, figuring it all out. You know what I mean? By the seat of our pants or our dress, whichever it may be. Let's jump in with what is and forever will be the Roper Report. Time for some news. That is, I asked Kevin for one contribution to this show, and that was it, and he just knocked it out of the park. Good job, Kev. Good job, Kev. Uh, so the idea of the Roper Report here on Kinda Funny Games Daily isn't, hey, here's everything you missed. Here's the biggest stuff that you might have missed.

Generally, not a lot of news the Monday after. There's so much news from E3 that then, and then, but then there's nothing happening in the current space, so we just have to go. But there's a lot of things to update you on. I thought the one that was the most interesting, Andrea Rene, was this whole no cross-play for PlayStation. It was a very hot topic last year, or last week, excuse me. Well, it's been, that's the thing, is it's been going since last year, right? Last year, they talked about this. Sony said, quote, we would be happy to have the conversation with any publishers or developers who are interested in cross-platform play, right? 'Cause it kind of kicked off with Rocket League when they announced, you know, cross-platform play, and then, you know, Phil Spencer talked about how Xbox and PC are capable uh of doing cross-play with PlayStation, but it's PlayStation",

And there had been this thing. So Sony gives this, you know, lip service response last year. Then this year, after having the cross-play with the PC version of Rocket League, this year Minecraft comes out, and Xbox, at the Xbox conference, and Xbox is like, this is now you play it across all the Switch, the 360, the, the mobile, the Xbox One, the Xbox One X, all, all these different things. People like, oh, PlayStation. They're like, no, not PlayStation. PlayStation said no. And every like, oh, then Rocket League comes out with their Switch thing, and they're like, play across all platforms, play everybody. And people like, PlayStation. And they're like, no, just this Switch, PC, Mobile, Xbox thing, right? Every goes, what the hell does that mean? That doesn't make any sense. Why",

Quote, we have a contract with the people who go online with us that we look after them, and they are within the PlayStation curated Universe, exposing what in many cases are children to external influences we have no ability to manage or look after. It's something we have to think about very carefully. This is a face palm kind of moment, right? Like, I mean, I'm sure the PR people off stage when he was doing that interview were like, why did you say that? I mean, and you know, Phil Spencer gave a response. He told Polygon, the fact that somebody would kind of make an assertation that somehow we're not keeping Minecraft players safe, I found not only from a Minecraft, or excuse me, a Microsoft perspective, but from a game industry perspective,",

I found not only from a Minecraft, or excuse me, a Microsoft perspective, but from a game industry perspective, like, I don't know why that has to become the dialogue. That doesn't seem healthy for anyone. He's absolutely right. There was no reason why Jim Ryan should have said what he said about them not keeping their community safe. I mean, Nintendo of all people, Nintendo keeping children safe in their communities for much longer than anybody else has. It's a completely tone deaf, bonehead response that I can't understand how PlayStation didn't have an answer for. Even if you don't know, well, you must have known, 'cause I'm sure Rocket League and Minecraft at some point ask you. Someone on in the PlayStation team understands that this is going to happen at some point. We need a response, we need an answer. And again, them being a privately held business, or whatever, being a business, I should say, it doesn't, okay, I think",

We don't need to get into the Xbox. We don't need to get in the Switch. Instead, to grasp at straws and blame kids, it's like, what, what? Yeah, it's a frustrating uh topic, I think, not only for the executives who are having to deal with the, the fallout from the response, but also for the community. I, I think we all would appreciate just a little bit of transparency from PlayStation. If they would just come forward and say, hey, for business reasons, we, there will not be cross-play with Xbox One. You know, like, I just want them to like, like, put the nail in the coffin and like, let it be done, 'cause I don't think it's ever going to happen, and they're kind of leaving the door open in",

But like, they don't have to do cross-play. I mean, they have probably, you know, double the install base of the Xbox One at this point. And if they just came forward and say, hey, like, for business reasons, we just are not going to do cross-play, and just like, put it to bed, I think that would be the best call. But I don't know why they're continuing. You, it gets more interesting, right? Because I'd seen all that when E3, but it's coming from every direction. GameSpot had this one up there, right? However, to play Switch, you have to make an Xbox Live account. Quote, it's an Xbox Live account. That's our gaming social network.

Controls, controls around parental controls and other things that we put in the platforms are there. And as you're buying things in Minecraft, you want to make sure you have them available on all the other platforms. So we have to know who you are. If you have, if you have a realm that you've created on the PC and want to get into on the Switch, you have an identity system, and we just use Xbox Live. Right there, that makes so much more sense. And I, if I was Jim Ryan, I would have been like, uh, you know, we thought about it, but the fact that you need to make our competitor's online account through what would have been the PlayStation interface, right?

Yeah, I, I mean, that he was kind of put into a corner. He had to kind of say something like that. And I'm sure that they're frustrated that they're going for this message of unification across all of the Minecraft platforms.

It looks so good for them and so bad for PlayStation. I understand why they'll keep bringing it up and keep talking about it. Course, of course. But I think PlayStation is in the position of like, Coca-Cola looking at Pepsi, going like, why do we need to play nice together? Like, I don't even need to that you exist. Exactly, exactly. Don't acknowledge they exist. I was trying to think of who the analog to us was in, in, in a way to, it'd be like us acknowledging IGN. We don't need him, you know what I mean?

Uh, the next story I want to bring up is another one that popped after E3, so it kind of got buried in everything. IO Interactive is independent, and they have Hitman. Uh, of course, ladies, gentlemen, back in May, Square Enix dropped IO Interactive. Quote, to maximize player satisfaction as well as market potential going forward, we are focusing our resources and energies on key franchises and studios. Square Enix said in its statement, as a result, the company has regrettably decided to withdraw from the business of IO Interactive, a wholly owned subsidiary of a Danish corporation, as of March 31st, 2017. This happened. Total confusion then as to what that meant. Who had, does Square have the Hitman franchise? Did they, does IO have",

And then it was Quiet on the Western Front to figure out what was going on, right? Then, uh, over the weekend, they, the studio CEO posted a giant letter that was very nice and said, therefore, I am proud to announce today that IO Interactive is now officially an independent studio. We have successfully concluded, not colluded, collusion, concluded our negotiations with Square Enix and have agreed to a management buyout. Crucially, we will keep all the rights to the Hitman IP. This is a watershed moment for IO Interactive. As of today, we have complete control over the direction for our studio and the Hitman IP. We're about to forge our own",

We are now open opportunities with future collaborators and partners to help strengthen us as a studio and ensure that we can produce the best games possible for our community. So, a happy ending there. Yeah, I think it's great. I'm a little confused as to why they didn't work out all these details before they announced that Square was getting rid of IO. I think it would have made a much better um, you know, message if they had worked out the details of IO retaining the IP of Hitman and then said, hey, you know, they're going to go their own way, they're taking Hitman with them. Because I remember when this news came out, it was so shocking because Hitman was such a well done game this last time around. You know, the season pass came out, they released all the",

Um, and so I think it left a lot of us kind of like scratching our heads going like, why did Square Enix decide to do this? And for me, it was, I thought that was the canary in the coal mine that this came together quick. Something happened here. I don't know where is coming down. I mean, Square is Japan, so something from the Japanese side is coming down of like, kill this, do that. We're making all these changes to make sure our profits look better on a spreadsheet or whatever. But it sounded, yeah, like, well, why wouldn't you, why, why wouldn't there be again answers as soon as this happens? You know, the first thing people are going to ask is, where's Hitman?

Well, I think the frustrating part is when you think about the giant global structure of a conglomerate like Square Enix, the people who are making those financial decisions aren't thinking about the gamer. They're not thinking about the studio members probably. They're thinking about like you said, a number on a spreadsheet. What's going to look best for our, our shareholders, right? That's going to look best on our balance sheet.

Uncharted, by the time when Uncharted One hits, not as many people have PS3s, so they're like, okay, whatever. The people who get it, get it and like it. But then when Uncharted finally came around, enough people had bought PS3s that they were like, oh, I've heard of Uncharted. I know that that was interesting.

I, I, I kind of agree with, with you. Um, I think that it is going to give them the freedom, the not only from a creative standpoint, from a marketing standpoint, to decide how they want to spend their dollars. If they would rather spend more on production, adding more features to the game, or spend more on, on buying ad space.

That's a ton of people. And so what I want to know is, what was your experience? This is one of the, I, we put out the questions, you know, like, what are people uh wanting us to talk about? You know, it's Daily News show. What is the big story for Monday? And the one was, how is E3 for you guys, especially with all these people there? Um, it definitely was crowded, and it was crowded in a really frustrating way. If you think about a show like PAX East, they had an estimated attendance of 75,000 attendees this year. So more people than what E3 had. But ReedPop, the company that runs the PAX conventions, is prepared for that amount of people. They have what's a room called a queue hall?",

On Tuesday, there was a line around the block of the convention center because there was just no place to put all of these people who were queuing up to get inside. They also had like three different doors that you could go in. At PAX, there's like one central door, everybody has to go through metal detectors, there's security. There was none of that at the convention center, at least that I saw. I never had to go through a metal detector, one just go through, show my badge to that one person with the little pen light who doesn't want to be there.

And you know, some of the games that would have been really easy for people like us to like walk up to and get hands-on within a few minutes were hours wait. And it was like having a media badge didn't give you the kind of access that it has previously. I've always said that E3 is an appointment-based show. No matter how level, how high you are up on the media food chain, you still have to make appointments to see the bulk of everything at E3. Um, but this year was particularly challenging. Sure.

And normally, if you remember years past, Tuesday is usually a pretty easy day getting in with your badge. They like scan with a black light. But then by Wednesday and Thursday, they make you show your driver's license every time you enter the Hall, which is super frustrating. And also like, it's so predictable. Tuesday is always never a problem. And then by Wednesday, Thursday, like counterfeit badges start showing up. And so now you have to bring your ID.

But the upside was all of those extra people really made for a more invigorating, electrifying kind of atmosphere. Um, I talked to a bunch of devs who have shown at E3 for many years and they said that having the consumers there really kind of invigorated the people at the booth because some of these smaller games that would be pretty empty, you know, at certain times of the week in previous years, were packed. Every booth had people in it all the time.

I assume because he actually wants to ship a game, you know what I mean? They actually want to do something and complete it and get it out. It's just like, oh God, what is happening over there? Who knows? Andrea, yes, Greg, we come to the final segment for the day, other than Kinda Funny You're Wrong. Uh, this is called Squad Up. Squad Up is simple. It's what you know and love as PS I Love This Best Friend XOXO, but we've now taken that moniker, put it over on to the morning show where you get to",

Squad Up is where you go to KindaFunny.com/KFGd. You don't have to leave a question. You can also leave your Steam name, your Xbox name, your Switch name, your PSN name, what game you need help with, why you want to play with people. And then we read one of them here, just like I'm doing for the PSN user MrOrPIVp117. Hey guys, I got the PlayStation 4 on launch day and played Battlefield 4 with some friends. I can't believe I made it past the server crashes, but now I mostly play alone, whether it's Sports/Shooters, et cetera. However, over the last week and a half, as of writing this, I got back into The Division. I remember Greg talking about it when the recent patches and updates and gameplay and such, and since I hadn't beaten yet, I decided",

I remember Greg talking about it when the recent patches and updates and gameplay and such, and since I hadn't beaten yet, I decided to give it another shot. After completing the main story, I saw that there are different tiers allowing you to get more gear and more XP. I made it past the first mission, I'll be it with some trouble, so I'm reaching out to you and the PSN Best Friends for some help. I want to clear through these missions and revamp my character and possibly even venture into the Dark Zone. Thank you in advance, MrOrPIVp117. That's Mr. for Mister. Squad Up with him, ladies and gentlemen. Go play The Division. It's a great game, great game, a great game. I platted it. You still playing Paragon? Uh, yeah, I played last night. I hadn't tried out the new hero Mokong. I hadn't tried him out yet. I was at E3. He's very challenging. He's like an expert level play kind of character, but you're an expert at this point, right? I mean, yeah, I have, I",

He's like an expert level play kind of character, but you're an expert at this point, right? I mean, yeah, I have, I mean, I have like 500 hours into that game. Um, but I mean, there are certain characters that you have to spend a lot of time with to learn how to play. I mean, anybody who plays MOBAs out there understands that like, I mean, to get to get expert level with a single character, I mean, you kind of have to spend like solid like 20, 30 hours minimum with them, kind of like how good I am with the counselors now on Friday the 13th. Yeah, expert level Friday the 13th player, ladies and gentlemen. This is Kinda Funny Games Daily for Monday, June 19th, 2017. Thank you so much for stopping by, trying on the show.

So let's see what, what's happening. This is over on KindaFunny.com forums under Kinda Funny Games Daily: You're Wrong. Um, oh, this is people talking about the system in general. This is, this, you can try that though. Great idea. Here we go.

So I guess for Rocket League doesn't need another account and we'll do cross-play. Yeah, so I see you're saying instead we were talking about Minecraft, but maybe I screwed that up or whatever. Um, Trevor Starkey, friend of the show, says, \"Read the Fast Pass discussion. PlayStation had their Experience PlayStation app that allowed attendees to sign up for demo appointments. These opened up gameplay or theater demos in two waves throughout the day if you were lucky enough to get there.\" So somebody, not a correction per se, but blah, blah, so you got me on that one, Trevor. I read the whole thing and then you said it's not a correction, so there you go. Uh, and then yeah, okay, from October 30th, 2015, it is confirmed that Media Molecule is bringing uh, Dreams to PlayStation VR. All right, but I don't know if that's what held it up because again, that's 2015. God, sort the hell out, Media Molecule.",

I'm always afraid I'm going to screw it up. I think I nail it every time. I don't know. I just feel like I'm going to, you, you see me bumble through our own URL for questions here, and that's why individual letters can be tough to do when you're not reading it. Yeah, exactly. Letters are tough. Letters are so hard, you guys. Uh, Andrea will be back with me on Wednesday for another episode of Kinda Funny Games Daily. Tomorrow it'll be the one and only Tim Gettys. Until then, it's been our pleasure to serve you. That's one in the bank, Andy. Oh, we revamped all the Patreons. Go there.",
