With me today, Greg, what's wrong with you? I can't hold. It was too good. Spider-Man: Homecoming was too good, Nick. It was too good. It was, it had no business being this good. The trailers we went back and forth on for a long time, were they hit or miss? Were they good? I thought they were good, but they were showing too much in the movie. We were worried about that. And then Tim's a bigger Spider-Man fan than me. He's like a Superman fan that I am, but he's for Spider-Man. But he was saying like he, he wasn't sold on, he didn't think he was sold on it. Then the posters, the posters were **** terrible. And then we went and saw this movie last night, ladies and gentlemen, and holy ****, ****, holy ****, ****, it was perfect. It was perfect. It was a perfect superhero. Before we go, for those of you watching at home, we are going to get into this right",

We are doing, we're doing a full Kinda Funny Reacts. We'll bring in Tim, Kevin will chime in more, I'm sure. No spoilers. This is just, this is just a, I can't hold it in any longer. I couldn't come home and I couldn't talk to Jen about it last night. There's no one else on the internet to talk to about it. There was no way to talk about it. So you just have to spoiler-free say this movie was too good. So you liked it a lot? I didn't. I mean, like that was the thing going into it. You and I drove over there and my thing driving in was like, I'm like, I need, I need this one to be good 'cause I've made the joke a lot on these show that we do and the fact that I'm a DC Fanboy. Yes, the only Marvel character I ever connected with was Spider-Man.",

And the fact that every DC movie's got to be like, man, and then Wonder Woman, the one I'm not like super, I'm like, I like Wonder Woman fine, that's the one that's got to be amazing, right? So it's like, I'm like, he's amazing in Civil War. Clearly they'll **** this up. Sony's going to **** this thing up left, right, and God damn it, did they not **** it up? And here's what I want to say, spoiler-free of course, and you might be, oh, he's overhyping. I did not overhype this movie. You're going to be great. You're going to love it. Don't worry about it.

Take that out of the equation. Take it out, throw it out, throw it out with a bath. What I, literally as soon as I woke up this morning, I started thinking about this movie again. And what I went back to was the fact that in a land of superhero movies that we leave like, that was fine. It was, it was good. It was another Marvel movie, whatever. I, there were legitimate surprises in this movie. There is a moment in this movie when the audience literally collectively went, and then it was like, I haven't been in a movie like that in forever where something happens on and you as total left turn and every talking about it.

What I liked about it a lot was that it felt like a Marvel movie. Yeah, right? You see the Sony, you see the Sony emblems at the beginning, right? This is still Sony Pictures joint Marvel Disney movie, right? Um, but what I liked is that it just, it really lived up to the title Homecoming. It really felt like Spider-Man was home. He's in this universe. And the only, and it wasn't little nods. It wasn't just Robert Downey Jr. It was like that movie from start to finish is embedded in the fabric of that universe. That's **** beautifully. And it really, I think it does a lot of justice to Spider-Man. And I really think it's for the, like again, I'm not one of those detractors or one of those haters who hated The Amazing Spider-Man",

I thought they were great. But I feel like this is a great like next evolution of that that really helps tell what like do what Marvel's trying to do. Exactly. And for to bring up all those different movies, it was funny 'cause going into this one, I'm like, I need this to be good. I want this to be good. I always talk about the fact of leaving Amazing Spider-Man, I'm sorry, leaving Spider-Man, Sam Raimi Spider-Man, and calling my girlfriend at the time 'cause I went to a midnight showing when I was working out on the East Coast and calling her and I was just like, I can't stop smiling.

There were times, and I'm going to **** up my mic, sorry Kevin, where I was watching like the, yeah, like, I mean, they had real, real tension. It's because they set him up. And what I want to talk about is like so many people, no spoilers, so many people talk about, you know, oh my God, the third reboot of this character. But what can they do? This Spider-Man is so endearing and so **** Spider-Man in the way of like that entire, I mean, like the, like he is a different Spider-Man and he is Spider-Man. Yeah, he is.

And they do it and I think they really embrace the youth. They embrace the fact that he's in high school. They embrace that he's, I think he's a sophomore in high school. And the next few Spider-Man movies, Spider-Man movies, Spider-Man movies are going to be, uh, you know, him still in high school, him very much still a kid figuring it out. And I like that. And I don't, yeah, I don't think they're going to get away from that for a long time.

Yeah, I don't, I don't want to go too far, too much farther in it. It's just like, you know what I mean, when you have that like throbbing erection and you just got to touch it. You don't want to, you're, you're in church, but you got to touch it. If I, if I touch it right now, it's either going to do one of two things. It's either going to explode or explode.

Now I was fortunate enough, me, Cool and Kevin were fortunate enough to see Baby Driver about a week and a half or two weeks ago, um, at the Alamo Drafthouse with Edgar Wright and Ansel. I for, I for in the room, not with us though. No, he was hanging out with me. I don't know if you saw him or not. But Edgar was like, was like going like, hey, check this pot out. He's not Australian. I like how you were like, he, check, check this pot out. No, again, you just did Australian again. I still did it. You just did the Australian again.

Really? Okay. Whole, there's a case to be made for both. I just think everything about it was so **** masterfully done. Like it, it was a filmmaker's dream, dude.

I thought I was like, please let them be in this like just be a villain or something. This is the best way can describe Baby Driver as if Edgar Wright directed Heat. Yeah, if they gave Edgar Wright the Heat script or actually here's a better way to describe it. It's what I thought Drive was going to be before I saw Drive, which almost is one of the reasons why it actually made me want to go back and watch Drive again because Drive was so, Drive kind of had that for the first 10 minutes of the film and then went veered off all the way into the totally different lane and",

I think I felt so much tension through a lot of the action. Like there was so many parts where I was sitting there feeling like, oh my God, dude, like this is so **** good. And, uh, the way all the driving scenes were, were, uh, **** choreographed, it was just phenomenal. So good, man. So good. So much style, so much style, man. I love it. In the chat right now, CrownFive says Drive bored me right afterward. Uh, MasterExplorer says Drive is perfect. So you got to love that. You got to love Nicolas was amazing. Drive was great.

This reminded me of Grand Theft Auto, like Grand, playing Grand Theft Auto Online. One guy, a Wheelman. One guy, yeah, one guy, the people who enter the bank or whatever. And right, but with awesome editing and cool characters and really neat things about the different characters that I enjoyed. Like the main character, you know, why he listens to all the music is pretty cool. Uh, it was fun. And I think, I think it landed itself. I thought for at first I was like, this is going to be gimmicky and I don't like, like it, it was it because that's a thin line to skate for or to walk on when you're a filmmaker.

So you should reserve that. Just oozes creativity, man. Like so well done. I love it. If you're a fan of Edgar Wright, of course, you're probably going to go see this movie. You should. It's really fun to see. You should see it anyway. Please, if you've never seen an Edgar Wright film, my favorite Edgar Wright film is probably Hot Fuzz. And then I would go Shaun of the Dead.

Uh, Hot Fuzz is sort of similar to how a lot of video games have like, they improve upon what they did in part one to make the sequel better. Not that this was a sequel, but you know, Shaun of the Dead was good and then it got, and then you could see sort of his, uh, I guess his process improve with Hot Fuzz. How fair? How was the third one of those? I didn't love it. The World's End. I mean, it's still, I still enjoy it, but it's definitely not, it's a lot darker. It's a lot more depressing.
