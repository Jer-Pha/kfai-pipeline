And joining me once again, Candy Andy himself. I'm still here. He's still here. We haven't kicked you out yet. Uh, this is exciting time. We just finished the conference. Some big surprises. Yeah, a lot of uh, little things. I don't know. There there was a lot going on. What's the what's the takeaway? What are we feeling? I am I I'm left mystified. I'm left mystified by this Beyond Good and Evil 2 thing at the end here. I thought it'd be, hey, here's the Beyond Good and Evil 2 trailer. The internet went a Flames. You'd expect it to. And then you expect, look for it this year. We **** around with this before. We know you've been waiting. We're here to deliver. And they didn't do that. They're like, help us make the game, kind of thing. And it was like, so you're and I I tweeted this. I'm like, look forward to playing this game in the 2020s, maybe. Like, what I mean?",

I do not believe this game is any more real now than I did an hour ago. And that's upsetting to me. I but the the last time we saw a CG trailer of Beyond Good and Evil 2 was in 2008 at the Ubisoft conference. That's insane. That is such a long time ago. And the Beyond Good and Evil 1, amazing game. Never played. It's great. It's fantastic. But this is at this point, it's going to be it's a totally different game, right? Like, this is this is something new. I like that they're going for a prequel, 'cause that's kind of a great jump on point for people that haven't played the original one. But the problem is, Greg's absolutely right.

But you can't show that. You earlier you brought up that it's this is similar to The Final Fantasy VII uh remake announcement. I disagree. I think it's more similar to bringing back Last Guardian again, where we all we knew what it was and it kind of died for a long time. And it's will it won't it ever come back type situation. We all wanted it to finally come back. But when it came back, there was a date. Yeah, let me let me just read you this. This is off of Ubisoft's official YouTube page.

And that's just like typical stuff you see like it's like, man, this game's far away. Man, it's just not a good sign at all. Yeah, man, it's upsetting 'cause like it's so hard when it comes to E3. It is about the hype and it is about excitements. I feel like we grade a lot of these conferences in different ways. Like we were talking up last night. We we were upset and the internet's upset that there wasn't any surprises. There wasn't any like one more thing big moment.

And it's there's more people talking about how they're upset than than people talking about how excited they are. M yeah, and it sucks. I feel like that's kind of Ubisoft's conference in a nutshell. And that's how it's been the last couple years where I look down this list. I'm like, these are some great announcements. There's a lot of really great games in there. But when you present it in such a a lazy old school way, it's just not exciting and it's not fun. And I I definitely think that there's a problem with their with how they deliver.

I thought it was a step up from last year. Last year was a major like, what the **** are you doing? Where it was, all right, cool, trailer, talk about it, more gameplay or whatever the **** it was going to be. I thought it was weird right now over on the Ubisoft stream, they're actually doing the playthrough of Assassin's Creed Origins. I thought it was weird to jump out to the outside, show off screen of them playing and then tease to come back. I understand you want people to come back to your stream or whatever.

Like I thought Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, like I hate the Rabbids. Just don't like their character Des. I never have. Uh, but when I got when it finally got to gameplay, not them walking, I was like, oh, it's XCOM. Okay, that's interesting enough. The Crew 2 didn't do much for me. Adding in become the Motorsport Champion, whatever. South Park, of course, I love. Transference. I I was like, that sounds sounds cool. Seems cool. But then it was like, we saw nothing. And I understand you can't sh what what's that? How do you show a game like that? But it's also 2018, a little too far away for it being that far away. Why?

Skull and Bones, I thought started for me personally really high and then fell off where it was like, you know, so many jokes kids have been tweeting back at me of like, yeah, it looks like you wanted more Black Flag. Well, now you're the ship. Like, that's what it's is that what it is? That's what it kind of gives off the vibe of like, are we a pirate that gets off the ship and does stuff or are we just controlling our ship and that's our class and that's our character and we do and smashing of stuff and stuff like that. Just Dance, they got out of real quick. I appreciate that. Quickest they ever have. I I liked how short that that showing was. Yeah, South Park: Phone Destroyer. Okay, cool. Surprise. Sure.

Like, holy ****, I would love this **** if I were a kid. Sure. It's something that I'll probably **** around with on Switch. Uh, yeah, it looks fairly interesting. They got into Steep, which I wasn't expecting them to talk about the expansion. I mean, even going back to Starlink: Battle for Atlas fall 2018, there was a lot of fall 2018 games in this lineup, which is interesting. And and there was a lot coming this year as well. Uh, The Crew. No, even The Crew early 2018. We already knew Assassin's Creed Origins release date was October 27th. But uh, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, August 29th.

And I am super excited for that if it ever actually happens. Uh, but I don't believe that it will. Yeah, yeah, that's the thing is that game seems so far off. I don't know. It's just it was a weird conference. I I think Far Cry, the demo they showed for Far Cry 5 was like, okay, cool. I really do want to play this. The only thing I didn't love about it, I didn't love the the sort of comical vibe that the trailer had, that the Gameplay trailer had. I wish it was more sort of ominous, crazy religious cult thing. Like it became like really fun and like, yeah, this is my problem. When when I saw Far Cry 5 at Judges Week and they gave the thing, they gave it very serious. Like, this is what it is. There's",

Like, this is what it is. There's a cult second of town, blah, blah, blah. And then they showed the gameplay and it was Far Cry game. They run around being crazy. And it's like, it is that weird juxtaposition of how serious the story is going to be versus what it's going to how you're going to actually run through and play and hit people with baseball bats and boom, boom, boom and have your friends join in and run them over with crop dusters. And it's like, you know, I enjoyed again, I keep going back to like the True Detective sort of vibe. It's very serious and very scary. And you know, the this crazy religious cult is sort of, you know, going crazy in this town. But then it's like, hey, it's a it's a buddy cop movie with The Rock and Zac Efron like in this vibe.

That's going to be hard for them to walk that line. But I think if they get away a little bit from trying to make the cult super serious, they will like the father being all tatted up, right? And having the machine gun like finding people with impaled with the cross or whatever. It's like, okay, I I I think the more we get into when you start playing it, hopefully that they'll actually be a tone to it that makes sense for a while. So him singing an Amazing Grace with the rifle in his hand on that alter was just like, oh my God, they're **** nailing this ****. And then when they got into the more fun comical stuff, I just I it kind of lost me. Sure. Still want to play it though. Yeah, I liked how much time they spent on South Park.

But it says, join us, participate, inspire, play. Join the Space Monkey Program and take part in the adventure of developing Beyond Good and Evil 2. Take part in developing the game. I don't like that. What great trying to open this other one that is. Shout out though, we were talking about this throughout the conference. Shout out to Ubisoft's graphics packages and set.

So yeah, I'm happy that there there is steps being took to not be as generic as uh this it kind of came off and as EA continues to come off. Sure. Uh, but this was a lot better than last year where they didn't do the thing where, okay, we're going to keep showing the game over and over and over. Where here's a trailer, then we bring someone else to talk about it, then we show the gameplay of it. It's like, I mean, this was a bit more focused.

So right there, I think it was just out of order in terms of how you should have presented that. Assassin's Creed Origins. Here's the trailer. You want to watch the demo? Watch later. And it was awkward to watch it off screen. So that was awkward. The Crew 2 guy came out or I'm sorry, they showed the trailer and you're like, oh, they're introducing this. And it was a cool trailer. Like Inception. Everything's wrapping around. You're like, all right, cool. Then it was like another weird not trailer trailer where it was like the split. Like they had all the different cuts of like the different uh it's a car, it's a plane, it's a whatever. And then going in and out of it. It's like, I would have rather seen straight gameplay",

And that I think The Crew 2 is the one for me that like I was interested in The Crew 1 when they announced it and when I originally played it. And then when it came out, it was just know it didn't come together. The Crew 2, this one should have been a slam dunk in terms of we've taken your feedback, we've listened. Here's a mission on land, a mission in the air. We've showed you what this game is going to be rather than make it look like you're also racing on tracks, but you are still driving across the country, but you are still flying across the country.

Skull and Bones was weird. Again, awesome trailer followed up by this demo of like, oh, this wasn't what the trailer looked like. And I thought when you talked about it being, you know, this Just Dance was fine. But it's a usual thing. I guess that's the thing is like like I me when I go through these things part by part, there's so few that they nailed. I think they nailed South or Far Cry 5. I think they nailed Beyond Good and Evil 2 till they came out and were like very awkward. They should have had a message there of we're developing it and we're targeting this.

Also, I'm a little sad we didn't see any old IPs revived. We also didn't hear anything about um the Rayman Definitive Edition or anything like that. I'm sure it'll be a throwaway thing tomorrow's Nintendo Direct. But yeah, yeah, overall, I mean, it good conference, decent conference, but not nothing special. The problem is they just didn't nail enough. There weren't enough I I'm was talking on on an announcement presentation level. There weren't enough 10 out of 10. Like one by one, every every everything we just went through. I think there was something that was a little bit off with the exception of a few.

Been tempered expectations. But that's the thing. Can Sony pull it off for that three-peat? The thing with Sony, right, is that if I think their biggest problem will be tonight that they are going to come out, you assume, and talk about so many things we know about.
