I know you can only talk about what you know, what you've been through with Bethesda, but do you see that policy becoming more standard in the video game industry at large? Cause I, we always talk about it, me in particular, when I bring up this argument, is the fact that when I first started, I mean, there was, there was that middling, I'm a B-tier, A-tier, I'm a THQ game, right? But it's the same thing you just talked about, that you guys are cutting and running on games because it's not up to our standards. We don't want it, right? And that's why when people see Bethesda on the box, that means something, whereas I can sit there and say, you're licensed mid-tier, I'm a weird racing game that doesn't need to exist. I'm Crush Hour is a THQ game, and THQ isn't around",

And then you earlier, we had, you know, Shadow of the Colossus up, which makes you think Last Guardian, and you saw Sony of that age, the the PS PS3, like, take all the time you need. And then now with PlayStation 4, you see them cutting first-party studios and saying, we don't want this, and not, you know, I mean, like, they feel, they seem more proactive as somebody who watches them on the industry. I I think that's, I think that's fair to say. I mean, the truth of the answer is, is what you said, which is, I I don't, I don't really know. I'm sort of at best a casual observer, and I tend to pay a lot more attention and focus a lot more on what what we're doing and what my team is doing and what our devs are doing, then I really focus on external forces, because there's any number of cases in in in",

Facebook gaming became a massive thing, and everybody was grabbing studios and throwing games out because that was the big thing. Like, well, if I just looked at what everybody else was doing, like, well, we would have gone running down that path too. Sure. You know, it's not not like it's up to me, but if there telling everybody what to do, Howard's like, yes, sir, right? I'll get right to programming. In no universe has that ever happened. But, um, you know, we we we didn't go running after that, 'cause we were focused on like, okay, that's nice, but that's not what we do. And that when everybody went crazy with like handheld, uh, casual market games for DS and whatever else, like, we didn't go running after that either.",

That's that's not what we do. Um, you know, we we the the first really big entry that we had into the mobile space was Fallout Shelter, which was quite the big entry, was was a big entry, but also like, you could look at that and say like, does that feel like a Bethesda game? And I think most folks would pretty quickly say, yeah, like, it felt true to Fallout. It was interesting. It did things differently as it related to in-app purchases or how much it did or didn't feel like it was trying to reach for your wallet. It was pretty pretty, uh, casual with that, but it it fit the tone and vibe of Fallout. It was fun and tactile and just kind of struck a chord.

And everybody's like, yeah, like, that seems awesome. I would totally play that. And, you know, those are the kinds of things that we want to back, things that the devs believe in and that feel like they come from our DNA of having something special to bring to the table that maybe not everybody else is is doing. And the extent to which that's happening around the industry is not really my thing, but certainly in even just in the last few weeks, we've seen like this being canceled or like this project isn't isn't going to happen. Like, I I do think that folks are getting more and more discerning about how long they're going to run this along before they make a decision, because in the past, it's probably true that in most cases, it was just even if it",

Um, but I I just don't think that's the case anymore. Not with the number of releases, all of the indie stuff that's out there. Like, people have too many choices, all the free-to-play stuff. You've got to compete with time for a that somebody does even have to any money on to download and play for hundreds of hours. Like, that's, you know, that is a challenge. You really have to step up your game. Do you think it's because you're starting to see as the industry ages, as we all mature, uh, somebody catching up where it's the art catching up to the business side of it? Because the business side of it before was like, yep, Finding Dory is huge, or Finding Dory Explorers, who I'm thinking of, but Finding Dory would work",

We don't give a flying **** if it's good or bad. You know what I mean? Like, that was the thing. Whereas now you see Marvel reaching out and being like, all right, or Disney reaching out and being like, all right, cool, we put a, we have a Marvel video game guy, Bill, in charge. He will then tell you what's doing. We're going to partner with the best people. We're going to put money behind it. Some will be exclusive, some won't.

And I remember going to E3 and seeing all, it was funny, like, uh, I I must have been the Grim Reaper of of game journalists, because all the companies that I was assigned to, they were just going out of business left left and right. Uh, you know, Fox Interactive and and all of these folks who were doing the same kinds of stuff. You know, video games were like, oh, like, everybody run in, like, this is where all the money is. And just anybody can put up a stake your claim and put out stuff and people will buy it. And the exact same thing happened that you're talking about.

You know, we just saw Disney essentially leave the business in terms of formally publishing their own stuff. Now they're obviously still doing some smaller things here and there, but certainly not what they were doing before, like shutting down Disney Infinity, all of that stuff. I remember in 1996, 97, 98, where all of these companies, GT Interactive and Fox and all these other folks had stuff, and it just the next day they just weren't there. They were all gone. Um, and uh, so I I do think it kind of comes and goes in cycles. Certainly today compared to, you know, 97, 98 is apples and oranges. There's so much more going on. And again, going to the indie stuff, like an avenue like Steam means that anybody can put out a game and doesn't need a publisher. You can go direct to the consumer.

And you know, to the consumer, they don't, they don't necessarily care like where the game comes from. If it strikes a chord and resonates with them, I mean, I'd like to think to your point that like, yes, it means something to somebody that we're making Dishonored 2, that hopefully that says something about, you know, we're working with Arkane and we're doing something that's interesting and unique and it's really going to push things. But I'm trying to get you to part with your money.

And so using that example of a Dishonored 2, this is something I asked you yesterday, so bear with me, but I'll put a new spin on it for you, which I maybe I will, maybe I it's not like people don't ask me the same question over and over. We had a really good conversation. We you kept saying that was a good question. I was like, we we we did it. We did have some good questions. Uh, no, the question was yesterday that I think stands is, what is success to you guys and how do you set expectations? Because like I was saying yesterday, Dishonored 2 drops, and I thought that was an interesting sequel to make, because I remember when Dishonored came, people loved it.

It had like your Mitch Dyer's and it had your video game critics really liked this game, but we knew it didn't set the world on fire in terms of like unit sold, right? Like it it has an audience, people love it. It reminds me a lot of like Mirror's Edge, right? Where like, sure, that game people enjoy. All right, cool. And there's like a sect that think it's amazing. Okay, great. Dishonored 2 comes around and again, it's Game of the Year. People are giving it crazy scores. It's awesome. But it seems like it doesn't set the world on fire again sales were. Are you guys expecting that? What is that a successful game to you? Because it spoke to the Dishonored audience and it got these scores that you guys like, or is it like, we expected more out of that?

And then everyone talked about it to the point that when Uncharted 2 came, there were millions more PS3s on the streets. So people like, oh, I've heard about this game. Sure. And then they dropped and it went off. Uh-huh. Uh, I mean, the answer to your question is, we look for success to come in a variety of forms, obviously. Um, those come from different places. So the developers can spend all of their time making and developing the best game possible. And while we involve them in sales and marketing, a promotion, so that they're they're vested in and a part of that and can help guide it and make sure what we're doing is true to the game and the game experience,",

So, you know, you don't want your devs focused too much on on those things because it's not really in their control. Just like you don't want, I mean, you want sales and marketing to be bought into the vision that the devs have and be able to take it and explain it to their audience, but it's not my team or sales or anybody else's job to make the game more fun or to make this level more interesting or whatever. Like, that's not why we hired you and that's not why we hired them. So you want across all of your different disciplines for people to have success in in the areas that matter to them.

You want the sales. You want it to be a commercial viable success to sell copies, because we are a business. We're not the National Endowment for the Arts, right? We don't have a giant bucket of money that we, you know, sort of grab and hand to a developer and say, okay, you take this off and go make your piece of art. Whenever you're done, sweet.

The answer to your question is, do I think Dishonored 2 is a a success? Um, for for what it was, certainly.

Like, having this thing where you're looking into the past and then everything else rendering around you is in the present. Like, it's just, it's crazy how they pulled that up. From a sales standpoint, there's never been a game where I said, we sold enough. We should really stop. Like, could we not, could we not sell anymore Fallout? Seriously, you're embarrassing me. Like, yeah, like, Skyrim, there was no pause where it was like, guys, really, it's too much. Just just keep it. We, you know, we'll put it back on sale later.

Like, 'cause it was 30 bucks last year and it was 30 bucks six months ago, but today for some reason, you're like, I got to have that for 30 bucks. Um, so you you do get longer, uh, longer tails. And I think we try and take a a wider vision, but every game has got to be its own thing. You can't, you can't say, look, everything has to be Skyrim or Fallout 4 or or it's an abject failure.

It was our first stab at it. There there had been Fallout games and one and two and they're two of the greatest games ever made, but they weren't made by us. And Fallout 3 was the first one that we made that says, this is how we think about Fallout and what a Fallout game is for us. And it was really well received and kind of sent ripples in a way through like what people expected and the tone and the vibe and and all of that stuff. And when you do another one, well, it's not, it's not the first one again. Um, to your point, like, there's going to be some commonalities.

Understand. And there's numbers and role playing, right? You just like, well, how is that supposed to have the same impact in Fallout 4? Like, it it it evolved and it was a little different, but you still knew what it was. Like, it wasn't like it shocked you or caught you off guard. So I I do think there's something to that. But to answer your question, Fallout 4 has got to be the most successful game we've ever launched in our company's history, more than Skyrim in terms of like what we did.

And so, you know, I feel the same way about if you played Uncharted 4 and that was your first game, I think you have a very different reaction to what that game is than if like me, you played one, two, and three, because Uncharted 4 is more of one, two, and three. Like, ending is one of my favorite endings in the game ever. It was mind-blowingly good. But like, it means something. You have all that history. I went out of order. So my first Uncharted was Uncharted 2, and then I went back to one and then played three. Um, but my first interaction with Uncharted 2 and seeing those cutscenes was transcendent. Like, I had never played a game where I cared so much about the cutscenes. And my wife would stop whatever she was doing 'cause she wanted to watch and see the and I wasn't allowed to play the game",

And my wife would stop whatever she was doing 'cause she wanted to watch and see the and I wasn't allowed to play the game when she wasn't around 'cause she wanted to see what was happening, how the story was progressing. Like, if I had played one, my reaction to that isn't the same, because I would have had exposure to this is how these guys tell story and cutscenes and character and it's really good. Um, I I just I think that's true for a lot of stuff. Fallout 4 is in that respect no different. So this is, you're not going to answer, well, you you'll dance. Well, that I'm going to get to that in a second too. Hold on. But do you think then for the next Fallout you guys make, do you think it'll be like, is there is there a in the studio, is there an idea of like, we got to be so different next time? We have to go in a different direction, or is it, we had a lot of great stuff and we just need to iterate and change and make it still feel like what",
