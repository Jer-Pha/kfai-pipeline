I thought the new thing was going to be lights off, you do the countdown to the mics going live, then you're going to bring up the lights when we were live and we would all start talking. You wouldn't have to point and do the snap and the point anymore. No, that was just your stupid idea. That was a really good idea that I think it works. Sounds sounds way better than what you... Thank you. What was wrong with what I did? Cause the way you do it is just like, it's never consistent. I feel like the lights going up, yeah, orchestra roar into life. I feel like we'd be like, all right, cool, now we're in the headspace of put on a great morning show. Yeah, now it's just kind of, we're sitting there waiting, we don't know when to start yapping way. Yeah, why? We know when to start, but I just, I feel like from the moment, moment you hit the buttons, you do",

The lights would be perfect. I motion that the lights be the new signal for going live. Like normally it's lights, camera, action, but we're, we want camera lights to trigger the action. True. 100%. See, and right now Kenzo 989 agrees with me in the chat. Yeah, but he's crazy. Can I, can you second my motion? I mean, I'm down to try it. The motion carries. My thing is, I, we have the votes, we have the vote. We need to change something about this, 'cause this doesn't work. Why doesn't it work? I don't, it works totally fine. There is TBY Studio says Greg is right, Kevin is being stubborn and wants his ways to, it wants to stay in his own ways. I'm asking you to start with me, Kevin, to join me on this.",

I'll try to make it happen tomorrow, but there, that moment of silence is like, just hold for a second before the camera starts going. I understand, but I'm saying if you want to have a countdown for the camera, be like, well, that I can't see that. What do you mean you can't? Not over here. He just looks like you have your paw up. I can't see what number that is. I'm looking at the camera. I need to address the camera. What I'm saying is that is why I snap. But I'm, but I know, but again, what I'm saying is this is what you do. Like, there's definitely someone watches this show, correct?

You killed it at D.I.C.E. You did damn good. Thank you to the chat. I was watching backstage, of course, chiming in on the, the people watching here on Twitch.tv/KindaFunnyGames. D.I.C.E. was a lot of fun. I'm sorry the crowd wasn't more into it. I learned something. That's my, I learned that I, I, I took it for granted that we have such great audiences everywhere we go. Yeah, we go to RTX. This is a solid point. We go to PAX and I forget, of course, that like, and even Game Awards, I forget that there's so many fans in the audience that when I went there and these were buttoned up developers, people who are there, you know, being respectful, probably don't even want to be there.

If I get a chance next year, I guarantee you there will be ad-lib Greg Miller in the beginning screaming, yelling, jumping off there, grabbing Shuhei, shaking him, pushing him up, punching Neil Druckmann, right? Eny, right? You just got to come. Exactly. That's a, that's a solid point. And so it was, it was a different, it was a different energy. You're fancy gentleman now, hosting fancy Video Game Awards. I like it. You're stepping up, you're evolving. I try. I'm trying to, trying to take this thing somewhere. I, I really enjoyed that it was you and Chobot. It was like a, a reunion party.

They, they were like, the crowd. I'm like, I guess the crowd isn't that great. And then it got to me. I'm like, are we doing okay? Here's the takeaways. Yes, chat was positive. Yes, reaction on the internet was actually pretty positive. Usual Greg Miller is a funny thing. I understand. **** you, I'm popular, you're not. And then everybody who talked to us afterwards went out of their way to say they enjoyed it. And not just though, good job, but like, oh, this was so much better than last year.

Yeah, like, I've seen a whole bunch of these things, but like, you guys are obviously, we're not reading off prompters, have a chemistry together. And I was like, and that was, that was the big takeaway that a lot of the, the feedback I got from a lot of people were that our best parts were when we had living people were turning to look at the thing. And so it needs to be more, I think, like Final Fantasy. But now that not taking away from the fact that D. Duer wrote excellent jokes. Yes, exactly. All that amazing, amazing.

But a big part of that is I want the energy of the room to come across on video, which means I need to get all the right audio clips where you hear the audience actually reacting. So the problem there is they need to mic up the audience, which is something we need to do this year, Kinda Funny Live 3, because we haven't done that before. But, uh, that, that was the problem is like, even if there was in the room an energy, it doesn't come across because they're trying to get the what people saying, the energy on there. And you see this in a lot of live concert videos when you see people's, uh, like DVD specials of their concerts.

Great long-distance girlfriend. Fantastic. Most importantly, this little ****. Oh yeah. Holy goddamn, Kevin, do I enjoy the Nintendo Switch? No, they're not paying me to say it. I love it.

It's one of those things, you know, it's been the roller coaster with me and then this from the NX, from X, trying to give it to us and all that.

There is no, uh, man, I'll tell you what, Nintendo Switch. I was, I, since I got to hold it, I like the form factor of it.

But even when I was like standing at the gate waiting for Jen to board the plane, I was sitting there playing Zelda. Nobody had any questions. Nobody did anything. I, I was playing at at the gate at Virgin and like this girl next to me who I could tell didn't really know what was going on, but she kept looking over at me and then eventually she was like, hey, that's the new thing, right?

Top story, keeping with the Switch information over at Kotaku. Mike Fahey says, not all Switch games will support TV mode. Yes, not all Nintendo Switch games are going to take advantage of the console's dual TV/portable nature. Released last year for iOS and Android, rhythm game Voez is now a Japanese Switch launch title and it requires a touchscreen to play. Doesn't this mean we're in for, does this mean we're in for a flood of tablet ports? Yes, the latest game. You don't think so? I don't think so. I, I mean, I, I think indies, some of them will port things over, but I think it's, it, this means we'll get more things like Severed. Yeah.

It is a problem PlayStation has as you see like Life of Black Tiger and all these shitty things coming out. But again, it's also a free market. I don't know if we need to go in there and yeah, I mean, for me, this is good news because there's just more options to be able to play games.

Also not in the mood to play. I'm not going to play that game. Can I play Zelda both ways? Can I play Mario both ways? Can I play the games you'd expect and have been promised to play both ways? Yep.

It's not super long, but I'm read. Jordan Horowitz knew something was wrong the moment he saw people in headsets scurrying across the Oscar stage. Only a minute earlier, Faye Dunaway had said the words that Mr. Horowitz had longed to hear, La La Land, as she announced the Best Picture Winner for the 2017 Academy Awards. Mr. Horowitz, a producer on that film and colleagues and C members raced to the stage. Mr. Horowitz spoke first, quote, thank you to the academy, he began.

They asked me to see my envelope, which I haven't opened, he recalled. Clearly something was wrong. They open the envelope and it says Emma Stone, La La Land. So clearly something is not right. The guys in headsets were going around with urgency looking for the other envelope. It just kind of appeared, he said. One of the guys opens it and says Moonlight. And I took and I took it on stage and went to the microphone and said what I said what Mr. Horowitz said what Mr. Horowitz said, there's a mistake. Moonlight, you guys won Best Picture.

And so it goes on like that. But I mean, the big thing I think to shout out, of course, is how well the La La Land handled it, dude.

And like the fact that they interrupted it mid speech, they didn't let it go. They didn't whatever. Like I thought it was handled as well as humanly possible. And La La Land took it very well.

So when Sony needed to decide how many of its virtual reality headsets to manufacture, Mr. House was among those inside the company advising that Sony make fewer of them. It's the classic case of any in any organization, the guys who are on the front end in sales are getting very excited, very hyped up. Mr. House says, \"Yes, you have to temper that with other voices inside the company, myself among them, saying let's just be a bit careful.\" It turns out Mr. House was too cautious. The headset, PlayStation VR, has been scarce in many stores, especially in Japan, since it went on sale in October. In an interview at a Silicon Valley office on Friday, Mr. House revealed PlayStation VR sales for the first time, saying consumers had purchased 915,000 of the headsets as of February 19th, roughly 4 months after it went on sale.

This is great because yeah, it does benefit a streamer if they want to opt in, if they want to be a part of it, because they could easily not benefit them at all. And within the, I mean, if you don't sign up, it doesn't benefit. It's still there. So exactly.

I know you're eating and drinking, so I don't know why why I don't know. It's just the excitement. He literally gets so excited his little brain fries out. I don't know. Holy ****.

So just no shows at all next week for the Kinda Funny Morning Show. Two silver linings to it. Number one, this week, Colin's doing a whole bunch of Colin Was Right interviews.
