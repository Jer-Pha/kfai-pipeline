The watchmaker's goal is to change the way consumers think about fashion by offering high quality, minimalist products at revolutionary prices. With over 500,000 watches sold in more than 160 countries around the world, MVMT Watches has solidified itself as the world's fastest growing watch company. MVMT Watches started just $95, and at a department store you're looking at 400 to 500 bucks, buddy. MVMT figured out that by selling online, they were able to cut out the middle and retailer markup, providing the best possible price. Classic design, stylized minimalism. I said minimalism, you understand what I mean. There's all these watches, we have a bunch here. We use them when we wear suits, we being me. I don't know what the other guys do.

My topic, my topic is stand-up comedy. Nice. So, uh, this has kind of like hit me from all angles in my life, I feel, in the last month or so. Uh, we did our New Year's resolution episode. Nick was talking about he wanted to do a stand-up thing in the future and want to make that happen. Interest, wanted to work on it, whatever.

And uh, when I moved in with Gia recently, there's been the question of like, what do we watch on TV? Like just when the TV's on, sure. Like when she's cooking, I, I'll be working or whatever. And it's hard because like I don't want to commit to like watching a, a real show. They have to like follow the narrative and like, no, no, Man in the High Castle, none of this like attention to, right? Like no, uh, but something that we both need to like, you know, get on the same level and be able to discuss, because we like talking, it's kind of our thing.

Granted, I understand, guys, I'm very late to Netflix, but this is happening now and I'm welcoming it into my life. I've watched a lot of stand-up in the last good month and I'm super, who, who are some of your favorites? Uh, John Mulaney. Yeah, he's definitely got a special on Netflix. He does. And uh, we, I first heard him on our um, drive back from LA that we did. That's right. At some point where we listened to uh, New in Town. Yeah. And that special, I think from top to bottom, is just like **** perfect. If you haven't seen it, highly recommended. But his new one on Netflix, The Comeback Kid, man. Yeah, you liking it?

And I'm like, with stand-up, sometimes you have to get used to the guy's voice a little bit, you know? Like not his physical voice, but just his, his style of comedy. So I've gone through like eight or nine of them and finally found Bill Burr's uh, latest special. And I was like, oh my God, this, I've never listened to like, heard of Bill Burr's stand-up act before. **** blew me away. Funny. Burr, I need, I've never heard, need to get into it. Recently, we went out with uh, TonsOfFun and he was talking about how, yeah, he's his favorite in that. Bill Burr is, I mean, Bill Burr is like comedy royalty.

So it was a lot of just like the random Comedy Central specials, even like just roasts and stuff, which were like contained stand-up segments. Um, so I'd be familiar from that. But then there was like Russell Peters, who was really big, still huge. Russell Peters, is he really huge now? Yeah, holy ****. Russell Peters is probably of the biggest stand-up comedians on the planet, which is crazy. He sells out arenas in like Europe, like, like soccer **** arenas. It's crazy because he's on, he does podcast rounds every once in a while because he's obviously they're all friends. And so you'll hear him, he just come like, he's just balling up right now, man.

But like, think, he never stopped, but he never actually did a mainstream movie. He just kept doing a stand-up career. Like, I mean, I guess he's done some movies, things like that. It's unfair to say, but he never did what Chris Rock did, right? Which was go, \"I'm going to stop doing stand-up because my movies career is taking off and I'm going to start producing and like directing and like being a huge star.\" And that's what kind of catapulted him, similar to what Kevin Hart's doing right now too, which is like over the past three years, Kevin Hart's gone from being prominently thought of as a stand-up comedian to being a huge movie star with three movies coming out every year that like, the movies are so like, he's has so many movies.

Well, any Russell Peters, I remember being really into that first stand-up special that I remember watching like uh, top to bottom was John Leguizamo's uh, holics, man. That **** was **** awesome.

Yeah, Mike Ducker was number two. He was phenomenal as always. Um, but you know, they said some **** in there where we were like, if I said that over dinner with people who didn't know me, I would be looked at as a pariah at that point. But you know, because, because you're in that setting, you all sort of agree to be like, we're going to listen with sort of this open mind and be willing to, to laugh at, at these ridiculous things.

That's every election, right? It seems like that always. I know this was like way more ramped up than, see, I would go the opposite where I think honestly, streaming's brought stand-up to a different level. I'm, I have, I'm, I'm catching with a lot of the older ****. I'm staying away from any of the, but it's like every time you sign on to Netflix, there's a new stand-up special. That's what I went.

He's a fluffy guy, right? Yeah, exactly. But I mean, like every time I go on Netflix now and I see like the Netflix banner on a bunch of comedy specials, because there's just, they're there. And it's weird because growing up for me, me, like I feel like Saturday nights and even Friday nights, I feel like Friday nights was always TGIF, eating pizza with the family. 2000, because I wanted to be terrified. And then usually Fox would have a bunch of stand-up stuff from the Laugh Factory. And you know, Larry the Cable Guy and Jeff Foxworthy. Well, yeah, Jeff a little bit there at the end.

And it was, you, okay, cool, stand-up's happening, but it is a thing to go to. But how you, and now with streaming, it does feel like it's, that's a good point. That's a good point. Yeah, I mean, it feels especially since like a perfect analogy for that is we were talking a lot, we were watching the roast at the old place before we got in the new studio. And you brought up Anthony Jeselnik. That kind, I'd never heard of him before. Who's my favorite? I love Anthony Jeselnik.

I just saw him uh, earlier in the year in San Diego uh, at a stand-up. And it was **** awesome. He's just awesome. And and just, just great. Just observational. Just, just PG-13, but still like you, like he's the funniest guy that doesn't get raunchy really, you know? As opposed to Larry David, who's funnier when he's raunchy.

Everything's going to be fine. Yeah, you know.

And that's happened before too, where something gets, gets videoed and cut out. And then even Jeselnik, who like when there's a national tragedy, there's a school shooting, he is tweeting about it in that moment. He's tweeting out punch l or whatever.

That not social contract. If I'm following Tosh, if I'm following Jeselnik, I know what I'm involved. If I'm seeing them, I know what I'm involved in. And did you see this thing with the SNL writer over the weekend? Yeah, this SNL writer, she made fun of Trump's youngest kid. I don't know if she made, I, I think the joke's funny personally. But it was, yeah, like he's the, what, what's his young son name? Barron's going to be, Barron Trump is going to be the first, last name is Barron. No, Barron. Yeah, it's dope. Barron Trump is going to be the first supervillain, first uh, 10-year-old at home or homeschooled school shooting or whatever it is. It is a funny joke.

I know like Ducker, who's a writer, does stand-up, blah, blah, blah. I don't know this woman's background at all. But clearly she wasn't ready to be thrust on that thing. And the people following her weren't necessarily ready for that. And like then it just becomes this whole thing.
