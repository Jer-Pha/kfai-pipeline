The the the blossom, the what are they, the cherry blossom trees, they're around me. They're they're going to slowly ascend and descend over time. Kevin made sure to have a beautiful loop going. Thank you for this. This new, this is the magic and power of a LED video wall where anything is possible. Kevin, could you do me a favor at some point and get a stopwatch up in the somewhere so I know how long I'm going, okay? Because there's not really a time limit on these videos. I'm just going to kind of sit here and answer your questions you left for me over at Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames for this beautiful month of February 2017. I'm joined by by two of my my very good, I don't know what I'd even call you guys at this point, friends. You ****. Yeah, we got we got Kevin and Cool Greg. They're over there.

And also we do this on on Kinda Funny's Patreon as well. This month is Nick. You should go watch that one. That'll be fun. I love that most of our content is just talking about other content. Like that's all that is. It is really. There's not much more substance to it, but this one has a cherry blossom tree. They're good luck, don't you know? Let's get right into it.

When I finish that, I want to play some games I missed out on, assuming I'll have access to them on the Switch. What are five or more must-play games in your opinion from the Wii to Wii U era? Well, buddy, I got some bad news for you. Uh, Virtual Console not going to be ready for who God knows how long. We know it's coming, but it won't be there for the launch of the Switch. And even worse, like I can almost assure you that uh there won't be Wii or Wii U on Virtual Console. So those games just aren't common. There'll be Wii U ports, and of those, there will be many on the Nintendo Switch. So get hyped about that. Um, but to answer your question anyways, games from the the Wii and",

Mario Galaxy 1 and 2. Shout out to Super Smash Bros. Brawl because it means so much to my life. But at this point, Smash Bros. for Wii U is out, and hopefully by the time you're watching this, Smash Bros. for Switch will be announced at some point. Being a Wii U anyways, that that one's better. So just like you can just play that and it'll be it'll be fine. But on on the Wii, like the Wii was such a time and place console. Um, there's things like Zelda: Twilight Princess, which is a great game, and I feel like a lot of people give it too much ****.

I mean, yeah, obviously I talked about Mario Galaxy 1 and 2. New Super Mario Bros. I mean, you played one, you played them all, you know? Uh, if I had to give any a shout out, it would be the Wii U one, New Super Mario Bros. U. Uh, you can skip Mario Kart Wii. So here's where things get interesting. I feel like the Wii U just kind of did the Wii better. So let let's just jump right over to to the Wii U. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, one of the best platform games of all time, and I feel like it doesn't get enough love because everyone loves to hit on the Wii U specifically.

There's a lot of Mario. I really like Mario. What what are you going to do? You going to **** give me **** for it? Are you going to give me **** for a Kev? Yeah, right. Bayonetta 2. Obviously, many people played Bayonetta 1, but then when they made it uh Wii U exclusive, it kind of like **** things up for everybody else. But whatever. I mean, it's a fantastic game, lots of fun there. Uh, the thing is like Wii U games, most of them are now playable also on other places like the 3DS, like Yoshi's Woolly World. It's a great game. I'm not going to give it like the highest praise, but now can play it on 3DS. So you can do that. But the ones that I stand by, I'll give it to Smash",

Um, so there there you go. Stay away from Mario Party 10, Star Fox Zero, and uh Paper Mario: Color Splash kind of sucked a dick too, you know? Jiren Dorsy says, hey Tim, do you find it ironic that Sonic and Mario appear to have great games coming this year, tossing the Crash Collection, and us '90s kids are living the dream? What's another platforming franchise you would love a remake for or just a new game? I myself would love a new Ape Escape or Spyro collection similar to what they've done with Crash.

The remake they did was fantastic, and I think has kind of ushered in this idea that there can be $40 games that are super polished and aren't necessarily going to sell bazillions of copies. Um, so they did such a good job with Ratchet. I feel like Spyro could be fun. I have such uh love for and like nostalgia for Crash that that's my franchise. So even back then, I was always a Crash guy over a Spyro guy. But I'd love an excuse to like give Spyro another shot, but I don't see myself actually like I'm going to beat the three Crash games when they come out. If a Spyro collection came out, I'd probably play most of the first one, but never actually beat it, and then just not play the others. You know what I mean?

But uh what's it called? Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links. I think I gave a shout out to it on the Gamescast a couple weeks ago. Yeah, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links on an iPhone. Holy ****. It's Yu-Gi-Oh! in the palm of your hand. They did a great job with it. Um, but yeah, VR could be really dope for that. Um, we've seen kind of that style of St. not VR, but on the PS3, there was that the card game game, and it like uh made the or like the EyeToy on PS2.

Yeah, no one would have seen Sega leave, and then they just did, you know? Yeah, I I think that we're kind of in a place where it would be extremely difficult for a new console maker to come into the fray, as we saw with Steam. It would really require a kind of full assault, like a full focused assault on the living room. And Steam didn't do that. Steam, if Steam were dedicated, this is the Steam Box, and not say these are the Steam Boxes, I think it would have been a different story.

Is it Nintendo? No, really. I mean, there I just my thing is it's not a yes to that. Like there's all the talk of like, oh, the Switch is going to fail, and then they're going to make games for the other consoles. That's not going to happen. And like if it were to happen, that's not what you want because everybody's saying that things they want that.

We're not getting any like all of a sudden it's just going to be just core Mario, core Zelda, core Pok\u00e9mon, and that's it. And like, sure, that's enough for a lot of people. But I love Nintendo for uh the amount of variety in their games. And I feel like to a lot of outsiders, they can look at it and be like, oh man, all they do is Mario games. It's like, okay, well, yeah, Mario is a character and in the title of 10 different games, but they're all different genres. You can't compare Kart and Party and Smash Bros. and um the core Mario 2D games or 3D games or now the 2D 3D games, like the the obstacle based um games that still play out in a 3D way.

Like the cast of Smash Bros. Wii U is like almost 60 characters. Like what was the cast of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale or whatever? There like 20 characters and half of them were evil clones of the other one. It's a disaster. Justin Max says, hey Tim, just finished my first Final Fantasy game. It was 15, and I really liked it. However, I definitely thought there could have been a little more character and plot development without getting into the anime. Which Final Fantasy do you think has the best characters and story?

There's a lot of them that are great, and I feel like 7 is simultaneously the easy answer and also the like it's cool to not say 7 answer because people are just like, oh, 7's overrated. And it's like, no, 7, like 7 is is talked about and remembered the way it is for a reason. I think that reason is it's characters, it's story. In my opinion, I'd give the story to 10, and I'd give characters to to 7. Um, many of them have great characters, many of them great stories, but I there's something about like Yuna's journey in 10, I feel was interesting from a a plot perspective, whereas like the plot of Final Fantasy 7 isn't interesting necessarily, but the characters are what make it",

Hopefully it does the same for Nintendo. I thought the Super Bowl ad was perfect uh to get that in front of a mass market that doesn't know what the Nintendo Switch is. In 30 seconds, they made it very clear what this machine is, can do. So good job, Nintendo. Um, shout out to Imagine Dragons. They bring the hotness with them. Sweet, sweet tunes.

I know you guys get asked all the time about how to get a career in the industry, but I have a more specific career on this front. How would you recommend pursuing career in the industry in 2017, particularly on the game's coverage side of things? I know Colin's always recommended a degree in journalism, but does that really apply in 2017 with traditional games media and the state that it is and everything shifting to video game to video coverage instead of written articles and such?
