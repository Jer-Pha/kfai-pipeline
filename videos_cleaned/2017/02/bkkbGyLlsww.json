No, no, no, killing over layers over coffee, something we did. No, that was when Nick was talking about not driving. Well, coffee, just straight up coffee. We did it. Gamescast episode.

And that was a **** up flight to New York where there was like turbulence and issues. So like it delayed. I don't know. Did we? No, you did not go. I don't know. No, he'd be, you would know. There there's so often times in planes where I'm like, what's our orientation right now? 'Cause I'm feeling all types of ****, you know what I mean? But but then it's like 7 hours.

Their custom agent just has the **** hat that curls up on the right side and they're all dressed like Steve Irwin and they all got the hat on.

And so we're going to have to figure out like, now, are you aware of how hot it is, Sydney? Yes, it's summer right now, right? I got a, I got a tweet the other day telling me that it was this many degrees in Celsius and then they converted it for me. 106 degrees in Sydney right now. 106. 100 **** 6.

And then do have the roof parking, but that's annoying 'cause then there's the line to get out. Oh, man. Well, I bike over there, so I don't even know. I know I've seen the roof parking on that chest Park. I'm only bike parked there. Not many people biking at that Safeway. I guess I feel your guys's pain. My real food's closed. I know. Same thing.

Like, do you ever go to that Marina sub place at Fillmore? And I think it's at Fillmore. When I was sick and I totally forgot that they uh, that's the place. I went there and I was sick. I forgot they heat their subs. And I can't stand it because I put mayonnaise on it and there's nothing more disgusting to me than than hot mayonnaise. Anyway, but it's good if you ask for cold.
