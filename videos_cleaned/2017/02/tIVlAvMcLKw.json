Colin Moriarty. Dead. Dead. Yeah. Dead as a dog. Replaced by me. Tim Schafer. Tim Schafer. Yay! First time on the Gamescast. This is a big deal. Yeah. In the fancy place here with this thing in space. Tell me more. You are in the fancy studio. Where are we right now? Oh, in the snow? Right. Yeah. Now you can actually see the characters. It smells good here too. Now here's my question. You have a daughter. I do. She's young. Bring her into this. Great. I gotta get right to the, you know how, this is how I interview. I get right into it. I don't like where this is going. Yeah. It's a dark place. Oh, great. She's eight years old. I know. That's why this plays well. I'm thinking even when she was younger.

This is a question that's come up before on the Gamescast and or GameOverGreggy Show and or just in the car ride. Have you ever had to put your daughter in a bathtub full of ice? Because you said episode 108. I started thinking of a fever reference to make and then I remember that we've had this conversation before. At what temperature do you have to put a human being into an ice bath because their temperature is too high? I remember this happened. I'm like at 105 you can start convulsing and you have to go to the hospital. I was like 103. I think, I think she's been almost like 103. Did you ever, you put it in the ice? No, I never heard of that. Who has that much ice on hand? No. Is this the ALS Challenge thing? If I can drive to the store to get ice, I can drive her to a doctor.

You're not going to be able to find this on Google. So she said she needed a kidney. Right? Is this how the story starts? No. That was the thing that came into school. It was like, I was so sick this happened. They had to put me in and I was like, that sounds like a nightmare. That sounds like freaking out. I'm like, where'd your parents even get that much ice? It's too much ice. You can't even touch ice for that long before you, like it hurts. It kind of burns. I'm sure there was water in there too. I think about the athletes. We've all seen Ballers.

Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so here we have a video of Greg getting iced. Just scroll forward Kevin. Is the ice about to drop on us right now? Oh my God, look at our old shit. I remember that. That's what it used to be. Tim, you were in there. Should we talk about how that made it, the big thing that it actually did? What? They had some big breakthrough in ALS because of the Ice Bucket Challenge. Oh, did they? Yeah. No. It was because of this clip right here. This is the one that did it? This launched a million people?

When I think trendy and hip and cool, I think Tim Schafer. Yeah. Yeah. We, everyone in the studio is kind of curious about VR. We tried it and thought it could do cool stuff, but it did kind of make us a little sick. Like I'm the first person that gets really nauseous if anything moves wrong in VR. We're like, what could we do where you're like, you're not moving a lot and being sick. It's like, well, if you're in one location, how could you do anything interesting? It's like, well, if you had psychic powers, you could do a lot. You could lift things up, move them around and start to solve puzzles with them, set them on fire. That got us into this, you know",

All of a sudden, I'm in your head and I'm seeing the world from your point of view. Then you see him and you jump. That's how you navigate in the game is you jump from brain to brain. That's how we thought of that. I did the airplane level. Now I'll get back to that. Thank you. No problem. Don't count your chickens while they hatch on it. Maybe I'm going to turn on you here. No. That's one of the interesting things about you guys is the fact that you jumped in, jumped right into the swimming pool with Kinect. Now with VR, you're right out of the bat too.

We're like, we don't care about the new technology. Then someone's like, you know, with that new thing, you know what you could do? You could do this funny thing. I'm like, yeah, that's true. I love things that just potentially open up games to new people. Kinect was like, people who didn't like controllers could now play games. VR still has like, it's scary to put on the headset and you got to have a lot of, but if someone in your house has never played a game, kind of an amazing experience to be transported to a far away place, you know, like all those movies where they put them on their grandma and stuff like that.

The Happy Action Theater. Yes, thank you very much. And the Kinect Party. Right, right, right. Did you find, were those successes for you? Or did you guys feel those were successful in terms of Double Fine sales or Double Fine products? I would say two answers, no and no. No, but they actually, it was not, a lot of people have it now, but it didn't, it didn't there wasn't a big market for that when it first came out.

Even though it's probably fewer people have seen that than any of our other games. But like when you're playing that game at a party or like a kid's birthday party or like Thanksgiving and everyone from all different ages can get there and play this game and they're laughing much louder than they laugh when they play a normal game. They're not all introverted and serious about it. They're just like, it's a very joyful thing that we made. No, I agree with you because I remember that, Drew Murray, is that right?

How's it like to be back in the world of Psychonauts? It's been quite some time. It's been fun. I mean, really, you know, have a lot of affection for those characters because they were the first, you know, and they came to life, the actors who did The Voice were so close to us and getting them all back in the studio and a lot of the team back together, it's just like a little family reunion.

The first game had some seeds for these ideas that were going to be in the sequel and so we can plant things in the middle game. So it's like basically kind of working on them all simultaneously in a way. We're not working on the first one, but you know what I mean. Yeah. We can kind of weave these little things in there for people who are paying attention and they can see all these things. What I think is cool is with Double Fine, you guys have kind of, you know, you have your Psychonauts games, there's obviously like the Brutal Legends and all that stuff from the past and all the legacy stuff that you did many, many years ago that made you the legend that you are today.

It's a big fighting game, but it's like makes people laugh out loud. All the time. Yeah, yeah. So Headlander, what does that fall? This also has tons of character.

You know I mean I had that thing that happened with Notch actually probably is what started that in my head. I started thinking we'll never be able to go back to it.

People start to get really really gun shy about it. But there's some great games already. I really like Wayward Sky. Yeah I did play Wayward Sky. There's two things I love in VR. One is just the awe of big things. Like did you ever do that ad for the movie the walking across the World Trade Center? No I wanted to walk. I wanted to walk so bad. I was like I guess VR is kind of cool. And then I did this yeah it's called The Walk and it fades in and you're on the corner of the World Trade Center and you're supposed to walk.

But also I love little things in VR. You're cleaning your heads up to like little miniatures. Like in Wayward Sky she has this little like red scarf and you're something about it looking like a little doll. It's like really compelling. No for sure. The first time I had a VR moment with any of them was when we were still at IGN. I just had finished up at noon filming. It came out and sat down and put on I think it was Oculus 1.1 or whatever.

Well, I mean, this is the first time we've done this kind of through-way partnership. You know, we have a crowdfunding proportion and then Double Fine now has been around, has a back catalog and makes revenue. We have our own money, so we're putting in our own money. And then we have a publisher, Starbreeze, coming in to be our publishing partner.

It affects, it changes a lot of stuff. They want to really, like, make sure you do a lot of risk mitigation things and they want to have creative input and they want to change things. When you're asking for less money, you can kind of get away with, do a more creative sounding project. You know what I mean? Like, I saw after Brutal Legend, I was like, could we ever do another, it seems like to ask for that much money again to do another Brutal Legend type game, they would want you to take away, they'd be like, oh, that sounds great.

E3 is I have appointments to get to every time. The idea of 15,000 more people in there who might be milling about a bit more is off-putting to some people. When you're running between appointments, get out of my way. Which does happen every time. I'm late to every appointment at E3 and it's not because I scheduled them poorly, it's because I give myself a five minute window and then I'm getting stopped by someone I know, someone I don't know, somebody who wants a photo.

I don't know how you love E3? Do you still love E3? I mean yeah it's just when I found out I never I when I found out about E3 it was already a work thing. It was already",

And it is we always say it's like Christmas it's a Super Bowl. It's all true because it is hey here's all the information you need about all these awesome games but we don't need it anymore.

How long it takes everyone to wrap their head around that and realize that you could go to PAX and do that there. You could go to PAX and have hey we are Activision. Here's the Activision panel in the main PAX hall. And we're going to show you all these new trailers all these new exclusives. The place would go fucking wild and you would own that weekend. I think it's a step further than that. It's not even PAX. Just do your own thing. Like entirely do your own thing and make all the news about what you're doing. This is what I'm most concerned about.

They've counted out E3 before. Like it's been dead before. Oh it's dead. I saw the Gamecock funeral parade in Santa Monica sir. But the thing that I think is important to keep in mind is that E3 being dead E3 the show E3 what E3 means to all of us is different than what E3 actually is. E3 is just it's a convention that's three days or whatever but we count the press conferences in that. We count the entire week of an experience that people have.

Because we get more people to come. And then they go oh hey we should have the whole show. We should call it E3. And like it'll come back to life again because you get this critical mass where people could justify on their expense account flying all the way out from Europe or something until the because it's that big of a show.

Was the point I was trying to make is the fact that as E3 becomes more like a PAX it is going to be compared more and more to PAX. And that's what I'm saying is I think pound for pound this year in terms of a community focused show PAX is going to be better than E3. It's going to be more important more interesting more fan service-y. And so when what we're saying where it's like a couple of different people getting together like well yeah why wouldn't you if you're you know CD Projekt RED and you want to do Cyberpunk you know yeah that'd be a great E3 announcement.

I can meet with everybody. They're all going to be there. Yeah. And it's like that is the one thing that makes me think like Xbox couldn't just back out and just be like we're just doing our own event.

Great movie. I've always wanted Clancy Brown on the show. Rob Paulsen apparently mentioned it once but it didn't go anywhere. So thanks for nothing Rob Paulsen. So there's this family dynamic to it which I like. What I found really interesting that they mentioned in the character creator and I didn't think about what it would mean until I started playing later on and then got really excited about it was the fact that when they were going through Customizer they're like totally screwing around and putting crazy tattoos in the face and changing the hair to white and you can",

You get there you come out of cryosleep they start running you through everything. Your ship immediately gets into some havoc. You're bumped around things are going bad. You guys have to go to what you think what you hope is going to be your new home the new Earth or whatever.

This doesn't look like Earth at all. They're like uh that mountain's floating and like there's all these like rocks suspended in the air that they're dodging like in the earth. Exactly. Well sure. I don't know what that I don't remember that. Anyways though you know how Mass Effect as much as I loved it always felt very stiff.

It isn't the way it plays similar to if you remember from just the trailer I never actually watched or I did watch it but I forgot it all. Star Trek Beyond where they're falling in Kirk does the thing where he he grabs that lady's arm and they like teleport. Yeah. Same idea which is not a Mass Effect traditionally move or look where we're blown out the side and we're falling suddenly and I'm free falling in Mass Effect dodging crap we're screaming we're talking and then like you have your jump jet you're trying you're there you're hitting and like trying to stop yourself and like but what and some of this is cut scene.

It looks great and it's not a perspective from stiff Mass Effect I'm used to. And so once you get there and you get the controls that continues where it's like running feels way better. You still have the jet packs that you're able to shoot yourself you know make longer jumps hover with one of them. They eliminated cover in terms of how it used to be where it used to be that you look at something hit a you run and you slam up against it or whatever. Now it's all contextual.

You go to the research side you can take all the points from everything you've researched and then research how to make new shotguns new armor new everything.
