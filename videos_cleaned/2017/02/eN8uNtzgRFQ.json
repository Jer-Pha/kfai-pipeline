Lola's daddy Colin, there you go. And the pure one, Tim Gettys. I've been listening to R. Kelly's hit Ignition Remix, and once again, every time I hear it, it reminds me I never heard the original remix.

No, he didn't wear the Band-Aid, but he had a big poster of Nelly in his room. I don't think he did that. No, he did. He did. He bought the poster. It was in the room.
