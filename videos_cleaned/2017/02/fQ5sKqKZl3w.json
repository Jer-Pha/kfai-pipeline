Today we're going to be checking out Sniper Ghost Warrior 3. Colin, you you've played this before. Uh, so no, Sniper Ghost Warrior 3, we saw at the GameStop Expo. They came on stage and showed it to us, and I had never jumped into this franchise before, but it was super it I like my shooters. I like my I like my first-person perspectives. I like my gunplay. And having kind of, you know, we I love the Call of Duties. I love Battlefield, all those kinds of things. There's this whole other echelon, this whole other like kind of side niche of games that are way more actually hardcore in their gameplay that I haven't really messed around with. So when they came to GameStop Expo and showed it to us, I was super I was super enamored with it, and uh, I wanted to give it a go. And so here we are. Let's give it a shot. Let's start the game up. Now we're playing on a PC, but",

Let's play. Can you use a mouse and keyboard?\" I'm like, \"You know the answer.\" Indeed, you know the answer to that question. I did in my heart. I mean, it's not going to be very confident with a controller. You only imagine how incom it would be. Yeah, so Sniper Ghost Warrior, yes, for those that aren't familiar, you can play in the three different styles essentially. You don't get to be a Ghost, right? But it's pretty much saying, you know, you can be a Sniper and kind of stay back and do the long-distance thing. Ghost is more like the stealthy hiding stuff, and then Warrior running within assault rivals, right? Exactly. And so I mean, you know, when we were all",

And then no, they explain at GameStop Expo, no, it's just it's just a representation of the styles of gameplay. Like, oh, that's actually clever and made me more intrigued about the game cuz as much as I like to slink around, Mhm, I too like to open up the barrels as they said. No one actually has ever said that, but it's something that I like to do nonetheless. Yes, you've always came off as kind of the Ghost to me, you know, but I know you have the Inner Warrior. Yeah, I got the Inner Warrior. It got the Warrior Within, which I think is a book actually. The Warrior, The Warrior Within. It was also a Prince of Persia game.",

I can't hear very well cuz I have one headphone off here. Let's go and check it out. So with the sniper, when when you zoomed in, you can see all the different kind of sniper accoutrements, the different like elevation, the sniper levels, and the all the breathing, and you see the meters and stuff.

Well-placed shot. So you want me to do it? I'm good. Watch this. Can I shoot at my assault rifle? Aim for that thing. Oh, so I'm going to open the weapon wheel of the sniper rifle. There you go. An explosive bullets. All right, I'm going to explode this tree. Yeah, Timber. It's like a Pitbull song. This makes me a little nervous. I really is their mission worth this? I don't know. It's unclear what the the stakes are. Not as loud. See, change your ammo when the Ghost comes in. Right now, the explosive sniper bullets. That's a mix of Sniper and Warrior right there.

I love I love that. What are those little like the lens flares called? But when they're in real life, bad feeling, huh? Real life lens flares. There there's something. I'm sure wolves told you bad feeling. Believe me. Now you're right this time. Looks like they're busy chewing down something. No need to kill them until you really have to.

The color of the tags represent levels of the enemy alertness. Okay. All right, cool. Oh, there's more enemy detection. More avoiding detection. Got you. Go. So with the drone, you can kind of do the typical thing. You go up and kind of scout the area out before you sniped. Don't think so. I want I want to kill them, right? Something tells me you're going to end up killing them. Will he get mad at me if I do it? I don't want to do it. You asked me, Robert. I want to I want to build trust with Robert. God damn it, man.

It must be soldiers, army, mercenaries, scouts, judging by their. I like the vibe this game. Like, I don't know, man. Two bros around in the woods saving wolves. Saving. Yeah, Rob, man.

Punched him right in the back of his head. Did he punch him with a knife? I'm pretty sure I just just straight up jacked him right in the back of his head with no knife.

No one know no one look up. See, my question is, I wonder I'm I'm sure they do, but like, do they just have quieter drones than we're used to? Cuz we've seen a drone. It's been like a swarm of bees trying to attack. No, it's true. I feel like be really high up. Think about it. That's like 100 feet up. 00. Yeah, it's a building right there. Got the first one. That's a good point. I wonder what that building used to be. Subsidized housing. Jurassic Park right there. Subsidized housing. Is that what you think of? Perhaps that's true. That could be.

He's cruising for a bruising in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Use to set your scope elevation as close to your target's distance as possible. In this case, 300 meters. Got it. There we go. I mean, do you see that? So he's at like 68 meters up there. So over here, you got to change your elevation up to 300. Yeah, there we go. Yes.
