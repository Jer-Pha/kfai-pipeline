And keep your breath frozen till the city blows So we're in love We're in love all the time And we're still waiting Into the night Take my hand I'll never never leave We're in love We're in love We're in love Something's wrong something's like Maybe nothing's right It's the others away There's a wall in the ice Through the dark and the fire In the thick of the wind Secret world I'll never leave We're in love We're in love And the answer lies In the dark and the fire In the dark and the fire So don't leave my hand We're off to never never leave We're in love We're in love We're in love We're in love That was one of the fucking coolest things I've ever seen! I hope you had a lot of work! I did a great dream scene at the end from behind. That was so cool!",
