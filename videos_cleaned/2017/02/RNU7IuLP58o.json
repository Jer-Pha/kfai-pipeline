This is- No Taxation himself. You guys! Colin Moriarty. The most underrated duo of Kinda Funny. Looking like a broke down Sith. I like it. It brings out- the red kind of brings out your like hate. Looking like a broke down Sith Lord. No didn't quite make it. Dropped out of Sith school. Darth... Darth Taxis. Darth- Darth Taxation. Darth Misery. Yes. Darth Misery. Now... It's good to be here. I'm never on the show anymore. But... I'm still trying to figure out where- Like this was on my desk this morning. It's a real- Kevin can I have the one please? It's a real Make America Great Again hat. Now... It was on my desk this morning. Was it really? And I was like yeah. And then you gave it to me? Well I was like well...

Yeah where did it come from? I don't know but the funny thing- I assumed- I assumed that you got it and gave it to me as a practical joke. No I wouldn't do that. That's too expensive. Now... The funny thing about it is it says Made in China. Oh yeah. On the hat. But Kevin I was wondering you should probably put it on. I don't see why. And... Go ahead. It's a snap bag. No you should put it on. You should put it on. No no. I'm not gonna put this hat on. It'll match your little outfit. Your little Darth outfit. Ooh. That's weird though.

That would have been fucking awesome if you wore this in Australia. We definitely played the heel role in Australia and trumped it up a bit. I'll never forget seeing one of these for the first time.

It goes a little something like this. 30 contestants right? No one ever gets eliminated. They're all there for a month in a giant mansion. 30 contestants. And what's the goal? Who wins? I don't know. We'll figure that part out later. Maybe if you're coupled up by the end you get money. We'll have to figure out the semantics of it. But the concept is you start with one person right? The second person is that person's ex. The third person is the second person's ex. The fourth person and so on and so on. So everybody has at least one ex-boyfriend or girlfriend at least one.

One hundred million dollars a year. Good for him. He was making it.

There's this little game called Crash Bandicoot. I saw this. The Insane Trilogy. And there's been a big question of whether or not it's exclusive on the PlayStation 4 because when it was announced at E3 Shawn Layden was very kind of like vague about the wording.

Then there's been a lot of questions since like we haven't seen anything on the box art of exclusive on PlayStation. But nowadays that's not even necessary. Things like Nioh don't have that on the box art. We talked about this last week on the show. Yesterday PlayStation Ireland tweeted out.

Xbox One obviously. Nintendo Switch. Maybe. My theory is that it's not coming to Xbox One. It's coming to PC. But I just feel like there's something a little off about them revealing that at the PlayStation conference and then never saying anything about it. Well they revealed it at E3 at PlayStation's conference. But then at PSX they showed the first gameplay of it. Right. But the thing is Crash has been on every console for a long time now.

It'll sell more which is good news for the franchise. But what's interesting is there's been cases like this before like with GoldenEye. When they did the GoldenEye remake it was everywhere. Yeah that came to PS3. Yeah. So there's things like that. And also with Activision in particular with Diablo 3 they also did this weird vague wording of not mentioning it was coming to other consoles. But it did come to Xbox One.

My question about the GoldenEye thing was all I remember about GoldenEye by the way about the GoldenEye remake is that when we were at E3 one year one of the people on the video team at IGN broke the embargo. No one knew what the game existed. We actually leaked it. That's what I remember about that the most. But wasn't it on Wii first and then it bombed on Wii? So I wonder if it was only ported because it didn't reach sales figures. Random story about that that I'm probably breaking some idea but it probably doesn't matter because it's old. But before I even worked at IGN I used to do video game focus testing like focus room stuff. And I went to downtown SF. We all sat in a room. A bunch of people in the mic. I'd be very interested in how much these guys know about the history of games or anything. They start describing a game and I'm like they're talking about GoldenEye.

At least part of the IMAX footage The Last Jedi was shot on location in Ireland presumably on the island of Skellig Michael for the first Jedi Temple scenes involving Luke and glimpsed briefly at the end of The Force Awakens.

Steam subsequently removed Digital Homicide's games from the platform citing the company's hostility to Steam customers. Thankfully Digital Homicide's case didn't make it very far. Sterling told me the agreement to dismiss the case was exactly the result he'd hoped for although after a year of this he's pretty tired. What's particularly disturbing about lawsuits like this is that even in cases where they're clearly frivolous as this was they can force critics to spend significant amounts of money on legal defenses.

No I understand that. But they're spending all of their product. They were saying they spent half of their gross revenue on hardware. Which means that it's like what Uber does. It's actually there are two major companies that have been doing this for a long time. Uber and Amazon have been intentionally losing money for different reasons.

And that eventually when they run out of money the hope is that they have the car just pulling up with no one. And they have no one to pay. Then it's all going to be revenue-based or revenue-backed for them. Because the interesting thing about Uber this is getting really nerdy but I think 80% of the money goes to the drivers on a gross fare. So $0 $16 that would go to the driver.

They don't want to listen to anything else. But if you want more of the rock sound and that reggae sound you can go to Sublime or Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their DNA especially with Chili Peppers.

Drew Scanlon is the newest one. What's he doing? He didn't say he's going off on his own. He says is this a symptom of San Francisco's pricey cost? Maybe. I think it has more in line with the fact that traditional games media is dying and people are going off to do their own things. And I think that's great. So the next evolution. One day what we do will be dead too. That's the way it goes. We'll be doing something different. Yep. I'll be on the up and up. Do you think it'll involve lightsabers?

The last Zelda that sold actually extraordinarily well was 19 years ago. It was Ocarina of Time. And actually Majora's Mask sold pretty well too. But like Twilight Princess did fine. That's in like the 8 million region I think. But actually Skyward Sword I think got outsold by Uncharted 3 like to 1. So it's not like a huge surprise there.

I do feel like it deserves more than an 88. 88's high but this game I feel deserves at least a 9 on that or a 90 on that scale. Zelda I don't know Zelda's hard with Metacritic because there's so much baggage that goes into reviewing a Zelda game I think in both ways.

It's also a response I think design-wise to western role-playing games. So I think now you're going to be able to now you have to compare it to these games. And I don't know that Zelda can stand toe-to-toe with The Witcher 3 and stand toe-to-toe with Horizon. I just don't know that it's possible. But we'll see. We've got to judge it based on it's going to have its own unique charm. There's no doubt about it.
