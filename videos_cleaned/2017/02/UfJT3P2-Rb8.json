You can leave questions for us over at KindaFunny.com/Gamescast topic, just like my dude Super Cerberus did. Super Cerberus, hey Greg Miller, I guess that's the three of us together. Yeah, I'm curious, what are your most controversial gaming opinions? You know, the thoughts you have that no one else seems to agree with. For instance, I believe that Super Mario 3D World and Land are better than Super Mario Galaxy. Yeah, that's right. Thanks, Super Cerberus. I, I, I do not agree with you. Super Mario Galaxy is in a league of its own, but I, I do agree that Mario 3D World and Land are vastly underrated, um, when compared to the other Mario games. I think that they are, specifically World, is fantastic. I'd say that game's close to a 10, whereas Galaxy, and specifically Galaxy, are undeniable 10. The personal opinions, huh?

Just make it sure, just make it sure, just make it sure. Undeniable fact, not an opinion. Uh, my controversial opinions, it, it's weird because as I've done more and more things with you guys, it's, you, you kind of warp my sense of, uh, what everyone thinks because I feel like there's the internet, there's my friends, and then there's like when I have conversations with both of you. So I feel like my answers might not, uh, be correct for the widespread thing. But Metal Gear Solid 4 and Zelda: Twilight Princess. Twilight Princess, taking aside the first 5 hours, which admittedly are garbage, and the tutorial f***ing sucks, there's something about like that generation in games, like in around then, where many games had tutorials that weren't",

There's something about like that generation in games, like in around then, where many games had tutorials that weren't real tutorials. They were just kind of like long intro sections that had nothing to do with the rest of the game. Kingdom Hearts is another victim of this. Um, but I thought Twilight Princess, uh, was amazing and I, I really loved it. And it was just kind of an easy copycat of Ocarina of Time, but I feel like that was the point and I feel like they succeeded in that way. And I think that a lot of people look back on it and now, especially with the Wii U re-release, it's kind of like being looked at a bit more positively, I think, than it was in the like 2007 to 2009 era where everybody was just like, well, Zelda is just more of the same every time. Um, I thought has the best Zelda. It has some of the best dungeons in the entire franchise and I think that alone is what I kind of remember back on and and think",

Um, uh, topping off the the dungeon where you use the Sky Hooks and you have like the Spider-Man style things and you're fighting the big ass, um, bird and going from Tower to Tower. Like it, that to me felt more Zelda than most of the things in Wind Waker, which I also think is a classic. But I think Twilight Princess really kind of nailed what I love about Zelda. And then Metal Gear Solid 4 gets a lot of hate just because it's super convoluted and it's like Kojima just being like, I'm going all f***ing in. I'm answer your question. You know what happened to Meryl? She's marrying the guy who shits the f***ing s*** joke character and we're going all in on that storyline, by the way.

Like I think the whole thing was such a good, um, love letter to fans of the series. And it like, I often think about replaying that game and I think if there was an HD re-release at some point, I would love to jump back in. But, uh, Metal Gear Solid 4 gets a lot of hate. And like on the internet, this is one of those things where like people are, oh, f*** that. Like three and the rest of them are so much better. It's like, I don't know, man. I think they're all so good in their own ways. But four, as an experience, technically it was HD, just to saving the comments from PS3 game, just throwing it out there.

Uh, I do believe in my heart of hearts that games overall, pound-for-pound, were better 20 years ago than they are now. Um, and I'm not saying that there aren't games that are better today than there were then. What I'm saying is that if you take the volume of games that were available on say, uh, in say 1994, across NES, Genesis, and SNES, the volume of games that were available there, then you take the volume of games that are available now on PC, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, pound for pound, per capita, there are more better games than than there are now.

It will never be beaten, um, in terms of the way a game feels, the way the game plays, the way the game plays out, the perfect length of the game, the exploration of the game, the nonlinearity of the game, everything about it, perfect. Um, and that's okay. It's like saying, uh, it's not going to get better than Thriller. It's not going to get better than Sgt. Pepper. It's not, so that's okay. You know, it's, it's, it's a total equip thing. It's not going to get better than certain books that came out 50 years ago or whatever. It's not going to get better than Bradbury or better than, you know, whatever. It's the same thing.

Look at all the s*** now that comes out. I'm not saying that there wasn't s*** then. I'm saying there's way more s*** now than there was then. Uh, so that's number one. Number two, uh, I think GameCube is better than PS2. Uh, this is a, this is a unpopular thing. I think PlayStation 2 is the worst PlayStation console, which is another one of my, one of the most unpopular things that people have said. I think GameCube is woefully underrated, uh, has a woefully underrated and underplayed catalog of exclusive games, um, and also has a vast third, uh, party library that I don't think people really even realize was ever there. Um, GameCube, uh, was a dominant console in my life during that, that, during that era. Um, and I know it was for lots of other people, but",

Um, and I know it was for lots of other people, but not too many. Uh, only sold, sold fewer than 25 million units. So, um, so there's that as well. Uh, and, uh, and then I'll say that my favorite PlayStation console all time, PS3. And that's another unpopular thing as well, because a lot, for a lot of people, it's PS2. I would go PS3, PS1, PS4, or PS2 in terms of the order of the main console. Where you put PSP? Uh, probably after PS2. You know, like I love PSP. I love them all. I think they're all great. But, uh, I think the PS3 is, was a great console. So I, those are the things that came to mind where I'd say those kinds of things and people would think that I was crazy. I've said many, many times, I think Super Mario Sunshine is better than Mario 64. I stand by that completely.

Um, but, uh, yeah, so those are the things that I think are unpopular gaming opinions that people will have problems with. It's the beauty of it is that there is no objective truth about any of these things. Um, but, uh, and a lot of people think I have rose-colored glasses about the past or nostalgic glasses. But no, it's, it's, we're not talking about when we're talking about like the early 90s, we're not talking about 1979. You know what I mean? Like we're game, like you go back and play a 2600 game, those games are bad. There's a few of them that are good. But like, go back and play Adventure or something like that and tell me that that game's fun. It's not.

Those games are f***ing awesome. Uh, Link to the Past, um, for some people, you know, Phantasy Star or Phantasy Star IV, Final Fantasy VI, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger. These are all amazing games. Um, and and a great time for us to have been alive and cognizant of those games because I was so f***ing in it by the early 90s. So, so those are my opinions. Metal Gear Solid 3 is overrated. Agreed. Half-Life is boring, one and two. Uh, I, it's recent, but the PlayStation Pro, hey, come on now. Why are we talking about this? Uh, Mass Effect, the original one, boring as well.

Why death threats? What are we talking about? Come on now. It was a fine ending. That's how it ended. Where you, what did you think it was going to happen? You don't get mad at Telltale endings. You get mad at this one. Come on, guys. Come on now. Uh, jet fuel can't melt steel beams. And then, uh, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is the best Metal Gear. Peace Walker is the best Metal. There you go. There you go. Those are good. I like that. Good question, Super Cerberus. Super Cerberus, meat cake.

Do most video game releases fail? That would be like classifying all the games that didn't suck to you as in failures. This depends on the game. I, I, I think that, um, the Final Fantasy XIII apologists, for instance, that are out there, it's like, guys, it's not okay that you have to play it for 30 or 40 hours up. After 40 hours, though, that's not acceptable to. But a game like, um, there are games that if I had abandoned them a half an hour, and I would have been disappointed. Uh, but I also think Wolfenstein's a great, a great example. Resident Evil is another great example. The, uh, new, the new one, Seven. I think that there is this weird, it's not a popular thing.

Uh, and I think that's total nonsense. Your time is more valuable than any of these video games. And if you don't feel like you're spending your time wisely, whether or not the game's critically acclaimed or not, uh, then then you move on. You, who, you, what are you trying to prove to anyone? So it's a game by game basis. For instance, I played The Last Guardian for an hour and I was like, nope. And that game will never be seen again in my library. You know, like, and but some people swear by it. So there is no, there is no right or wrong here. It's just to say that like, for me, that was plenty of time to know that I was, I was begrudgingly going to go through that game and probably hate it and probably hate it",

There though, did the game fail then? Like, do you think The Last Guardian failed? It failed for me. Uh, but I never expected that it was going to be good anyway. So, so it for me, so it's, it's one of those things. There's this, there's this notion in, um, in game design, uh, it's called by many different names, but like, time to fire, um, is, is a, is a thing that you, you know, in other words, the player wants to play. So how long until that's why Wolfenstein failed in this regard? Uh, we're talking about, uh, The New Order, which is a, which is a great f***ing game. But if you play just the first half an hour of it, it sucks. It sucks.

But the person who only gave it 15 minutes is like, f*** this, and walked away forever, is not necessarily wrong to do that. It's their f***ing life, you know? Who, who are we to say, you know, you should have given it more time or you're not a real gamer because you, you know, I've been reading a lot about Final Fantasy XV lately. Kotaku posts about it. And it's so funny reading about this game because there, it's all over the map how people feel about this game. Like wildly all over the spectrum. I think it's fine. I think it's a fine game.

Chapter 13 seems like it's towards the end. But if you got to Chapter 13 and you're like, this sucks, man, I don't want to do this anymore, and you walk away from it, that's totally valid.

I am at the very end of the game, like the very end, and I just don't even care anymore. And it's not a reflection on the game. I think the game's fantastic. What a fantastic game that was. It's just like, I don't, I look at it in my library. I look at the trophies. I'm like, I don't, I don't care.

What, what's in my mind right now as I'm playing Berseria is like, I kind of want to play a shooter. But, you know, two points anyway, piggybacking off what you're saying, I think is the fact that, um, for people like, I love Final Fantasy, but XIII sucks and the ending sucks. I think that's just what we talk about all the time is that negative criticism is the criticism we lob the most. I think you can't disassociate the 30, 40 hours you put into Final that you loved and then the one bad chapter in the ending that was weak. It's similar to like when I, we did the Inside review and I sat down and I was like, when we, I'm like, man, that ending was, and that's where I started. I was like, I can't believe that ending.

And that's still how I talk about it now. I talk about how great and it's f***ing perfect in terms of gameplay and pacing and all these different things. And then I think this actually speaks to, uh, a topic that we did on the GameOverGreggy Show, I do believe, uh, recently, or it was just a conversation with Nick. I talk to Nick too much. But talking about the difference between, uh, Amazon Instant and Netflix for me, where Amazon Instant, I go in, I look at the new movies, I go through and I'll take a chance on a cast I like. I'll give them my money and then I'll watch that movie. Whereas on Netflix, when it's free, I'll jump into it and if I don't like it in the 5 seconds, I bounce.",

And I think where it comes down to the people who see things through the end that they're not feeling in the first 30 minutes or whatever, they've invested their money. They, you know, you can trade it in, but you can't necessarily return it back in the store, or it's digital and you just own it. And it's that thing. But for us, it's always like, cool, I'm going to try this, not in the mood for this, and I have 50 other games I want to try. And I want to find what speaks to me on this moment kind of thing. Yeah, it's a very fair point. Yeah, yeah. I think for me, the the failure thing is not so much the the am I invested and and do I want to play it at the the exact moment that I'm doing?

But like Star Fox Zero, uh, for example, comes to mind. Like I, I feel like if it comes down to the difference between having criticisms of something and it failing to me are if I still want to defend the thing, right? Like have criticisms of Final Fantasy XV, but I'm defensive of it, which I think at the end of the day means I do really like this thing. And I think with Star Fox Zero is I don't defend that, uh, even though I want to, you know? And I feel like the criticisms I have, that game failed to me because it, uh, didn't give me enough good to latch on to to be like, despite the bad stuff, I still really like it.

The most I can say about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is at least the soundtrack was good. And that's all I had. And that's not enough to outweigh everything else about that game. They have Good Charlotte on that soundtrack. They did not have Good Charlotte on any Tony Hawk soundtrack.
