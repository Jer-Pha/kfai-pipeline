Now Ray Bert says, are the conferences open? All in one word, no. No, they are not. Now, as you know, Xbox and Sony usually what they do is they, you know, have part of it line up, get in earlier, get it through this access. There's ways to get in, incredibly limited. They are not open. Uh, the, they are not, passes are not open, or I mean, conferences are not open in terms of what normally happens. They would have said that here as well.

Yeah, I mean, if correct me if I'm wrong, Gamescom is open to the public. Gamescom, yeah, yeah. But they do it where it's one day's press and the other public. Are they doing that with this at all? Apparently not. Apparently no. This is just going to be everybody in there at once. So that's going to be, that's going to be difficult. This is, this is one of those things that makes me glad we're not games press anymore. Um, and that it makes it a little bit hard to sort of, I would imagine, cast the wide net to try to cover everything at the show when there's going to be that many people there.

It's going to be a very, very interesting show in terms of how they handle it. And then what happens, the scuttlebutt I saw today was obviously the excitement of fans being able to come to E3. You've always wanted to go to E3, but you're never in the press or development before. Here you go, it's a shot. Uh, press in general being split between, oh my **** God, more people, and this is a cool thing and a way to keep, uh, E3 around, seeing as how most conventions are like this. The industry only conventions have been dying for quite, quite a while.

It's like, first off, anytime you hear us ever talk about something cool we saw, usually behind closed doors, not like when you go to the Warner Bros. Booth. Sure, there's games all around it, but there's a giant media desk check-in that then takes you back into this room. There, I think what this is going to lead to is more booths that are **** walled fortresses where you walk in and it's like, hey, oh, you don't have an appointment?

You're not going to walk up and play Uncharted 5 or something to that effect. You know what I mean? Whatever they're going to announce. I, I doubt there's going to be a kiosk for Detroit or something to that effect. Detroit would be behind closed doors. They'd give you a guided demo or something of that effect. Um, so it's going to, but then, then it gets into, is E3 taking this on themselves to evolve what the show is? Is the ESA sitting there going like, we need to think about the fans? Because I saw Trevor Starkey tweeted, you know, he's like, he's excited about it, this, that and the other.

If the way I'm picturing it happening is you are going to go there and be the lowest person on the totem pole. E3 is there, and this is what I'm, E3's been in my decade here. E3 is there to sell games to the press and to the media to go sell to their audience. I don't think most places are going to take it on themselves to say, well, we need to appeal to the consumer.

Yeah, we need a private PlayStation theater that we line kids up at and again, only get 50 of them in every 30, 45 minutes and have them come through and see the Horizon Zero Dawn demo or, you know what I mean, the demo for our latest, greatest game behind closed doors while just like the presses or something to that effect.
