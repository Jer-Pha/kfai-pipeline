I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer slash seducer, Nick Scarpino. What's this shirt? This is a Death Eater shirt. Got this in London when I went and saw the Harry Potter. How am I just seeing it now? You've seen it once before. Really? Yeah. Really? It's a girl pass shirt. Yeah. I don't remember it. They redesigned the Death Eater logo for that show and this is it. And it's why did they do that? That seems like a 17. It goes along with the whole the art direction for the whole show.

I was in Australia. I see. So you put out a tweet or something. They're moving away. The governor of Connecticut wrote a letter to the ownership saying that they can move there. If they want to Hartford, the Whalers go to the Whalers, the hometown. I don't think that's going to happen.

So assuming that there's some back end deal where they're going to leave. So there's all sorts of things in play right now. And I don't know what's going to happen. What happens if they go and become the Whalers again? They're not going to come if they go there. Hartford, the Whalers? It's a weird kind of thing because if they move to Quebec or to Kansas City or something, I'm done with the NHL and I'm done with the Islanders.

But they have a great tradition in that town for hockey and they're a miserable fan base too. So it'd be funny to move the Islanders there, have them become the Hartford Islanders or something like that. Because Hartford's not that far from the water. And then we can combine the two miserable fan bases in the one. And we would get the Brass Bonanza, which is still the best goal song and sports and hockey song.

They don't have any tradition there except for that song. So we could just take that song, put a little Hartford patch on the Islanders jerseys. I remember when I busted that out one day and you're like, wow, how do you know that song? I was just from NHL 93-94. But it was just... I don't remember being only attached to them in that game. I think the organist just everywhere pointed. I was like, whatever, here's the fucking root. Yeah, it was a big deal in NHL 94 because obviously there's very limited space.

We're coming to San Francisco. They're getting further and further west. The San Francisco Islanders. How would that sit with you? What would happen if they came to California?

We've talked about this. Juju LeBeau is one of the great all-time NHL players. French Canadian player, Juju LeBeau. Great goal scorer. Really soft hands. The thing about sports fandom that we've talked about in the past is that sports fandom is supposed to be, in my mind and in the minds of many, an association to where you are from. You know, I always got mystified when someone's like, I'm from Cleveland and I'm a big Blue Jays fan. How the fuck is that possible? You went to California, I grew up as a Yankees fan?

But generally, so like it would be weird for me to, like I don't, I associate with the teams that are from where I'm from. I have no interest in any other teams. Everyone's always like, oh who you're rooting for tonight? I'm like, if the Jets aren't playing, I don't give a fuck who wins. You know, I root against certain teams, of course. So if they moved... Part of that's got to be though, just the fact that you were raised with good East Coast values. You were brought up in the world of sports.

He advocates for a white homeland, for a dispossessed white race, and calls for peaceful ethnic cleansing to halt the deconstruction of European culture.

      "text": "Richard Spencer was punched on Friday during an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation near President Donald Trump's inauguration, tying the Australian topic, of course, back to this. Video posted online by the outlet shows the white supremacists speaking to Washington Bureau chief Zoe Daniel when he was interrupted by individuals off-camera. Spencer was answering questions on whether he was a Neo-Nazi. He said he was not and was then asked what the Pepe the Frog pin was he was wearing, signified. Pepe the Frog is an internet meme so often used by racists and anti-Semites it was designated a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League. As Spencer was speaking, a masked individual ran up, socked him in the face and fled. Spencer left, later tweeting there was no serious damage. So basically that's what happened. So those are the two things. Now what ended up resulting from this is Pepe's dead now. Pepe's gone. The Nazis got up and... Maybe because you think at some point",

The question I want to pose to you guys is, was it right that he was assaulted? And is this kind of... This seems like some people are trying to make this the new norm, that political violence is now going to be the answer as we move into 2017 here.

There's a small contingent of white supremacists in the United States, and I want to reiterate that the white supremacy, like proper white supremacy movement in the United States is very small.

Someone getting through 5150 in a cabinet position is really strange. For the record, there are only nine cabinet positions or cabinet appointments in American history that were voted down. Nine. So it's not a common thing. So for someone to even pass by one vote by the vice president having to break the tie is unprecedented.",

Shout out to the 3430 for XFL that I watched that you recorded that cut off the last half an hour of it. I have no idea how",

You know how you finish the superheroes and then they pop the thing up after the credits? The ending is Vince sitting down with that guy who helped found it I forget his name from NBC and I'm talking about like would you ever do it again? He's like yeah. And they start talking about how they would do it again. Like we have to get Jerry Jones involved. Oh my God. Totally make the XFL again. Anyway. Yeah I don't know.

That's the thing with the Super Bowl is an event unlike any other right? Like that is the American event of the year. It's the Super Bowl of Super Bowls very well said. But I mean like there is no other like the Super Bowl halftime show is probably the most money put into one performance that anyone can do. It always looks awkward. It always looks awkward as hell. The only thing that's awkward about it is that there's a bunch of people that are clearly paid to be there that are dressed just like Lady Gaga and they're just having the best time on the planet. You can tell they're not real fans. Maybe some of them are real fans but they're clearly been cast. I think I",

I think I remember Paul McCartney's not being bad and I think it's just because he played music. The Chili Peppers were good until you found out that they weren't even playing. Yeah you're running around the bass guitar nothing plugged into it. Yeah I don't know. I guess this is the thing even as a casual music fan it usually insults me because it's just like play the music. Can I hear the music? I mean that kind of show. Bruce Springsteen did a good one that was just again playing music. Man you don't like fun. I just don't understand. That's the whole thing of it. You want music go watch music.

I think she's interesting and talented. Left Shark. Left Shark had a great Supermills. One of my biggest celebrity crushes possible. But I also think it lasts too long. I have a huge problem with the Super Bowl as it is. We did a conversation with Colin about this a long time ago. It should be about the game. It seems like it's about everything else. That's fine because there's so many casual fans and so many passersby around the world and in the United States that watch this.

That was a good one. Yeah I remember watching that in my dorm room. I'm being like whoa. It's kind of crazy. The Super Bowl is like E3 for movies though. And I think that's why I get in. There's a whole bunch of movie trailers. It's like the only time a year that you just get here's a new trailer here's a new trailer here's a new trailer. You know you're looking forward to it. It's like oh I think we're going to get a new fast trailer. I think we're going to get a new whatever Marvel movie or all that shit. As I said the commercials are great.

And the game would have had other shitty commercials otherwise and would have some other like what do they do for halftime shows and normal games? Do they just not show shit? If it's an NFL? If it's just a normal game. Like during the championship games and stuff they might have a band play but they don't even show it. Do a normal game? Yeah. If you're watching a televised NFL game and it's halftime they'll kick back to the studio to talk about what they've seen. They'll recap that. They'll talk about other games. College games would have like there's marching band that comes out and the golden girls will do the number and stuff like that. Marching. That's the thing. They suck in college too.",
