Some of you know us. Thank you very much. I of course matter the least today. You are here for Hideo Kojima, the definitive interview. No pressure for me. Don't worry. I got this. My journey to this stage begins in the spring of 2000. I was a late adopter to the PlayStation 1 and bought it for WWF SmackDown. And me and my friend Bo went to Blockbuster Video and decided we were gonna rent some games. And we got Army Men: Sarge's Heroes on the PlayStation 1 and Metal Gear Solid on the PlayStation 1. Oh, you've heard of it. You've heard of Metal Gear Solid? Obviously, we went home, played about 15 minutes of Army Men and said, wow, that was a bad purchase, and then instead popped in Metal Gear, played it the entire night, ranted and raved about it, passed the controller back and forth. And for me, it set me on the path",

And for me, it set me on the path that leads here. I knew video games were more than just colorful diversions. They could tell a story. They could mean something. They could resonate with me. And I remember going to school the next day and talking to our friend Camps and saying, gosh, this game was amazing at Camps going, I know. And what about that Psycho Mantis fight? Do you remember this fight? And I went, yeah, of course. Oh, man. The controller rumbling, the memory card it's reading. He's like, yeah. And when the screen made it look like you were going to your inputs, and it said Hideo. And I said, yeah, is that a Japanese TV publisher? And he's like, what? No, it's Hideo Kojima. It's the guy who made the game. He's made this entire universe. And in that moment, I learned about Hideo Kojima, and I didn't realize how",

So I couldn't be more excited today to sit down and talk to him. I'm excited to share this with you. Please, are you excited? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the man you already know and love, Hideo Kojima. Now, I didn't say it earlier because there was a lot of information to pack in. So I'm going to give him a round of applause for his translator, James. Please sit down. So, Hideo Kojima, hello. Hello. I want to start with what's happening right now in your career, your life. Death Stranding. I've been paying attention. You've been putting out great trailers. You've been putting out great teases. Death Stranding",

I've been working on it for a long time. I've been working on it for a long time. I've been working on it for a long time. So we released two trailers so far, one at E3 and one at The Game Awards at the end of last year. And everyone tells me they don't know what the game is about. I think that the most important hint is that we're going to have to look at the trailer. And I think that the game is going to be a little different. But I would like you to take a closer look at both of the trailers to look for various hints that are hidden within there. Trying to find the hints within the trailers is part of the game, and it's already begun. Do you guys want to watch the trailers",

That'll explain everything according to Hideo Kojima. Can we roll the two trailers, please? So now we all understand Death Stranding, right? No more questions about Death Stranding? Got it. Great. Has anyone pointed out to you that if you line the trailers up, the baby goes from one trailer to another trailer? God damn! Here's the thing, Hideo, that I love. Since... I've been following you a long time. Since the announcement of Death Stranding and the deal with PlayStation and all this stuff, you've done more interviews than I think I've ever seen you do for any of your games coming up.

It's my intention that I'm giving people lots of hints. Yeah, dude. It's going to be a long two hours, folks. Trap in. When you do talk about this game, what do you feel comfortable saying?

So, the main theme of the game is connections?

However, one thing that has not changed in this time is the basic game mechanic that the player holds a weapon, in this case a stick, in order to push back adversaries in their way. And with the introduction of online, that has kind of transferred into a game mechanic where people take that same fight using weapons or, again, a stick, to fight against each other, push back at each other, or team up in co-op to take down a stronger enemy. This type of game mechanic has not changed very much. So, what do you feel about the game mechanic? What do you feel about the game mechanic? What do you feel about the game mechanic? I think the game mechanic is very different from the other game. It's not that it's a game mechanic, but it's a game mechanic. The game mechanic is very different from the other game.

The game mechanic is very different from the other game. So, as you may know, the first invention that man had was basically using a stick as a weapon, as portrayed in the movie 2001. They use a bone as a stick. Historically accurate. The second invention was the rope. As opposed to the stick, the rope, which pushes adversaries away, holds them back, the rope is meant to bring them in, pull things in closer, also make connections. So, the theme of Death Stranding is the strands, as you saw in the trailer, there's connected to kind of like a belly button, that kind of strand, this kind of connection is what I wanted to show you. So, the idea of the rope is to make connections. So, open world, third person shooter, got it. Interesting. I think that the game is very different from the first one.

So, the first one is the game that you make. So, once you make an open world game, you can't stop. All other games after that aren't as exciting, so I needed to make this game an open world. And it's an open world game, and please expect a large degree of freedom. You can do almost whatever you want within that world. The second one is the high-end game, the shooter, the action game. I feel that people who are used to playing high games on high-end equipment, high-end consoles, triple-A games, shooters, and things like that, they'll be very used to this game, very intuitive for them, very easy to get into it.

So, I just want to make up the point that it's not a game about using ropes to tie people up. You can do whatever you want. Like I said, it's familiar for people who are playing shooters as well. But everybody you've shown so far has someone or something tethered to them. Are you sure it's not a game about ropes? I think it's a game about using a gun. If you use a gun, you can't use a gun. Has there been a concern or conversation internally about are we showing too much too early?

We've had a good response. We're really happy for that. And a lot of people are wondering about the content of the trailers, too, as we were talking. And we're really happy for that reaction as well. There are pieces to the puzzle within the teaser. So if you can put it together, you'll get a more complete vision of what it is. But nobody's done that quite yet so far. Damn.

The pressure pushes us forward. cultural they have a pro pre-rendered with method on they break with this stuff the game Falco hell directions to where hatred unstrue my sit down a so he's a trailer such Most of the trailers that you see in that regard in our studio is that they outsource it. They hire an independent studio to create the trailer. Lots of times it's CG. But we actually create it using the same staff that make the game. And I direct the content of it. I do all the camera directions and all those things like that. So that's a big difference between ourselves and the other big studios. You talk about the pressure, the reaction.

That makes sense. So you show it to them. They give you feedback. It puts a pressure on your team to make the game better, your vision, all these different things. Right now in the life cycle, the timeline of Death Stranding, where are we? Like are you in what you would call pre-production? Is the game playable in some fashion or is it just still an idea? Is it coming out tomorrow? Is that no? So as you may know, we acquired a game engine from Guerrilla Games called the Decima Engine. And last year we were running multiple tests using that engine.

But we need to create something different from Horizon. If we made the same type of game as Horizon, it's not good for either of us. It wouldn't be particularly good for them either. And we're leaning towards a photorealistic aspect. So we needed to spend a lot of time figuring out how to adapt that engine towards the photorealistic elements of our game, as well as the type of game that we wanted to create using the engine. The second trailer that you just saw is running on that same engine, but obviously it looks much different. It's very photorealistic. So we had to basically adjust and tune or change a lot of the tools under the hood of the engine. So when we make these changes to the engine, we send them back to Guerrilla Games.

Because when we originally got the engine from them, it was just our intent just to get it, just to use it for ourselves. But they said, no, we want to work on it together. So that's when we decided to change the name to the Decima Engine. And so now we have basically two different companies working to improve this engine at twice the speed. So at this point, the game is moving on the Decima Engine. It is open world. You can see very far into the distance. And we're working on the game logic as well. We're also doing various tests on the different systems within the game, the game systems. But we've generally worked out the framework for the game. So this year",

And then along came Xevious and it's scrolled and like the background looked like the earth and the players and enemies were all different and they all had their own names and they all had their own world settings I was very very kind of pleasantly surprised by this.

And so we were able to implement you know when you go underneath the desk the perspective changes when you go up against the wall the camera loops around in front of you and you can see behind you these type of things. So in essence this Metal Gear Solid that I created then is almost a reboot. I took the idea from the original Metal Gear and rebooted it for the PlayStation 1. I feel like we've just gotten to the core of you where it makes so much sense why you're always obsessed with new technology.

So Hideo when you think about yourself as a game maker do you think about yourself as telling a story or do you think about yourself as making and pushing technology further? Because again Death Stranding we start off here talking about the technology the new engine but even here you bring up the fact that you know Metal Gear Solid on PlayStation you can change perspective do all those different things. I think of Peace Walker where okay now we're using co-op and we're pinging Wi-Fi as we go.

Do you see story being your strength or do you see gameplay and technology? In a word both. I like the push story and everything. Yeah so games have the power to surpass movies and novels and their dramatic representation. I like to incorporate the new technology in order to push the envelope to get new types of emotions from the people who are playing the games. That said you're talking about how for Metal Gear Solid that was your vision for Metal Gear Solid what you saw for the original version.

So people ask me that a lot but I've actually never created a game where I had an idea that I wanted like I gave up on an idea and then saved it for next game and put it in that one instead. So every time I make a game I put everything into it that I can so that when it comes out eventually it will be something that I won't regret at all. I've never had a chance to make a sequel for the game that I'm creating now. It's always trying to make a complete game a complete product in the one that I'm working on at the moment.

So I just want to share an example. So say there's this band and they release a new CD and it's a hit all over the world. So then they make their second album. So the easiest thing for them is to create another album with the same sound. No one will complain. But if they don't do that the band makes no progress and the audience makes no progress and in fact there's no actual reason to buy the second album. So to be honest an album is harder than an album.

But that's okay because it's going to accelerate them to a new level and it'll take their fan base to a new level. That's the kind of thing they pursue with the games as well.

If there's a movie director an actor an actress or a novelist somebody that I'm really interested in I make a concerted effort to actually go meet them in person. So I'm doing this kind of thing all the time. So I wanted to use Norman Reedus in my game and the normal way to go about that is to go through an agency kind of have an indirect connection or",

So I wanted to get his personal contact information. So Norman Reedus was in some movies in the past Mimic as well as Blade and the director of these movies is Guillermo del Toro. I'm a friend with Guillermo del Toro so when I met him I asked him for Norman Reedus' contact information. He said Norman I'm going to meet you at the game. I asked him for Norman's contact information. He said Norman I'm going to meet you at the game. I said I'm going to meet you at the game. So I went through the first step.

You saw games as what you could do in Japan and here you are you know 31 years later on the other side of this looking glass where you've created all of this work this body of work these games that influence the people who are in the movies and in TV and doing all these different things now.

He's a very heavy gamer like a very hardcore gamer. First off it's hard to like having a text communications via mail and that for a while and then he came to Japan and that was the When I met him for the first time but it didn't really feel like he came to Japan for work I didn't really feel like I had it was the first time I met him because we have been talking to each other so much We share so many things in common or likes we like many of the same types of things are very similar So you can't get this After that you know whenever I went to LA I would",

Colin said it would never happen. Just saying. When I first started going independent I thought I wanted Norman Reedus to be the hero in my game. So from the get-go he was the person I had in mind. So last year when I spoke to Norman about this Norman Reedus about this usually when you're dealing with somebody in Hollywood you can't make an offer to them without having a lot of detail. We had the story for the game the plot for the game decided or I had it decided but it didn't have the other details.

When I talked to Guillermo del Toro and said Norman Reedus is in the game when I talked to Guillermo del Toro and told him that Norman Reedus was in the game he kind of had this kind of sad face like he was being left out. He looked kind of sad so he said well do you want to be in the game too? And he said yes please. You're a good man you're bros I like that. You guys are like the group from Final Fantasy XV.

I played a little bit of VR the other day at the office. I get sick very easily from 3D graphics. I became a little sick. So I started playing Res instead. Res is the greatest. Res is fantastic.
