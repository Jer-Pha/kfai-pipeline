True story. Cool, Greg. Yeah, used to be obsessed with Nelly. Weren't we all really obsessed with Nelly to the point that he had a don't tell me he wore the Band-Aid. No, he didn't wear the Band-Aid, but he had a big poster of Nelly in his room. I don't think he did that. No, he did. He did. He bought the poster. It was in room. What he didn't do is what I did, which was take that poster and put it above on the roof so it looks at him when he's sleeping, and he left it there. Why not?

So I was like, I'll take a little break, and then started working IGN not too long after that. We did this thing.

To which I came in the next day to work, sent told Nick these quotes. He said, I'm going to watch it that night. I get home alone. Colin, I know he's working on. Colin was right. I know how stressful it is to edit. I know he's on a tight turnaround. I I get a text from Colin. This is killing me. And I'm like, oh, shit. Here we go. He's the wheels have come off.",
