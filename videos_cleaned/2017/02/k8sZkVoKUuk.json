Welcome to The GameOverGreggy Show. I'm one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer, seducer, Nick Scarpino. Hair is on point today, Greg. Thank you very much. Yours as well. Here's the things. I like that you're wearing the Beat Cop shirt. I like you're still rolling the sleeves. Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about the coconut oil in the coffee. Yeah, it's a little weird. It is overpowering and I'm like, where are the Mountain Bars? Who's eating the mountains? No, it's coconut and the coffee. Yeah, but but the fun thing is, yeah, it's there. You might be able to see a little bit of it. Can you? Careful, it's hot. Um, no, you can't really make it out. So, uh, you have to be careful with the coconut",

So, uh, you have to be careful with the coconut oil. As as a lot of you know, I'm I'm flirting with the the ketogenic diet. One of the things I recommend is getting healthy fats, one being MCT oil. Uh, what you can get is you can get these coconut oil packets, uh, that you put in your coffee and instead of a creamer, so you're not getting dairy. The problem is in a cup of coffee this big, they give you a packet that's literally the size of a hot sauce container. If you pour the whole thing in, the first inch of your coffee will just be oil and I almost gagged the other day. This is approximately like a quarter of the container. Now I gotta ask too, is this making you poop like really the liquidy poops?

No, that's that's not the problem. The problem is the poop's too solid when you do only protein. Like I said before, remember I said it's like pushing a ****. It's like pushing peanut butter through a thimble. It's just it's just disgusting. It's like you gotta just scrape it out, just scrape it out. And this is the Tauntaun Master, Colin Moriarty.

Last week on The GameOverGreggy Show, we did the topic where, hey, let's go through his policies. He just got elected and see what we agree with and what we don't agree with. We recorded that on Tuesday and then by the end of the week, everything was on fire and he the immigration thing had happened. The executive order, people were freaking out. And then it's like every day you wake up and look at the news and something else crazy has **** happened and people are getting fired. Sean Spicer saying all sorts of crazy ****, tweeting his passwords. Maybe nobody knows what's happening. You got banned over there. People call him president.

The they got inaugurated and then it would rolled out through the week. I wanted to do this topic of how long will he be president? And I think all of them we were hot on the trigger finger for each one of them because he could be I I can see him being president for eight full years. I can see him not being president by the time this posts. I don't know what's going on. I can see him being president for three terms because he doesn't **** care about rules.

So as upset as we are all are that again, our political um leanings, that's just that showing. And it's the same the echo chamber that everyone always was talking about. It's just a slightly bigger echo chamber now because um some of these things even the people that voted for him don't agree with them, whatever. So yeah, you're still dealing with that. But at the end of the day, like this is a thing that is happening and it's happening, people. This is our president. The president of America is causing these things to happen.

I honestly think that it's going to take someone trying to kill him to stop him from being president. I think I think eight years. You think eight years? Yeah, I think at least four, eight years. I don't I think that what you're seeing right now is him making good on all the quote unquote promises that he had. Um, as far as the Muslim ban, I mean, there's already courts overturning that.

What I think he's really doing is I think he's smartly um uh just absolutely pandering to his base. He's he's all those people that got elected. He's saying, look, I'm doing all these things that you want me to do. Whether or not they're lasting, I don't think he cares.

We've chosen to follow people who believe what we believe. And so often times you have to be very careful and not think, hey, everyone in the world believes this. How come this is happening? When in reality, it's just all friends in video games journalism that tend to skew very liberal, uh, who are saying these are outrageous. Whether or not they're right is a different story. I happen to agree with a lot of what people are saying as far as the liberal slant. Um, I don't agree with the ban. I think it's completely and totally unconstitutional and completely un-American.

Someone Twitter made something a really good comment where they were saying, you cannot it's not about trying to change the Trump supporters' minds anymore. That's gone. Those people are now solidified and and and being Trump followers for the rest of their lives. Now it's about getting those people who don't give a **** to actually care. Um, and that's what kind of that's why I'm glad we're talking about this and that's why I'm glad there are celebrities out there that are saying, you know, this is un-American and people are actually having the balls to go out there to airports and protest, um, because that's what people need to see and",

Um, I don't have the information to even come close to starting to begin to understand that. Um, but it is it it seems it does seem scarier than it than it was when say like Bush took over, right? Or and what's crazy about that is you look at the things that Bush did. Um, you let's take the immigrant ban for a second, right? You look at the countries that everyone I'm sure saw the the chart that came out that said all seven of the countries that that people are banned from coming aren't countries that Trump does business in.

And that makes you scared and that makes you think, well, you know, maybe we do need to see this guy's tax returns because maybe there's some outrageous **** happening there. And then you think back to the days before social media when we decided to start a war in Iraq to go get weapons of mass destruction that weren't there. And then but but I don't remember people being that outraged about that back then. And and then, you know, George W. Bush just keeps on going being president.

And that's it's not a good thing, but at least I still care. And I can't remember the last time a president got elected where I was still talking about them even a week after they got elected, right? Even Obama, everyone's like, cool, we got Obama, great. Let's all just go back to work. Everything's going to be okay. We trust this guy. But at least with Trump, you're like, I don't trust this guy.

Uh, only 35% of Americans don't. So while I'm not saying anyone's right or wrong, this goes to speak to the fact that even with all that's all the bad **** that's in this ban, because I think some of these guys I read a couple other polls that were that backed that up as well. There wasn't quite that that much majority, but it was 48 to I think 30 or something like that, right?

When you talk about anything with politics now, which is I'm trying to reclaim that ground as best as I can with the things that I write and the way I tweet and the way I talk about politics.

I'm like, what are you talking about? And they weren't watching the content. It was just the fact that we had a Trump thing.

Everything Donald Trump does bad. And I just don't agree. So like I don't think he's a good man. I don't think he's fit for office. I didn't vote for him in the primary. I didn't vote for him in the general election. I vote for people that I think are capable and I don't think he's capable. But there he is. And so we could have honest discussions about the good things and the bad things that happen out of this and the fitness of the people that he puts in the in the place. I think Sean Spicer, for instance, is just not a good press secretary. I can't imagine he's going to last more than a few more months. You need",

There's people that are there for years because they know what the **** they're doing. This guy has no idea what he's doing. So all these kinds of things are important and they're worth talking about. The major thing and as so many things are going through my mind with this particular thing, what I encourage people to do is to just look at the policies and attack them. And this is what I've been saying for months. Attacking the man's not going to work. It's not going to work. It's still not working and it won't work. Look at the polling, right?

Like, is this productive? Like, is what he looks like matter? Like, is that is that something that matters or is it what he's doing that matters?
