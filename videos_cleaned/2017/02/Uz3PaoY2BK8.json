We might have talked about it tangentially with like, talked about like hoarders and things like that, but I don't think we've talked about collecting things before. I just want to talk about like, what have you guys collected? What do you collect anything currently still to this day? Right for me, I I mean, I've talked many times about like, I collect music, physical, physical. Oh, also my Fast & Furious steelbook collection. Bring, thank you. Um, I've collected Disney movies on on Blu-ray. Um, I've collected Pok\u00e9mon cards and a lot of, you know, Yu-Gi-Oh! and all that type stuff right in front so that they know, oh my God, they scratch these steelbooks, they scratch.

I I have a lot of lists, but I over the years, I've been really kind of OCD about organizing my digital files and making sure that everything is how it should be. You were stoked about this for the plane ride. Yeah, no, and I organized a living **** out of things. It was great. But that that stuff's more organizing lists and documents, notes that I've I've made over the years. But when it comes to music and movies, and I mean, even pictures to an extent, but I really like knowing that I have it all. And streaming services have kind of like changed the game of that a bit.

Um, but yeah, I'm just kind of interested to see what you guys have collected over the years because for me, like back in the day, I definitely was into collecting video games and like, I I like that, but it reached a point where I was like, I need to stop. Sure. And there's been so many things in recent times where I'm like, I cannot buy a physical comic book 'cause then I'm done. Sure. I'm going to buy too many, you know. I can't buy an Amiibo. I can't like, I never really liked Funko Pops, so like, I'm not too into that. But action figures, like cool action fig, you still have a problem with Funko Pops as well. I do not have a Funko Pop problem. Have you know, they're kind of lame, aren't they though? They're all the same. I like them. That's why they're cool. It's like having a Dr. Look how good",

They can touch, they can hold hands. A Wolverine bobblehead. Bobble H can't get. They're all the same. No, see, that was the thing when Funko Pops hit, that was the that was one of those gut check moments for old Greg Miller of, okay, this can either take over my life or I can establish rules. And so the rule became, of course, I'll buy any Superman. And then, of course, any House of El character. I'll get a Super, I'll get I'll get a Superboy, you know what I mean? Come on, Guess Bo, you know what I mean? And then every version of Superman. Didn't buy the new Dark Knight. They got the, you know, the Dark Knight Returns Superman out there. No, thank you.

Of course, I love Batgirl, so I had to get the, you know, I got the I got the original Batgirl they put out. Now I got in there, I got the Batgirl uh B Batgirl Burnside where they redesigned the body and gave her more of a female figure, which they have for the Animated Series Batgirl, which I haven't bought and I'm probably not going to. I'm going to hold off on that one. But it's the same thing where those were the rules. I'm not going outside of that. Now you might say at my house, I have the two Batman Funko Pops. I do.

And the old days, I would have been there because growing up, of course, I was a collector. I I had a problem and I was a I was a um only child, so I was spoiled rotten and there was no big brother to say no and my parents didn't know any better, so they continued to spoil me like crazy.

And then when I was like, can we get two so I can keep one mint on card? Nobody said no **** way, grow up. So that's why in my Dad's attic right now, there are long box on top of long boxes that are one filled with comics and then filled with action figures mint on card. And I'm talking the Superman: Man of Steel collection. I'm talking Total Justice. I see these **** on shelves when we go to Comic-Con selling for $3. I the '90s toys are are largely worthless.

But I want to give a it's another one of those things where it's like, we know it's not worth our time to do that necessarily. Like, I don't like when when are we going to get the time to do that? When we call that time? But I can't bear to like throw them out because there is that you should never throw them out. Well, the G.I. Joes, I probably will never throw out.

I'm lucky I was so addicted to to having them all and having them lined up and there's something satisfying about it, right? And like when I I time investment, when I when I moved for the first time, like we had to get rid of **** and like it sucked 'cause like those they took up so much space and were so heavy. And like, I remember going through and I was like, you know what? I'm going to look at every single one and if it has some resonance with me where I'm like, I remember this issue, I'm just going to keep it.

I the exact same way of I had them all on a bookshelf, you know, all my EGMs, all my Game Pros or whatever. And I say the only one I ever kept was uh the EGM that's the one the PlayStation the giant one, the blue one that I'd read in. Exactly, exactly. But I regret now, you know, I don't know why I never kept the GamePro. That was the Death and Return of Superman one with Maximum Carnage on the inside that launched my, you know, wanting to do this.

But it was more than just the music, it was like all the Collector's Editions, T-shirts. Anytime they put out a T-shirt, I bought it. And like that, it wasn't until recently that I've kind of fallen off. Like if he put **** out, I'll still get it. But like some of the artist, I'm like, I'm not going to get every **** T-shirt you put out. But it makes me think like, are there people out there that buy every single thing we put out and collect? Yeah, the Kinda Funny stuff. 'Cause it's like, that scares me. It's awesome. Thank you. Like, oh, it's it's amazing, but it's scary to think that like, you're like that for somebody.

I don't think of what we do is collecting, you know what I mean? Uh, but I don't know. Do you do you and we appreciate it. I think on the the video game magazine front, I I almost went down that road because I used to be I used to love NextGen magazine when it had that matte cover and I was like, this so unique and cool. And I collected I like I the first one I bought, I forget what was on the cover, but I was like, this, I'm going to read this whole thing.

That was always a heartbreaker. You get there, the magazine covers ripped like ****. Hated hated the concept. And I still hate this. This still kind of uh uh chaps my height a little bit with the American Cinematographer Magazine that they put the **** label on and sometimes it's upside down, you know, and sometimes it's just like ripped off a little bit. And I'm like, and I love I mean, and there's there's also something nostalgic about walking into like a newsstand or magazine store and seeing it and picking out the copy that you want.

But then NextGen magazine screwed me over when they I guess it was probably an economics thing where they just they switched over from the matte cover to like more glossy cover. And I was like, you lost me. You lost me. Didn't realize till later, Doug Perry wrote for that magazine. Wow. Yeah, no, I mean, I'm right there with you. That was my whole thing with comics for a long time is that once I kicked the comic comic habit when I was going, I guess, out of high school into college. Like, I think is when I stopped collecting comics. And then in college, when you just the poor college student going to the University Bookstore and just taking them off the thing and reading them there and then putting them back, right?

I'd fall off the wagon like once every seven months, go there and buy a whole bunch of stuff that I wanted to read. But then I'd come home and just have loose issues and I would pick force myself to pick them up and throw them away or recycle them or give them away. I was like, I can't have these here because I know what this leads to. And I'm not buying a short box. I'm am not having a cardboard box here. And that's it's hard to it's it seems to me like it was just yesterday, but I remember those days of tweeting at DC Comics and be like, you need to go day and day digital.

And I think back to when I was collecting comics and filling those long boxes. And I don't know what it is about being a kid that gets you into that frame. And it's it's social, I guess. You're talking to people, you're interacting with your friend. I mean, me, my friends, you know, would get into the collecting cards. I remember Terminator 2, the first uh cards I ever collected, like trading cards were Terminator 2. And I remember when I got that last card, I traded Matt Noel to get the last card I needed and having that complete set. And like that sense of like, I did something. And it's",

Remember my Dad walking around Chicago Comic-Con, which would be going to become Wizard World or whatever. And I remember once seeing they had the platinum edition of The Death of Superman up there.

There's a bunch of books I've read like halfway through. Yeah, you don't want. And which I would never do. And and um the second thing is I I really have carefully seriously thought where I'm like, I'm going to spend a couple thousand dollars and literally buy all of these books physically 'cause I can't stand the fact that I have this **** collection, another collection of **** that's just stuck in time, just like the DVDs, just like the CDs, just like the the video games, just like the and so these",

Like my iPhone, I look through a lot actually on airplanes. I like to go through through and curate my collection. Smart. No, it's smart to do because I have 400 pictures of dogs. It's the thing of everything when I stopped taking when I got my first digital camera in college and started from that point, all those photos are either trapped in Photobucket or now on my PS3 'cause that was the only media server I had.

Very nostalgic to see. But the point I mean, when Ramone came on the show and showed all those pictures from college that were digital photos, whatever, I was like, this is cool. But and it was it was very nostalgic episode. But I I just I like",
