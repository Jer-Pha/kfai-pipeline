Um, having said that, the sex scenes are fucking fantastic. Are they? Because the first ones, the ones in the first movie did not really, they stepped it up. They really stepped it up. Um, well, that's good. I'll be honest, here's the thing. Did you ever see The Fall with Jamie Dornan? No. Jamie Dornan is a good-looking guy. Oh, the dude, yeah, yeah, yeah.

So it was so, so much buildup to the sex that when it happened, it was kind of like, that's it. Whereas this one, at least throughout the movie, like they realized, okay, we can't let people get too bored. Let's just keep throwing, you know, in between every Kim Basinger scene, we need to make sure we get some sex right now. Do they, do they like whip each other in this one or is it just nasty sex?

And I find fascinating in that, you know, in in the original John Wick, there's a bunch of like, basically there's all these factions of assassins and different types of like criminal organizations that he like this underbelly world that no one knows about, um, that he taps into because he's like the baddest killer on the fucking planet.

Um, some cool things went live today over on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. The definitive interview of Hideo Kojima with Greg Miller. Kev, are you asleep at the wheel right now? No, there we go. That's Greg. It was at RTX Sydney. He went out on stage. He talked a bit and then bam, Kojima was there. It was glorious. It was fantastic. Greg talks to him for hella long. How long is that? Like two hours? Hour and 43 minutes. Hour 43 minutes. Keep in mind, there's a translator, so it like really kind of slows everything down a bit. Like an hour and super interesting interview. They talk a lot about Death Stranding and uh, where it's at and in the timeline. They talk about Kojima's kind of production style. Um, you were there for this. Now I was. Yeah, yeah. I was. I was in the front row. Very cool. Was in a little VIP section. Fantastic, which felt really good. Although",

Kevin, second class citizen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyways, check it out. Show it some love. Uh, so many people clamor for the old school Greg Miller up at noon style interviews and stuff. And this was one of the best ones he's ever done. Great. Greg really did a good job. Did he touch Kojima's knee? No, it was too far. He did hug him at some point. That's nice. Yeah, Greg had this weird thing he did that we always made fun of where he would just arrange, he would just reach over and touch people's knees. Really creepy. Yeah, specifically. Um, um, all right, everyone. I know a lot of people live in the fucking Central Time Zone. It was a joke. Jesus Christ. It's Texas for Christ's sake.",
