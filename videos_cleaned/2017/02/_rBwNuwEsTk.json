Don't talk that way about Vita. You know, we've had up to with buttons than the damn thing.

I want to make sure at least the office has a copy. Of course, whoever I don't care if it's me or you, whatever. We don't need more than one. Well, the thing about it is like we had this conversation. So all three of us have pre-ordered our Switches. Today we got the Switch from Nintendo. So depending on if you or I take this and play with it, that'll become our Switch. And then the Switch we get that becomes the office. And the Switches can have different profiles on them.

And then I got an email with someone like that looks like someone was trying to get uh like was trying to get that name or or asked for like a lost password thing. That did you read the email? 'Cause it might have been a fan trying to help you. 'Cause I got an email of a fan trying to help me and he helped me. It said, did he really help? Oh yeah, yesterday. I thought you were all offended. He didn't help. Well, I was worried, but then I I I managed to get them to connect the email. The email said, you know, blah blah blah, click this link.

And then when I started Super Mario Run, it was like log in. And it was like I did that. And it's like, hey, do you want to make your account name or whatever? And I was like, okay. So I made GameOverGreggy. And then this week it broke as people are starting to get ready for this that yeah, Mario 64 helping the people out there. Okay, so this almost happened to you. You had your Nintendo ID. So there is, you know, the the old there's the Nintendo Network ID, right? Which is used for the Wii U and 3DS stuff.

So you had your Nintendo nickname. But that those are things you can just change anytime. Okay, change the name anytime, buddy. I know. I saw that. I retweeted Kaiser's. So now there's the Nintendo account, which is going forward what we're doing now. Also, there's the My Nintendo account, which is the old thing like back in the Wii/DS days. That has been going up till now. Now that's the one I used to get hats for. I claim my points on. You get all Platinum Points and all that. A getting goofy ass **** all the time.

Yes, he was like, 'cause I know there's going to be some **** out there trying to **** you over. Yeah, so like what happened with Pok\u00e9mon Go? 'Cause before Nintendo had the **** all figured out. And so what happened is you were able to switch it over and bring it in. Was a really nice dude. Emailed me and like just he was like, here's the 10 password. You can change it. And like, here's your name. But what worried me is that I had my own account already. I just didn't have a username. I just had the nickname and the Nintendo Network ID. So then I had this other account. I had to figure out a way to link them. Did you do it? Yeah, I did.

I'm not trying to look like I'm playing with some toy or whatever. I don't want to deal with that. But when you give Tim Gettys the option to have obnoxious blue, I'm in. I'm **** in.

Why didn't you just like I did with the Wii U and the Wii, why don't you get it for wedding wedding gift? Buy him one a Nintendo Switch. I don't know. We'll see. He's only getting married.

And I was super sold on the game just because it's gorgeous and it looks very fun. It looks like like my type of game from an aesthetic point of view. It looks like the opposite type of game that I'd like to play from a gameplay point of view. Open world. Here's a bu bunch of **** to do. Here's a way too many side quests and all that type of stuff.

The voice acting. All the things that like I care about from a AAA experience as an exclusive game. I'm like, all right, cool. I'm sold on this. Started playing it.

Like I like a lot of things about it, but it just it does not speak to me um in the way that I like to play games and the amount of time I want to put into something and what I get out of it.

And I **** love this game because it can play like a AAA linear experience if you want it to. And that's not even to say I don't enjoy the side quests when I do them. I just feel like they take away from what I'm I'm trying to get from this game. And I can imagine they they're great world building for the people that are looking for that. But it immediately changed. So I'm like, holy ****, this game's great. The story elements, the pacing, the pacing of just playing the main quest is fantastic, right?

So I'm like, kudos to them for for keeping that level of quality and polish. I think if there's one thing I could say about this game is that it's polished 100%. Like it is very, very, very technically impressive. Um, and just it's fun. It's fun to play. That's that's huge. I I didn't think there'd be as much of a focus on melee if you wanted there to be, which I do. I like play that way. And it's especially since I'm not um super leveled up, 'cause I don't grind at all. Um, facing some of the the the more boss fighty uh like monsters is challenging in a way that I'm like, this is what I like. I like this. It reminds me more of we talked how I wanted the more Zelda style experience for an open world game. And I started getting that.

So that's going to be a whole thing. But like, I'm having such a great time. I'm definitely going to beat this game. And it's it's it's going to be up there for me for Game of the Year. Oh yeah. I think I mean, granted, we're in February, but I think you can easily see. I mean, like, I think we're going to have some stellar games this year.
