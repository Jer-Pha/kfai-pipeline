The watchmakers' goal is to change the way consumers think about fashion by offering high-quality minimalist products at revolutionary prices. With over 500,000 watches sold to customers in over 160 countries around the world, MVMT Watches has solidified itself as the world's fastest growing watch company. That's right, MVMT Watches, MVMT. Greg Miller has had his sexy, you know, the sexy one with the red hands and the black face, and it's look good. MVMT Watches started just $95. At a department store, you're looking at $400 or $500 bucks, they're expensive. MVMT figured out that by selling online, they were able to cut out the middleman, retail markup, all that stuff, providing the best possible price.

Good job, guys. Greg, what have you been playing? Well, Nick, yes, Greg, I feel like not one, yeah, but both hands tied behind my back 'cause I'm playing some games and they're embargoed, so I can't talk about them at all. Okay. Uh, what I can talk about is the stuff we played, yeah, going to Australia. So that's why I brought in my Vita so I could run through my trophies. But where I'd want to start, big Tim Gettys, yes, you going to buy one? Is it, am I selling you on it by touching that? You touching the nub right there. Play this, tell if I like it or not.

Yeah, my game of RTX Sydney. Think of the Children. We were doing the, uh, one of the Let's Plays panel, Let's Play, Let's Play panels. We've done a bunch, Australian Indie Let's Play panel, right? And so it was like basically round robin. They brought out a bunch of different quick indie games. I want, we'll talk about Death Squared as well. We can all talk to that because we have a Let's Play up on it and we played more of it there. But I digress, back to Think of the Children. We didn't get any primer on what these games were until we sat down to play them. Think of the Children is, and Nick, now I need you to come back and listen 'cause it's going to be a game for you.

Think of the Children, but it, indie game, Australian indie game. Yeah, we played it on PC. The idea is that you and a partner, I don't know how many players it is, but we played in teams of two, right? Didn't we? Yeah, two, yeah, yeah. And so it was that there's two adults and then a gaggle of children and you need to stop these children from being murdered or abducted or drowning or like, there's all these different things where like the, the level I played was we were running around a playground and as soon as the level starts, all the kids are in the center and then they run off to the sides.

Kevin, see if you can get me, um, more information on this. I should have done research, sorry. Uh, like platforms released at that kind of thing. Uh, but it's timed. And so how many can you save? How many, what score, high score can you get? The kids start and then they run. So yeah, they run into the streets. Child Protective Services runs up and tries to get them. And like, you can run and grab them one by one and bring them back. You can run and scream, which will scare them off. Like you see a little radius of your thing run out, so then they go off and different things. Oh, there it goes right there. And this is, yeah, this is level I played. You got a barbecue grill on fire. You can barbecue and give them burgers to up your score. Uh, they'll run into the pool and drown themselves. They'll, they'll, they'll suffocate in the sandbox.

We did a Let's Play of it a long time ago where pretty much there's a lot of **** going on and you just need to kind of keep your eyes on everything at once. It looked like a lot of fun. There was a level where you're on a beach and you also needed to like take care of Grandpa. He was getting over sunburned and like the sun was just, he'd light on fire and then seagulls would attack one of the kids and you have to like go. It was, it's insanity. Jesus. What I like about it, exactly what I like about it, uh, the Party Hard comparison is a good, a good one, I think, in the fact that for me with Party Hard, Party Hard was very much take it at your leisure, let's see what happens, similar to Hitman.

Doing it where it's you, all, all of us working together, or I assume going against each other, or doing how we did where it was teams of two, we played in, set a high score, can you beat that score? That is going to be the Let's Play, I think, for us of, all right, cool, everybody jumping and play by yourself and let's see, or we break it into teams and go through and see you can do that and see, you know, who can be the best at saving all these kids. But it was funny, it was fast. It's, it's a one of those games that you get in and out of and I, I really feel like the more we play it, the more other people play it, you'll come up with the strategies, you'll come up with the ideals, you'll be there to, you know, actually have a strategy for",

Most of it's like, it's Steam, we're working on. That's how indies are. Yeah, you know what I mean? You figure the, the PlayStation and Xbox team's probably still reaching out and talk to these people. Of course. Wait, go back. Wait, hold on. Yeah, go all the way back, all the way back.

And if you haven't seen the Let's Play, you're indiv, you're different box, different colored boxes. Uh, there's lasers that get introduced. When you move on some levels, you'll move a certain thing, somebody else will move, they'll move a certain things. So you have to get dropped in these areas and figured out on how to do it. You were smiling. Remember, bodyguard, body, body, body, body. It kind of reminds me of like a isometric Portal, yeah, with four players and you all have to work together to, to kind of, uh, goal. Every level has like a different gimmick to it and the gimmicks start adding on top of each other, similar to how Portal would do. You're all trying to get to your colored square, which then",

There's a co-op mode you can do with two players, four players, party mode. You can play it by yourself, but then you control all of them, which looks really confusing or sounds really confusing. We didn't see in action when we did it. Uh, but I'm super stoked for that game. Looking forward to that thing. Uh, that is a PlayStation game, obviously. That is a Steam game as well, right? Yeah. Okay. I don't think Xbox. Do you remember? I don't remember. Kevin, look up, uh, Death Squared and give me the rundown on platforms and release down on that too. Thank you very much.

I mean, because what it is is, you know, usually how it works for Let's Plays, people hit me up and then I look at their game and say if we'll do it or not or if we have time or whatever. And when I saw that a co-op puzzle game does is usually a no, we're not those kind of guys. But to jump in and actually watch the trailer, see people dying, I could immediately see us **** with each other, which is immediately what happened. And then it became really quickly. Kevin wanted to lead and be the general and he's ordering things around, not understanding things, killing us all. What do you got for me? PS4, Xbox One, Steam. There we go.

Uh, there was another game that, that you played during that called Adventure Pals. Yeah. Can you, what it's called? I think so. Can you get, can you Google that, Kev? YouTube it. Adventure Pals. Could remember if it's Adventure Pals or Buddies. I'm pretty sure it was Adventure Pals. I believe you 'cause I kept having to say it over and over. That's true. You did have to do more work on it. This is the one that was like we were playing Boss Rush mode or whatever, a bunch of bosses. So Kevin's looking up what Adventure Pals is, if that's the name of it. Um, that is what it is.

I didn't get to play it. It just looked great. It was just chaos and hitting things or whatever. It was like, whatever. It's got a great art style. And again, we were playing Boss Rush mode, so maybe the gameplay will be fine on its own. But just running up into tagging trees, I wasn't feeling it. So like, 2D platformer with a super cool art style. I'm trying to see if we can get a better clip of like a boss or something. Can you, can you scroll forward? Oh, that was, I don't know what's happening. I can't control the video. Oh, okay. The video is in out of control. It controls us now. See like that's, that stuff we didn't do.

Uh, then I'm thinking, now I'm walking the show floor in my head. Mhm. I'm walking through the mental version of the show floor. There's one more game. Oh, from the indie game. Yeah, you're going to pee and nuts. Yeah, don't, do not bring nuts back here and eat nuts on this show. All right. You can come back and you can eat nuts off camera on the side and stare at me. You cannot. Don't. Why you, you could have easily not crossed in front of the camera. There's another game called Goat Punks that I played on the second day. There's no, you didn't.

Um, and it's essentially like you're these goats jumping up the, uh, a mountain and you just kind of spin around. It's like a platformer and whoever gets the top can drop bombs down below to **** up everybody else and they fall down and you just got to get to the top and hold the top for a certain amount of seconds, then you win. It was utter chaos. It looked like a lot of fun. Definitely sold on that one. Okay, now exiting the stage, you and I went to a little booth called Nintendo. Wow. Do you remember that? Oh, I do.

And they're like, hey, in between the panels, we need you guys occasionally to go do interstitials where they bring the streaming crew to us. We talk at a booth for 5, 10 minutes. Like, all right, no big deal. We'll do that. No problem. You and I go to the Nintendo Booth, unsure of what we will see, unsure of what games we will play. Will it be Zelda?

Kevin, not you. There'll be 28 mini-games in 1-2-Switch. Okay. When it comes out. Um, and the games have weird names like, so there's Quick Draw, that which I played against Hideo Kojima. Yes.

And so it showed the trajectory of the bullet never getting into a hit zone, which I thought was a cool little thing. So this, this game is much deeper than people credit for. But it's, I mean, yeah, it's, you know, it's a 1-2-Switch game. And but it is a 1-2-Switch game that I could actually see. Well, so that's, that's the thing about the 1-2-Switch. I am not defending this as if this is the killer app that everybody, you know, should be excited for. The fact that it's even $40, I think is, is that how much it is? It's 40 bucks.

I got to play the Joy-Con Rotation, which is the one where there's the box, you have to guess how many balls are in the, oh no, that's Ball Count. There's a game called Ball Count. So I guess that's the one I played where you rotate the controller and you have to guess many balls are, uh, in it.

Yeah, well, you've had a lifetime of practice. Exactly. So usually it's no more than two. But yeah, well, Alfredo and Kevin are over. I guess you're right. All right. Exactly. Uh, what else was there, Greg? There was, we played the Samurai game. Well, that's the one I wanted to, the title. That's where you're starting. Is that we went over Samurai Training, Samurai Trainer. And now this one I had never seen before either. Uh, and the way this one works is again, we're both standing side by side, TV and silhouettes behind us. Uh, have the Joy-Con. And then you switch off. It randomly picks the first one.

And so he's, he's holding the sword and I'm like this with the, with my Joy-Con. So it's like, boom. And I'm supposed to like catch the sword. Exactly. Exactly. Wouldn't work in real Samurai world.
