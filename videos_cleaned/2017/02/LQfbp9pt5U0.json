It's Thursday already. Here's a question I I have that I've always wanted to ask you. Are you close enough to uh Mr. Kojima to call him Hideo? I do. So you when you when you see him across you see him across the the crowd, you go, well, I don't I mean, I don't like I don't say like I'm falling off a cliff. How you doing? Good to see you. No, Kojima is gonna be his own topic today. Oh, so save it. Is he save for that top? Yeah, let's save. Is Nick here the whole time? The whole show? Oh my God. Yeah, I'm sorry.

We're not talking about Hideo yet. I good. It was later. That's topic three. Uh, recently, I just finished Inside. I played Journey and now I'm playing Hitman. So you finally did B-jump? Yeah, yeah. I don't know why. I think I I just I've I've always liked Hitman as a series. Um, traditionally, I've played that game the complete polar opposite of how you're supposed to play it. I think the last time I played was either Hitman 2 or Hitman Blood Money. I think it was Hitman 2, which I think was on PS2. I want to say that was the last time I actually went through it.

And they used to rate you and I would get rated like psychopath. Yeah. And like Diana would come on and be like, hey, FYI, not the way you're supposed to play this game, Agent 47. Um, but I'm digging it. If you guys haven't played it, you should give it a chance. It's a it's a like if if you like Hitman, if you're a fan of the series, this is like the best. Here here's the thing though, is I don't I what's been interesting about Hitman is that everybody who sees it and goes, oh, that looks interesting and plays it seems to fall in love with it.

Like she's super in love with it. What about it speaks to you that grabs you like that? 'Cause you're not, you know, we're joking around, but you're not the video game guy that we are that wants to go home and plays all these different things. Yeah, I just I really like the style of it, honestly. I like the I like the uh the the music in it is fantastic. It really drag like pulls you into the environment.

Does it be because I've I've played the demo at a few events, I think, and I I have the retail version. I just haven't jumped on to play with it. Uh, is it obviously beating you over the head? 'Cause that was always the one thing about certain Hitman I played. It's like, oh, we have this giant room. You walk in. It's like giant **** flashing things of like, well, if I can elude the okay. No, I mean, this it feels organic that you're making it feel pretty organic. It feel there is a little bit of a learning curve, which is good.

And I would get in shootout after shootout and they and you just get punished for that. You can only take like two hits before you dead. Um, so it really does force you a to kind of think outside the box, even though you're in kind of a sandbox. Um, and you have to actually just you get rewarded for roaming around and discovering stuff, which is cool. So you get rewarded for like figuring out which costume get you into the right area and listening to people's conversations and picking up those clues that aren't the hardest thing on the planet to pick up.

Um, having said that, the last two missions I I did beat by just happenstance walking by the target. The target just walked in front of me and I just hit him and then ran. Nice. So, you know, there is that. Um, are do you feel inclined to replay those missions? 'Cause that's the thing with Aaron is that Aaron has been playing it like crazy, at least when Colin was originally talking about it, but she wasn't playing anything but Paris, right? She would play Paris and beat it one way and play it again and see if she could do this way.

Like uh Paris, I think the one that I did was like there's a there's you look exactly like the the lead fashion model and the person you're supposed to kill is having a is having a meeting with that person later. So you have to figure out how to take that person out, poses them, get your makeup done and go through. And it's really, really cool. But there's other ways to do it too. There's other people that are having meetings with her at the same time. Um, or you could just try to sneak upstairs, but you have to then like take out guards, cameras, **** that either take out guards, take out cameras, or you have to drop all your **** because you get frisked.

Gotcha. This game's release distribution plan was very interesting, unique. So yeah, it came out episodically over the last year. This you're now playing The Definitive Edition that came out on the PlayStation 4, right? Believe it's just the first quote season, right? Yeah, like so you're playing through that and they kind of like we we when we hosted the GameStop manager, wait, was that? Yeah, GameStop manager. We did the Square Enix thing.

So like what you're playing now is the definitive best version of all those episodes. Does it feel like a complete game when you're playing through or does it feel like separate episodes that are just kind of attached to? That's my kind of my only critique with the game is that it does feel a little disjointed. You're getting story, you're getting cinematic moments in between each one of these episodes. Um, and it's playing toward a larger overarching story, but I'm I'm I'm not as invested in honestly, to be honest, as I am in going back and playing those missions 'cause it's so much fun. That's the thing is I don't know how much that matters to people because it seems like that's the deal. Same thing with their high value targets. Like they not only did they do the episodic stuff, they gave you a reason to come back over and over and over",

That's a platform, which we always talk about like, make don't make a game, make a platform. And that was what I thought was fascinating when they put out Episode One. It's like, all right, cool. But what is it? Every do you know every few weeks or something, they release a new target or something for you to go. So it was like a reason to keep playing it. Are you talking about the targets that just pop up and you have only a specific amount of time to go get them? Yeah, well, they did special like we know Gary Busey was a target for different things like that. And they release that and the Hokkaido business. Whatever, it doesn't matter. But I mean, they were giving you a reason to replay the same stuff over. It's cool. Yeah. And again, it's like, you know, it's it's uh there's there's any which way to go about",

I mean, there's there's small stuff that that I think could add to the immersion of it. Like I think like for instance, one of my only small pet peeves is like I've been to Marrakesh. And so when you're walking around, you're hearing nothing but American accents. You're like, that's a little weird. Like everyone you're bumping into people like, hey, buddy, watch out. I'm like, that's not that's not sounds like. Um, and same with like Paris. Like they I don't think they went. Yeah, they you hear a lot of that. You you heard sort of a lot of the same that voice acting. So that that takes you out of it a little bit.

I think the rest be in the basement. You're like, I'm going to **** kill this guy with a cocktail. That's pretty fun. Yeah, yeah. Spoilers. You don't kill him with a cocktail. He he gets sick and you drown him in the **** toilet. You come up and he drinks it and you just like bash the glass, take the corkscrew, jab it in his jugular. Yeah. So we do always talk about games as a platform and kind of embracing that. But I think that when this game was first announced and like I remember when I played a demo of it at one of the events, I was kind of uh I went into it with some preconceived thoughts of like, oh, because this is being released episodically, it's less then. Like I kind of went into it imagining that it wasn't as important as a true Hitman game",

But like I I as you said earlier, I feel like everyone that has played it super loves it and like treats it as if it it was uh I think Jeff Gerstmann's game of the year last year. Well, that that was the thing with Giant Bomb. And I'm pretty sure I'm right on this because the Hitman keeps coming up because this is the thing where episodic is so fascinating in the way that when we talk about video games, right? We're talking about AAA games, whatever. We're talking about how Watch Dogs is this outlier right now that is charting even though it's been out months. That's bizarre. You know what I mean?

And then you never talk about it again till game of the year or something like that to every other month we talk about it. And Hitman's been such a brilliant burn on it where the way it was explained to me by I think either Dan Ryckert or some of our best friends who are also Giant Bomb fans is the fact that one of them loved it. It might have been Dan or I can't remember Vinny loved it. And then one by one, won everybody over until yeah, like everybody was in on it by the end of the year. H yeah, I mean, it's super fun.

We went out drinking with the Life is Strange folks afterwards. Uh, I remember playing and for me feeling me butting up against the rules of the game and getting frustrated because it's a demo.
