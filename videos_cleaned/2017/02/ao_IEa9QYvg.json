My name is Colin Moriarty, this is Greg Miller, Kevin Coello, I'm sorry, Nick Scarpino. Kevin Coello is off the screen over there, uh, over-grouper, over-grouping purveyor of Kevin Coello. Yeah, went too far again. No, it's not too far. Went too far. It's not too far when it's accurate, that's the thing. Not accurate. It's not stereotypes, Kevin, are only stereotypes unless they're really, really accurate to everyone involved. And we all know that you are the over-grouper and purveyor of of of Kinda Funny, of of of me. It's just German, Kevin, we're not speaking anything else. It's just German. That's how you say it in German. I'm cutting your mic. I love how off that shot is too. I know it's like a lot of a lot of space over here. Is this the Millennium Tower? That no, that's not it.

Uh, that it's getting worse and that people are saying that there's like some conject. First of all, no one can sell their building, their things in there because they're worth nothing. Yeah, then uh, it might fall over. People don't know the Millennium Tower is this massive building that was built in 2007, 2008 in San Francisco before all these buildings started going up. So it was one of the first new prominent buildings near the Bay. Now it's dwarfed by two buildings around. Yeah, because Salesforce is putting up there anyway. Uh, this building, uh, certain like Joe Montana lives in there, other people like famous people live in there. Um, the building is sinking and starting to tilt. Yeah, because for people I don't know, San Francisco was even San Francisco 7 miles by 7 miles and it was even smaller than that.

What ended up happening in the in the mid to late 19th century is that people started basically putting sand and rocks and debris around the edges, especially in the bay to make to extend it out. So the Marina and Cow Hollow and parts like that are not even really naturally part of San Francisco, which is why they were destroyed in the earthquake in 1906 land. So this building is apparently on sand, on some sort of wet sand. So first of all, water is already leaking in to the basement. They showed in the garages and they showed all of this footage of this. It's getting fucked up, not good. And and the building starting to sink and tilt. It sunk like 19 inches or something like that. Is the news done? Yes. And uh, and so anyway, I was reading about it and they were saying like this building might not real like it's not like a problem like where it's to like this building is maybe going to collapse or",

We're talking about a big building too. This is not this is not like a three-story apartment complex like live in. This is like a 50-story skyscraper highrise. Oh, it's bigger than 50 stories and it's huge like 54 stories. Is it really? Jesus Christ. But I mean if that thing goes, it's taking the next building over with it, you know what I mean? So what's funny about it, Nick, that you might find interesting and Kevin, I think we talked about this in the past, was that they're blaming it. They don't know what the problem is. They're blaming it on the sediment and and the builders are saying like it's not our fault. And then they're like, well, there are two things going on around it.

And they're some people are saying like they're actually fucking this building up because last I heard, um, that that's a lie that it's not that the new buildings are causing any issues. It's that when it was originally constructed, corners were cut, poor decisions were made. That's I mean, this is fascinating. This is going to be a fascinating story to tell because who who knows who knows, right? We'll see. I mean, clear Engineers. But if you're the contractor, right? If you're the person responsible for like the building like or the insurance company, right? You're going to want to put that blame out on every single person possible, right?

Oh, it's the city saying that. Yeah, cuz what's happening now is you know that like giant Garden thing they're building right next to Salesforce, sure, where it's it's going to be a Muni. I haven't seen it from like a sky. I I just seen it. It's going to be a Muni station. Looks really cool, cool. Um, the city is subsidizing like $7 million for that. And they suddenly were like, no, not anymore. Not until this gets cleared by that building. That's tremendously dangerous though, right? Like yeah, that's why they're not paying for it. That's that's that's bad. They're stopping payment for. You hear this all the time, by the way, because my wife has a lot of uh, she deals with a lot of rich",

And then lo and behold, there's all there's there this is not the first time this is has happened where someone's cut corners and like roofs are leaking or buildings are tipping and things like that. It's fucking despicable. But especially given how much you probably paid to live in this in this Tower, right? I mean, this is not like they were saying that that the buildings like it's like $3,000 a square foot to buy something there. Christ. Or was was $3,000 a square foot?

And then you just don't know. You just don't know. Anyway, totally unrelated anything we do, but we don't really do anything on the show anyway, really. Uh, go read it. It's an interesting story. I read it on uh, I don't know when I read. I read it yesterday on the train or something like that. So do you think they fixed this building and now is the perfect time to buy as much? That's some people are saying. I don't think they have a choice. They have to fix it, right? It's either they fix it or the building collapses.

It collapses and everyone dies inside of it. Yeah, in like a a cataclysmic event that's similar like 9/11. You buy it and rent it out and then put insurance. And then when it goes down, you get the insurance money and you hope those people weren't there. You you yeah, you pray they don't see you in the building like family. No, they can't see you. You just you just you know what you do is you rent to people who don't have families. You specifically rent to like orphans who just are transients that want to live here.

The uh, so the interesting kind of end note to this is that and this is the scary part is that they were saying the insurance across all the like the building and then and all that kind of stuff is spread out over multiple insurance companies. So, and that they that the companies, there's no way in hell the companies are going to pay this without sue without, you know, having to be sued. So they were saying like there's no real solution to this. And that the building they expect. So they were saying a building a unit was sold in there recently at like a fire sale. And the guy was basically convinced that they are going to fix the problem. They they say it's going to cost many tens of millions dollars",

And and then if there's an earthquake before then, that it could be very bad news for that building. So anyway, I thought it was an interesting kind of kind of story. You guys can check out. Has nothing to do with anything. Uh, more apropos. Yeah, uh, the Nioh, uh, Nioh. Some people are confused uh about that. The embargo's up. I played it for about five hours. Uh, first of all, it's getting great reviews. Um, I think it's a really fun game. I'm not very good at it. Uh, but it's a fun game. Uh, picture it's it's got an Onimusha vibe in terms of its environments, in terms of but it's not really as we knew, not really an Onimusha game.

Dark Souls is so plotting and slow and frankly not very fun for me. Uh, I liked Bloodborne because it got a little quicker and a little more arcadey. This game is very arcadey. Um, and so I think you guys if you if you understand what you're expecting there and what not, I think you're going to like it. I'm really looking forward to dumping some more time into it uh tonight, tomorrow, this weekend, etc. So I wanted to give everyone a heads up on that. An opposite heads up is that but I also downloaded Double Dragon 4 a few days ago. Uh, it's only $7. Uh, Arc System Works put it out. Uh, it's terrible, terrible, absolutely terrible.

It's people were like, well, it's an old game. Double Dragon was never that good to begin with. And I'm like, no, you're wrong. Double Dragon was awesome. This game just doesn't feel right. It doesn't have any design aesthetic. It doesn't it doesn't the different characters are weird. The the the hitboxes are strange. There seem to be no rules about how you get damage there. It's like it's it's not the combat that necessarily broken. It's just not very fun. So just keep that in mind in case you're going to download that. Although you might like it. I don't know.

Sony released its financials for the quarter ending on December 31st. The gaming business did great, and here's what Sony had to say, quote, sales increased 5. % year on year, uh, and the increase was primarily due to an increase in PlayStation 4 software sales, including sales through the network, and the contribution of PlayStation VR, which was launched on October 2016, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates, as well as the impact of a price reduction for PS4 hardware during the past",

Um, this console is not stopping, and, uh, I think it's pretty safe that it's going to hit 100 million and become the second best-selling PlayStation console and the second best-selling console, second best-selling console overall.

We want every customer to get the product and the deal that is right for them, whether that be new or pre-owned video game product, digital sale, or collectible. The Circle of Life generates great value for the customer. Consider these facts: GameStop issued approximately $1 billion of trade credits to our customers last year. 70% of the time, those trade dollars were immediately spent on new gaming products. I've heard many, how many of you are concerning this, and know that you work very hard to make sure our customers have a great experience. Thank you for that. While this",

Thank you for that. While this behavior described in the news articles are disappointing, I know they don't represent the vast majority of our associates and how they treat our customers. Um, so there's a followup there. I still, it still doesn't quite resonate or sync up at all with Jason's reporting, though. The issue yesterday was that they were incentivized to dissuade people from buying new gaming and new, new, new games and new hardware, right? According to Jason, the Circle of Life program at GameStop is split into four segments. Uh, the segments, I believe, are something like pre-owned games and et cetera, and so on. They need to reach, they need to hit three or four of those quotas, which requires them not to, or encourages them to push the de facto to not, right, push new hardware and new software. And in fact, according to these sources that",

For instance, he brought up Watch Dogs 2, I think, which is $54.99 used and $30 new. But they make more, the margin of selling the game. Uh, wait, did you flip those? No, I didn't. 54. It's, it's more expensive to get used, right? Because Watch Dogs 2 is so much. Watch Dogs 2 had a huge price cut. That might be that the, the used game price might be latent. Typically, a GameStop for a newer game, you're only getting $5 off the product, even though they'll only pay you whatever, $30. So the margin there is, is much bigger. The rip of a retailer typically is about $10 on a $60 game new within the first 90 to 180 days after it is.",
