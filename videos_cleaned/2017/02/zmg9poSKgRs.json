Nick, yes, what's your topic? My topic actually comes from Radiolab. You guys ever listen to Radiolab? Yeah, phenomenal podcast. Every once in a while, I'd get back in when I want some really intellectual, stirring conversation. Then I come back to you guys and thank you. We just talk about whatever. What's the next one? Kim Chi. Good topic actually, we'll get to it. But they had a great episode that one of the other, they called Lose-Lose, and they were talking, if you haven't heard this, please go overlooked for this one.

The topic was about the 2012 Olympic Badminton game, badminton game, excuse me, which I finally for the first time in my entire life learned how do you pronounce that. There's an extra, and there's no way I didn't know that. Badminton. That this particular round took place between a Korean team and Chinese team. Now the cost was, they both teams had made it into the finals. They did not need to win this game. In fact, it behooves them to lose this game because the winner of the game would go on to play a much harder Chinese team, while the loser of the game would go and play a much easier team. I think it was a Dutch team, I can't remember the specifics. So they started subtly at first, tanking the game, both sides not realizing that the other side was doing the exact same thing, right? And so you see him, we'd see with it a little bit here and there, go, I go, that's what would hit, and we just go directly to",

And so you see him, we'd see with it a little bit here and there, go, I go, that's what would hit, and we just go directly to things. But then it soon it became apparent to not only the people watching the games, but the judges, that they were intentionally both trying to lose this game. And it got to a point where one person would try to hit it out of the bounds, and the other one would sprint to try to save it to get it to also hit it out of the bus, right? Awesome. You can watch this online, by the way. You can go to YouTube and watch those clips of it, and it's hilarious because these are Olympic-level athletes. So when I hate them, badminton athletes, but still, I mean, top in their sport. Oh, I wasn't, it wasn't like an odd spill, be like, you know, like these people are Olympic-level athletes. They want to do something, they do it. They want to win. And so it because it begs the question, and ultimately what happens to these people,",

I'll just disqualify you. So they try to, they try to make it look like they're doing it, but ultimately it is, well, both sides get disqualified. That's awful. So it brings up at the very edge, and the guys realize, go see, but this is what I want to talk to you. It brings up a very interesting ethical question. When is it okay to lose if you are a professional athlete whose sole purpose is to win? That's the question. And in this case, do you think they were wrong or do you think they were right? Because they were trying to show you like the meta-game, right? They're playing a game, and then they start playing the",

Oh my, it's hard to get to do odds of this, but you'll see like, I mean, these are people that every serve goes into the net, every thought, they literally whiff the ball and like, I didn't get it. They did this, they like, I had a ball. And of course, it's incredibly shaming, especially for, you know, these high-level athletes to do this. Show me. It just begs the question because on the one hand, Colin and I were talking about this earlier today, like, it's not an unacceptable strategy if you are, say, in football and baseball, right? And you know that you're up, and you know that the statistics are your side, you're going into playoffs, so you don't necessarily want to start your starters, your reps, all the",

That's acceptable. But why wasn't it acceptable here in this specific, and still trying to win that game for the most part? Your third string comes in, your third string still show in, but if you lose that game, you're not going to be devastated, right? Doesn't share share share share any other. It's complicated. This is a very complicated, that's what we call them out of the cards, the super complicated issue because you see this in professional sports, releasing the United States, and I assume you see it overseas as well. And the leagues have taken some steps to stop people from tanking because especially in basketball, teams were actually actively starting the tank in order to get good draft picks because, you know, the draft is so limited in the NBA, the talent is so high in the NBA, and in the NBA, a",

And so like that, where there's too many players. So now, I'm not saying a great player in hockey doesn't make a team better. What I'm saying is, you're rolling four lines in a hockey game, you know, there are literally players on your roster. So, and they're all going to play. So, and basketball, you have a bench with, you have like 13 players over, but in half this, we're never going to see it. And LeBron James on your team is going to make a huge **** difference more than a Wayne Gretzky level player on your hockey team. Sure.

The Colts were 14 and 0 and had already clinched the division and a bye week and home-field advantage. They didn't need to win anymore, and they didn't care. Some teams have a pride thing, they wanted to go 16-0, but the Colts, right, we don't really care. They wanted to protect Peyton Manning, they want to protect their team. So they started Curtis Painter, who's a terrible quarterback, and like all their backups against the Jets, but just destroy them. The Jets starters are way better than the Colts second string. And so suddenly the Jets are eight and seven, and everyone's like, this is ****, including the teams that like, we're also in the race, are being like, we had to play the Chargers starters, you got to play",

Yeah. And they gave you a material advantage over us in the playoff race, and that's not fair. And people really complain about that. The Jets played the Bengals the next week. The Bengals, this is where things get interesting. This is not where I told you, this is an interesting analog. In game 16, the Jets play the Bengals in New York, and it already is seen that the playoff picture's already come into focus. And if the Jets, the Bengals knew if the Jets win, they will play them again in the first round of the playoffs. And the question became, do the Bengals play the Jets with their playbook open, or do they keep it closed and run the same five plays over and over again, knowing that the Jets will then have video to study from the week before, to prepare to",

Interesting. So the Bengals pretty much lost automatically against the Jets. And the Jets make the playoffs. Then the Jets go to Cincinnati and they beat them. And the Jets win and go on to the next round. And everyone's like, this all started because the Colts played their second string three weeks ago, and then the Jets played the Bengals. The Bengals didn't want to play their playbook, knowing that they were going to play them again the next week. So they lost intentionally, basically. And then they just end up getting in the playoffs and winning. And everyone's like, that's not fair. Yet that was the serpentine kind of way, right, that it went. And so it's an interesting analog.

You know, the Bengals weren't furious because the schedule put them against them twice throughout, which never happens in the NFL. No, of course not. Yeah, the Jets went on to what, the Super Bowl? They made the Championship game and lost. Oh, but they went farther. So I'm trying to tease him on that. But now I, fifty-fifty, I was like, me, hey man, maybe lay out after that. In the NHL, in the NBA, there's a lot of original dilemmas for the draft. Drafting is very important in sports. There's this came about because there were some questioning in the NBA if teams were intentionally losing in order this because people have to understand that the worst record gets the highest draft pick, and so on and so forth. So the best record gets the lowest draft pick. So it's to create parity, so a team that was really good",

So it's to create parity, so a team that was really good will get the worst of the best players available, you know, and the team that was the worst will get the best of the best players available in order to create parity. And the NBA was looking at this. The 76ers had recently done this for several years, for instance, and they instituted a lottery saying like, if you finish in the last place, you have a twenty-five percent chance of getting the first pick. There's no way we can keep doing this over and over again. And so in the NHL, and if the Oilers, who have been bad for a really long time, got I think something like four first picks in a row because the lottery just gave them, even though they didn't necessarily pick less, and they have this amazing stocked team now based on this random math to stop people from from failing. So this is a long-winded way of",

So this is a long-winded way of saying that like, these are problems that are encountered often. And my answer to the Olympics particular ethical thing is that if that's in the guidelines, then you have to play by the rules. And it's also not a team sport with standings and stuff like that. It's really like, what is it? It's a team sport with two pairs, you have to have a little pride too. And you can never be able to ask a player, even on the 76ers, when they were clearly trying to lose every game, you would never hear them say that they didn't try their hardest. They just sucked. You know, like that there's a major difference. So yeah, anyone, I don't know. I mean, I don't know, Greg, what, what's your take on this? But how do you feel?

Yeah, we got to do this. I'd rather advance than what turns out, they both get disqualified. What jobs? By the way, the coaches were talking them to do this. It wasn't their strategy. And that's where the game itself gets awkward. Yeah, I don't think it was up to them apparently. And the Radiolab, people explained it a lot better, but they were like, you, they were looking over the coach because she's like, don't do it.

No, I mean, I think, yeah, it's an interesting case in the sports we're referencing over here of the NFL stuff. And, you know, but I mean, like, you're cry-baby about the Jets. I get it. You can go **** yourself. It's what happened. You know what I mean? Like, that's just how the schedule played out. That's just how it all went down.

And, you know, they're talking about, I think in the car, an NBA ref was trying to fix games. Like there were not too long ago, there was, you know, Pete Rose was betting on games, although it didn't really have any material effect on the games when he was, when he was managing his career. Though it's a, unfortunately, he's probably most prolific hitter ever, and he's done that whole thing. But he had a great career. And we always get into this whole thing.

And I don't think you find any of these professional athletes on terrible teams saying like that they're not trying their hardest, or not playing hard. You know, the, you know, the interesting thing with the NFL, for instance, the Browns were one and 15 or whatever. They, they didn't win a game until very, very late in the year. But those guys are still playing for their jobs. Like they're still putting things on film and on tape to try to be a free agent, I try to go somewhere else with it, continued to play for the team.

You know, like that, they totally should have read the rulebook. They should have had a plan actually. And then they know, been able to activate my Trap Card.

Like little Melissa, she couldn't handle it if you act like you know you're doing it. I'm powerful. If I can make a real quick aside, yeah, I started laughing, but it looked like I was laughing one of your jokes earlier. I started laughing because I figured out we are living an episode of Seinfeld where Kramer had the dog's cough. And that's what Kevin has. Kevin has that damn dog **** pretty. Cause over there every so often, I mean, it's shot. It's funny because with Kevin, it's like, I don't know what more he could do to naturally cure himself of this, of this ailment, right? I'm sure he's sleeping a good eight to 10 hours, nine. I'm sure he's eating the most nutritious of lunch, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sure. And I'm sure **** sure he's not doing anything crazy to his, to his love, like smoking copious amounts of cigarettes of cool. Report, I saw, I saw a pack of Newports also leading all the butts, not",

I saw I saw a pack of Newports also leading all the butts not just one or two or three but all the butts just out on our roof back there like there's been a party. I'm sorry, on the ground and makes me feel accomplished. What, it makes you feel accomplished? Get an ashtray. Kevin, just take one week off with smoking, you'll knock that cold out. This, yeah right, he's not gonna do it. Are you counting the calories in the cigarettes and the burrito? So far he's eaten awesome burritos and eaten queso. It's actually kind of a genius move on his part, the hair, because they at first were all like, I was getting insane, it's too much, you know what I mean? But when he inevitably cuts it for the wedding, he is going to look 50 pounds lighter regardless of how many calories, at least three pounds of hair, at least. I don't know though, because the hair frames part like part of his face",

You're getting a little bit of like, you know, when will that when women put like push the hair forward, it makes the whole face looks skinnier again. You pull it back and get the full favor of it. You're the fat Stacy, exactly. So I don't know, a little back pain, I don't know what it's going to be, but I, Kevin, I'm going on record right now as saying this: I am wholeheartedly against you cutting your hair for the wedding. Wholeheartedly. In a few minutes, why do your hair looks so good? If I had your **** hairline, that is exactly what my hair would look like. That is exactly what would like the riffing about Kevin though is every so often I'll go back and see a photo or some video of him when he looked like a normal person, yeah, and then you see this every day, you forgot it used",

Yeah, now we're looking kinda like for a very long time and I give you a lot of **** when everyone else was pretending to like it, but I'll give you a cavity. You pushed through long enough, you never did the man bun, you never did any other trendy ****. You just **** owned this. He went from zero to Mel Gibson Lethal Weapon. I got it. I **** love it.
