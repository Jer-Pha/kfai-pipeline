Um, I want to talk about Horizon Zero Dawn a bit more, specifically Aloy being the main character, Aloy being a woman, this game featuring a female protagonist, and kind of the the repercussions that that has had on on on people's thoughts about the game and all of that. Colin, do you have anything? Yeah, I think uh, Greg and I got on PS I Love You, uh, an interesting letter from a guy, kind of, I'm kind of just paraphrasing it, but just that he has a problem with playing his females in games and there's too much, almost, I guess it's fair to say he was almost making the claim it's too much diversity and he can't relate to characters. His whole thing was, yeah,",

His whole thing was, yeah, as a man he can't relate to these games that are putting women into the title character. Um, and uh, you've been seeing this a lot because the there is a current of social justice in games coverage, which I I agree with and I think that it's kind of silly. I think most gamers agree with that. But the um, but it is important to have different touchstone representations, not for diversity, you know, I don't believe in diversity for diversity's sake. I've never believed, or not, I've used that term a lot. Um, I think that creators have to create um, the story they want. So if their story contains all white people, uh, well, that's the story. I mean, I don't think it's a racist thing. Um, or if it's just takes place with just men and there are not many women or any women, I don't think that's necessarily a sexist thing. Um,",

Um, but I understand that some people look at things like gender inclusion and race inclusion and all that kind of stuff in games and see it as a positive step, and I certainly don't see it as a negative step. I think it's great. Um, and but this particular gentleman kind of struck a nerve with me because it goes back to this idea, and I'm curious what you guys think about this, about like relating to characters or relating to the games you're playing. And I find it so strange, like from a very deep place in me, that anyone's playing a video game in order to relate to the character. I want to, I don't want to relate to the characters because I'm like, I have something in similar with Aloy. It's Aloy's story, so I'm I'm an observer of her story, and I don't want to even be involved in the telling of the story at",

It's Aloy's story, so I'm I'm an observer of her story, and I don't want to even be involved in the telling of the story at all, like in games like this. Now there are games like uh, that give you a lot of agency, like Mass Effect, where you can make your own characters, where I'm like, well, yeah, I'll play as a man. I'll play as typical male Shepard with his bald head because that's the way I liked it, because because I I'm was a little bit more of me in Shepard because I'm making all the decisions. I'm playing it in a way that that that resonates with me. But when I see things like that letter, or we read things like that letter, it's like, you can't, you can't, like, what are you trying to relate to? And also, why is it a negative that there's a female character in it? And uh, through that, and through that social justice vein that we were kind of talking about, there are some people that think like, Horizon's getting better scores",

Like, I just think it's all kind of silly. So it, I don't know how Greg feels about the issue. I mean, we talked about it a little bit on PS I Love You, but I mean, I mean, it's a multi-faceted issue, and you presented a whole bunch of stuff there. I I, you talk about like relating to a character, I don't think is a foreign concept, but I also don't think it is, and and it's different for every person, I assume too. But I relate to Aloy, and even though I don't think you think you do, or that's like a touchstone to it, you do as well. Like, right, she has this father figure in Rost, and so like, they're playing on your emotions of what you feel about your family or your dad or your father figure, or how you would feel to have a character like that. And that's a a part",

And that's a a part of it. And so there's those touchstones that I jump to where I feel like you can relate to characters in so many different ways, where with like Dead Space, Isaac Clarke is just a, he's he's an engineer dude. He's not Bro Force, I'm here to kill everybody, man. And so when he gets sucked into this whole adventure, I feel for him of like, whoa, this isn't what he signed up for, kind of thing. And to an extent, Nathan Drake as well, right? Who is a **** world famous pirate killer dude, but is affable and enjoyable and has friends and family and would like to hang out with them, but he has this, he wants to go do something and solve this mystery, and it just happens that he has to kill a million people in one Drake's blue slap. That doesn't make any sense. But then on the other hand, right, where it's like you're",

But then on the other hand, right, where it's like you're picking and choosing for me with Mass Effect, uh, the original trilogy, I enjoyed it and I had a great time with it, but no, I played as FemShep, and that's not where I'm going with there relating thing. I never related with Shepard, period, because they were so militant. I talked about this uh, in last week's Gamescast, talking about Andromeda, in the fact that this time the Pathfinders like, oh, you guys are straight up normal people, having jokes, having this levity, da da da, whereas like, Commander Shepard always, even when I'm playing as FemShep and making choices and trying to **** Garrus, like, you are very much still talking in like, well, you know, regulations this and blah blah blah. And I'm like, that's a turnoff to me, and that's my main turnoff with like, um, Call of Duty games usually, of the whole",

Like, I don't like, I don't like playing war that seriously where we're saluting and talking about Admirals and this, that and the other. And so that's me, and those are my personal biases, and that's the kind of thing where I just don't care about jarhead talk, and why I don't see most military movies that are like in the **** like that. And so I understand needing to relate on some level to a character. I just don't think I've ever had it so boiled down, so base level where I'm like, oh, it's a chick, don't care about her experience. Clearly there's nothing I can relate to her, right? Like, that's not the point. That's not the disconnect for me. Yeah, no, that's interesting. I mean, you you bringing this up, it reminds me of me watching movies, and I think that the difference between movies and video",

I mean, you you bringing this up, it reminds me of me watching movies, and I think that the difference between movies and video games, specifically games like this that are very cinematic and narrative driven, uh, there there's a lot of similarities to movies. The difference being movies are something that you just experience. Uh, video games are something that you interact with. So you are Aloy, 'cause you are controlling her agency and what she's doing at that time, literally the choice of what she's saying. Uh, but when it comes to movies, it's like, I I think about how I relate to the characters. It's kind of what you're saying, it's never like, I relate with this character 100%, and I'm in on this. Um, there's a movie Sing Street that uh, Miss Movies was talking to us about, and it's like the story of this dude that tries to impress some girl by scheming and forming a band, even though he doesn't play music. And I'm like, that character",

And I'm like, that character I think I can relate to more than any character of all time, right? But I can't look at any other movie and be like, oh man, I I pretty much fully relate with this character and their struggles, and this is my story. Yeah, so when you take that to video games, I'm like, it's it is more about do you relate to the situations they're in? Do you relate to the decisions that they have to make? And um, the the obstacles that they have to face? And uh, with with Aloy in specific, it's like, all right, Aloy, Nathan Drake, their sex doesn't matter to me. And again, that is being said as somebody that has grown up playing as a white dude in video games forever. Shout out to my boy Mario. What up, Mario? You know, so it's like, but I can imagine that it is empowering for the sake of diversity and whatever that even if it doesn't um,",

You know, so it's like, but I can imagine that it is empowering for the sake of diversity and whatever that even if it doesn't um, add to the game, she's a woman. It does to women who haven't played as too many female characters, except for Lara Croft or Samus, or you know, of course there is a whole bunch of them. But like, it's like, even though to us we don't relate extra because it is, there are people that do relate more because of it. And I think that's a an interesting way to to look at it because I relate to this Sing Street character in a way that I don't think, I mean, you guys wouldn't, you know, it's all lenses and I get that. And that's something we've talked about before, usually when we're talking about like LGBT stuff, where it's like, well, the reason I think this should exist and these characters should exist because I want people, you know, the the minority groups among us to feel like, oh, they are being represented and they're",

And that's what I think Horizon does so well is the fact that really Aloy faces a lot of prejudice in the game because of where she's from. It's there's like one, I think there's one in the with the whole hunting quest and getting the Hunting Lodge. People were like, I can't believe a woman's in, you know, in the running to be in charge of of the Hunting Lodge. That's like the only time it's really said. But even that is a secondary problem to the fact of her background and what's happening. I mean, I think that also though, that that it being a minor thing still and not just being totally written out is normalizing that this is still an issue, and no matter what anybody, everyone, the biggest issue,",

And it's the same thing, right? In Horizon, there's a, I think at least one side quest where like, talking to a dude and he's like, yeah, my lover is, you know, I missing and I need you to. And it's like, cool, not like, oh, you're gay, or hey, I'm gay. Like, it's not that, just like, hey, the person I love the most is missing, maybe dead, can you check it out? Yeah, I can do that. Do the same thing I do, check their trail, find them, come back. I think it's all about how you define relate. And and and that's why, that's why I'm I always been a little confused by this because uh, no, I can't relate to Aloy, and I can't relate to anything that happened in Horizon. It's about a",

It's about a woman in the future in an Earth on an Earth that is destroyed, uh, and it's roamed by mechanical animals. There is nothing there for me to relate to. And that's why it's, that's why it's fun, you know, like, because I live a more mundane life in the real world. Like, I guess what I'm saying is like, I see things like this and I'm like, I get excited by a diversity of characters and a diversity of stories and perspectives, not for not through any lens of like, let's all, let's get everyone represented, because I I like, I think the artists have to represent them their art the way they are. Aloy is a is a a white woman. I'm sure that that bothers people because she's not a black woman or something like that. I'm like, who cares? Like, it's it, like, if Aloy was a man, it wouldn't really make any difference to me. Um,",

Um, but I like seeing those things because they they provide perspective, not not like, not you can't relate to someone else's perspective unless that is your perspective, you know? So like, I I I play these games the same way like we talked on PS I Love You, where I was like, it's it's like reading a book. Like, I'm not reading a Tom Clancy novel being like, man, I can relate to the the the general here. It's like, no, I'm I'm I'm this is someone else's story. I have no control over this. Like, this is, you know, even when you have agency or controlling games, you really don't. I mean, we know that like, there's no truly, there's no true game in which like any permutation, you're not going to find a permutation that wasn't planned in some way. And so I see things like this and I'm like, are first of all, I think it's",

I think that's fine. But I I I guess it showed me a little bit of a disconnect in the way I play games, the way I consume fiction, where um, we all have seen those movies like where it's, you know, Seinfeld, like, oh, you're Jerry and I'm George and all. It's like, but like, you can't relate to them. You have no idea. Like, there's not nothing about me. I love George. I love Larry David. That's a really great example. Like, I wish I was Larry David because I think he's so **** funny, a flying **** about anything and just lives his life. But I'm not like Larry David really in any way, you know?",

I can't relate to Larry David was doing. That's not why I watch Curb Your Enthusiasm. I watch it because it makes me laugh. And that and and so see things like that and I'm like, why do people need fiction to relate to fiction? It's just strange. Like, I I absorb fiction to because I don't want myself like, to for it to be about me, to I don't want it to be about my world. I don't want it to be about anything that has to do with me. That's why it's fun. I don't watch Band of Brothers and I'm like, man, I'm just like, you know, Winters here. I'm like, no, this is no, not Colin's not involved in this. I hear you.

And I and that's the thing, but I think it's games are different than reading or watching. And that's the thing where it is like, Tim can go play the game, and you and I are super stealthy, and he's using, which I only used for, you know, critical strikes after I had taken somebody down by their weakness and stuff. So there is that choice of I'm playing the game the way I I play the game. I'm using the weapons I use. You use that machine gun thing I never even bought. Or right, but that's, but that goes back to like, that's that's us playing a video game. Tim brought up like Mario. It's like, if you can relate to certain characters and certain things, just like you can relate to a protagonist or an antagonist in a book, then certainly you should be able to at a base level relate to anything going on in a video game. But you can't relate to Mario. Who the **** relates to Mario, you know?",

That was, but the the uh, Toad Toad was the G. He picked things up quickly. Now could fly. Excuse me, Toadstool. **** this Peach. ****. So I don't know. It's like, it just, it, I guess it's kind of a multiple points because a, I think it's great that there's diversity in games because I think that that that is empowering and important to people out there. It's not important to me, but I am a white male. I accept that. I and while I don't agree with diversity for diversity's sake, I do agree with diversity of perspectives and diversity of stories that can be told.

I was like, this would be much more relatable if the the mechanical dinosaur hunter in the apocalyptic future was a man. Like, I guess that's what I'm saying. Like, there's nothing relatable in that story. And when you look at video games, there's almost nothing relatable in any story if you define relate and relatable as the definition of the word, you know? Like, as a, and that's that's why I think that, you know, I get a little disturbed with the with this like, this this rancor about about women, about about inclusion being inclusionary. I'm like, of course we should have those things. But why can't this guy, I'm hung up on this guy. I'm like, why can't you relate to someone who's not a white man? It's just weird, you know?

When I watch uh, um, God, I watch John Adams, and I love, I revere these men that they're portraying, but I'm like, I can't relate to their experience. That's what's fun about it. I can't relate. I live in **** 2017. I own a business. I live in a an apartment with my friend Kevin's kind of your slave though, so you can relate on that. That that's not funny, Greg. You can't joke about slavery.

And uh, yeah, someone uh, posted a there an article on The Guardian, and it was Horizon Zero Dawn, the feminist action game we've been waiting for. Didn't read the article, but you headline in general, like, that's, you can kind of like, you know, that that's going to get some negativity attached to it, right? And his response to it was, he posted it, and um, the subject line was, is this game all about sexism? And then in it was said, this article's just put me right off the game. Is it going to be all political and a little social justice warrior circle jerk about how powerful women are like this article suggests, or is it just going to be something that normal people can just play and enjoy?

It's like, look at the game, make your own kind of decisions from it. And that's thing, it's like, I I think that there is nothing wrong uh, with with people taking some type of political understanding from playing the game. Like, that's a good thing when there's layers and it's deep and it means different things to different people, right? Like, I would be shocked if there was a a AAA PlayStation 4 exclusive game on the level of Horizon where it's like, you play it through and the only thing you can take from it is this is a feminist game. If you play through the game and play through the story and it's like, oh, I can see some feminist uh, you know,",

Yeah, I I agree in the sense that, you know, I agree with you, but I also to his, not to his point, but the contrary or or a different point of view is that when you see, and this is why like, like the just the **** endless uh, you know, um, my my uh, the Rubin Report, a show I really love, Dave Rubin, a buddy of mine runs it. He made up this called the Oppression Olympics, which is like my favorite, my favorite term that I've heard in a long time, where he's like, everyone is trying to be more oppressed than the next person, and and everyone's judged and based uh, judged based on like, how oppressed are you?
