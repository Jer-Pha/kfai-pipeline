Now Kevin likes records all of a sudden, don't you know? For a second, I got, you know what's funny is, here's what it was. It started off and I was like, \"God, that's so terrible.\" And then midway through, I was just in La La Land. I was like, \"You know what? I **** love that movie. I miss it. I should go back and watch it.\" What's up everybody? Welcome to the Kinda Funny Morning Show for President's Day 2017, February 20th. We don't take holidays here, Kevin. I'm just joking around. So I have, I like records. I'm a hipster pretty much. Yeah, 'cause it just came out of nowhere. You got your little Urban Outfitters record player down there, but it's okay, we still love you. It's not Urban Outfitters, it was like a cheap Amazon one. It's great. That's even more hipster. That's even more hipster. I hate you guys. I can't have fun, huh? No, you can have fun.

I'm going to turn it around on you and you. Lego Batman Movie is going to be great. It's definitely, I never said The Lego Batman Movie would be great. It's going to be the best Batman movie ever. I think I said Tom Hawkins is welcome. Look, I think I said it was probably DC's best shot at a great movie. I might have said it was a lock that'd be a great movie and I was wrong. You fell asleep and I was disappointed. It's crazy how many people been tweeted and be like, \"Man, I disagree.\" It's like, \"Well, all right, cool.\" But there's a lot of reasons that those people who are tweeting like, \"I disagree,\" are where they are and we're where we are, being **** tastemakers.

I'm like, \"Wait, wait, what did you come down on The Lego Movie?\" I like Lego Movie. Yeah, I think it's a game of expectations. Lego Movie, I didn't see till it was on, you know, whatever, internet. And it was like the, I was like, \"This doesn't seem like a movie I'm going to like.\" And everyone's like, \"No, you wouldn't.

The movie's over. And so then Kevin looks, looks at me. He was trying to look, you know how Kevin does that thing where he wants to talk to you? So he just says, it was like they just went into like the end credit song. And again, so many people had tweeted me saying, \"You're going to love the movie and you're going to love the end credits.\" I'm like, \"Great. Okay, great.\" So maybe this is going to be the redeeming factor that ends. I'm like, \"That wasn't good either.\" And I turned to Kevin.

I think I was like 15, 20 minutes in. Just out. Just not a movie for me. I didn't, I, I was talking to Zy Zyger, big old Zy, who might be in the chat, I'm not sure, um, about it. And it was just that thing where for me it was in between like, you know, Darren Brazil saw it with his son. He, so he's like, \"I have a different take.\" I'm like, \"I understand that.\" You take my, my thing was, I felt like it was lost in this weird, meandering middle, MH, where it wasn't being a DC movie. It wasn't being over-the-top crazy movie. It was just like, \"I'm Batman.\" I'm like, \"Well, you're not even enjoyable.

So do you feel like it was a, \"Hey, we need to get a movie out pretty quickly to capitalize?\" I mean, I'm totally in the minority. Overwhelmingly, people love this movie. I'm, I'm, yeah, I don't either. I'm glad you all enjoy, don't get me wrong. But real quick, I'm sorry, my other side where I was driving about it was people like, \"Well, you know, you're just not animated guy. You're not a kid movie guy.\" And this is, I'm like, \"I get all that.\" But my problem is that the Lego Batman, I don't know what you call them anymore, but what they would be direct to DVD, like they don't go to theaters, but they go to Amazon.

I just, I was like, \"I don't understand why everyone likes this.\" Everyone thought, \"Everything Is Awesome.\" It's start, \"Everything Is Awesome.\" Like, \"This is the most annoying song I've ever heard in my life.\" And the animation style was like giving me flashbacks to **** Nam.

Greg's pushing his LOL.\" This is not what it's about. First off, what did you, that wasn't a DC movie. That like the point of the movie had like, it could have been any characters in there. It didn't feel like it at all. They don't like the, the, what the best cut of DC joking in there is like when they go through all the crazy villains and Condiment King's there.

Yeah, I'm sure they'll make it money, but if they can, I'll be gold. What PIR TV Pro says, \"John Wick 2 was a disappointment as well.\" How dare you, sir? Wow. How dare you, sir? First off, John Wick 2 is just more of John Wick. So if he likes John Wick One, how the **** could you not like John Wick 2? It's the exact same movie except with more crazy **** happening.
