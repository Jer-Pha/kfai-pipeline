            "text": "Greetings and salutations and welcome back to Colin Was Right. Today I want to spend some time highlighting a really fantastic piece of games journalism done by one of the video game industry's very few actual journalists who you know does journalism. Then I want to jump off from his story to a separate yet related topic. Over at Kotaku, Jason Schreier, who is a primarily online buddy of mine, in case you want to take my endorsement with a grain of salt, wrote a couple of really interesting articles with tons of the almighty gold dust of journalism, primary sources. In fact, Jason has primary sources galore, which is what lends so much credence to his reporting. The topic of Jason's reporting this go-round was GameStop, the massive games retailer that runs game stores and other tangentially related businesses across the United States as well as in 13 other countries. They with their alternate brand EB Games have long been synonymous with retail software and hardware purchases. But according",

They with their alternate brand EB Games have long been synonymous with retail software and hardware purchases. But according to Jason's reporting, some employees and stores have also been over their consumers to maximize the corporation's bottom line. The Kotaku stories in question involve an internal GameStop quota program called the Circle of Life, a program introduced in 2016. The Circle of Life, according to sources speaking with Kotaku, revolves around giving quote. Each GameStop store different percentage quotas for pre-orders, reward card subscriptions, used game sales, and game trade-ins. Each of these quotas is based on the store's total transactions. Pre-orders and reward card subscriptions are based on the number of transactions, while used game sales and trade-ins are based on the total dollar value of transactions.

If a store's quota for used game sales is 30% and the store sells $1,000 worth of merchandise, GameStop expects at least $300 of that merchandise to be pre-owned. So, if someone walks into GameStop and picks up, say, a brand new copy of Yakuza Zero without pre-ordering another game, subscribing for a new rewards card, buying a used game, or trading in some games to help pay for it, then the transaction will knock down all four percentages.\" End quote. But that's not the whole story. Because Jason has collected source after source after source confirming that due to fears of various reprisals, including being reprimanded and even fired, GameStop employees are essentially encouraged, sometimes directly and other times by simple inference, to at times mislead customers, to keep the Circle of Life numbers within acceptable ranges.

GameStop stores, according to this reporting, need to work on keeping three of the four Circle of Life elements above water to their maximum ability. selling new games and new hardware simply isn't as profitable to GameStop as selling used is. That's the market they want. One of Jason's sources says the following quote, \"We are telling people we don't have new systems in stock, so we won't take a $300 or $400 hit on our pre-owned numbers. This is companywide, and in discussions with my peers, it is a common practice. We also tell customers we don't have copies of new games in stock when they are on sale.

It's worth noting that some sources contradict or otherwise play down the general narrative that GameStop is overtly predatory. GameStop also provided statements disputing the overall nature of the reporting. I'll leave it up to you to go and read the full breadth of the reporting and then to draw your own conclusions. In any case, reading all of this made me curious about just how much money GameStop makes off of pre-owned hardware and software, especially in comparison to what it's selling new. In 2015, GameStop did $9.36 billion in gross revenue with a net profit of $4.8 million. The company remains profitable even as both domestic and international store numbers shrink year",

The company remains profitable even as both domestic and international store numbers shrink year after year. And it seems to remain profitable based at least partially on its push of pre-owned goods, the singular focus of the Circle of Life. A full quarter of GameStop stores total revenue, 5.4% 4% in 2015 to be exact, comes from pre-owned games and systems. That same year, 51.8% of revenue came from brand new factory sealed titles and consoles. Pre-owned isn't in any way, shape, or form a tiny portion of its business, which is why the churn of used items is such an essential part of the Circle of Life, and why employees seem pressed in varying degrees to meet these quotas.

Similar erosions are happening in parallel mediums. More people are listening to music than ever, Billboard Notes. As physical album sales are falling off a cliff. years ago, The Verge tells us, digital music sales surpassed physical music sales, and the inverse will never be true again.

And unlike vinyl, there isn't even a quality-driven upside to physical, though you certainly have more control over what you do with a physical game as opposed to a digital game. GameStop knows that the end is nigh. It's why it has a diverse portfolio of properties, including mobile phone stores and even an internal games publishing apparatus. It even owns Game Informer, though the magazine's continued relevance has a great deal to do with it being in GameStop stores with wildly inflated subscription numbers tethered to its rewards program.

What I'm getting at here is that GameStop is in full decline, and it won't be able to stem the tide, even with seemingly dishonest tactics. CNBC reports that GameStop sales slid a disastrous 6.6% in a month-to-month comparison, contrasting November of 2015 to November of 2016. Overall sales for GameStop in 2016 were down 16.4% compared to 2015. These aren't small numbers.

I guess what I'm saying is the Circle of Life reminds me yet again how much I hate the retail gaming market and why I think it needs to go the away already because I truly believe we'll all win when it does. First, some pertinent data. CNBC relayed information from SuperData Research indicating that even from July to August of 2016, digital sales on console rose 16%. VentureBeat reports that overall digital sales grew 10% contrasting December of 2015 to December of 2016, while retail sales fell 16% just from November of 2016 to December of 2016. a fraction of the time.

Not for nothing, but that number is never going to shrink. GameStop knows that they're in for a world of hurt in the coming years, which is why they even discussed trying to get into, get this, the used digital games market. That's right. They want to sell you used digital games, or they did at least, because everyone knows that's absolute nonsense. This idea first came to light in 2011, according to GameSpot, and was reiterated again as recently as 2015. Like I said, they're a desperate company because I couldn't imagine a world where any hardware manufacturer or publisher would entertain this idea in a million years. But I digress.

Let me explain why I think the move to digital is a good thing for consumers before I get into what I think is holding everything back and why you should remain hopeful but skeptical. The major thing to be positive about here is the fact that digital pricing should bring game prices down should the gaming market act like pretty much every other market behaves. As I've demonstrated many times over the years, including a popular much circulated article back when I was at IGN, gaming is demonstrably and undeniably cheaper than it has ever been. Period. Hardware is cheaper in real inflation-adjusted money and so too is software. that simply cannot be contested. So, please don't waste your time trying. The question then becomes if the move to all digital and away from stores like GameStop could bring prices down even more. And the answer, if",

And the answer, if all things are equal, is an emphatic yes. As I reported last week, when a major retailer buys batches of your typical AAA games from a publisher with the intent of selling those games for $60, the publisher ends up grossing somewhere around $35 per game sold. The retailer typically keeps around $1. $5 or so goes to manufacturing and shipping costs and $8 or so goes to the hardware manufacturer that game was sold on as a sort of gatekeeping cost. Only that latter cost conceivably would carry over to an all digital marketplace. GameStop and other retailers along with inflation and obvious corporate greed are the three pillars of what keeps game prices from falling.

As I told you on last week's column was right, it's conceivable that if the status quo was kept in terms of distribution and some political nonsense happens in the United States, prices may just go up. It's true that right now digital game prices are comparable to retail game prices and digital games actually stay more expensive for longer periods of time. The thing is, you have to understand why that is. There's no doubt that every stakeholder involved in publishing from the hardware manufacturers to the Activisions and Ubisofts of the world would love to charge less for their digital games to drive sales volume. Even if they sold those games for say $50 new instead of $60 new, the publishers would make more money selling those games digital based on the math we just discussed because middlemen would be removed. They can't play the undercutting game though, as the GameStops and Amazons of the world need to be placated",

You need a store to sell it to you, and no stores will have very little interest selling hardware that will then allow cheaper software to be sold, thus cutting them out of the picture. This is the delicate dance of the gaming industry, and we've all been watching it unfold since the genesis of Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. Skirmishes and border wars have been fought in the years past to turn the tables in the publishers's favor, like the dreaded online passes of Yore. But the physical versus digital battle wages on and it's a very important battle indeed. Either way, the market isn't allowed to react to market forces because of this chess game.

A chess game, by the way, with an inevitable outcome. Unencumbered by the worry of retail partnerships, however, the situation changes markedly. Imagine a scenario in which digital sales started to rise to such an extent that even as hardware pushers, the retailers no longer had the requisite leverage to keep the playing field even. Imagine if these retailers were put into a position to protect an important portion of their revenue, hardware sales, at the sake of software. New hardware accounts for $1 of every $5 GameStop grosses, as an example. Suddenly, publishers have the freedom to compete on a more open market. Maybe EA says, \"Our new games will now be $50.\" Not to be outdone, Activision follows suit, while Ubisoft, ready to get crazier with it, announces a $40 price point.

And it's true that we're dealing with bottom line obsessed corporations, but I really do believe that some smart executive is eventually going to tip a domino. And once that happens, everyone else will be forced to comply or they'll be priced out of the market completely. It's like what Sega attempted to do to EA back in the day with its NFL franchise, but to a much, much grander extent. An important negative to point out, of course, is internet bandwidth. For starters, to download your standard AAA game, which could be 0, 30, 40 gigabytes or more, you'll need reliable, fast internet, and you'll need to be free of data limits if you want to have any realistic chance of downloading a few of these games a month, possibly playing them online,",

And while it hasn't stymied the wholesale takeover of digital games on PC, the console market is historically slow to adapt and change.
