Now that one came from a question come up later in the show. That's Jacob's Cabin 108 who called you that. Of course, it's a shout out to ECW Joel Gerner. But I want to put in there, how are you, Colin? I'm good, thanks. What's been going on? I haven't seen you in a long time. Just doing this and that, you know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Yeah, just hanging out and uh, you know, just being myself. Being yourself or beating yourself? Well, I'm beating myself once, twice a day at least, but but I'm being myself otherwise. How's that working for you? I mean, gotten me this far, I guess. Have you been to New Andronico's yet? No, New Andronico's is up and running. Yeah, how is it? I I was too sick to go, but I had photos taken by Jen for me. She took some photos over there.

Had that Safeway card 10 years. See, I I've had a Safeway card forever. This is, of course, Safeway, the grocery chain here in California, uh, that I signed up for at the register and they gave me the card. And then I stopped carrying the card with me.

So there you go, Nathan, having the exact same problem you're talking about. It is sold out everywhere. People have been complaining about that a lot of stuff in there that time around.

Um, I think I also restarted it once at some point. But uh, the uh, the thing with Nioh, I think is that I think Sony just under underestimated the demand for the game, which is strange because the PlayStation has made a home for a Souls-type games.

And that is that it's incredibly hard. Is that is the game's incredibly hard difficulty. Now, I love a challenging game. Bloodborne is still my favorite PS4 exclusive. And Dark Souls 3 was my favorite game of last year. So I cannot wait to give Nioh a shot. But even I have slightly been put off by some of the things I've read about the game. Dark Souls and Bloodborne are very difficult, but also fair.

Uh, Colin has mentioned a World at War in the past and how he he just had to give up on the game while playing on veteran because it was ridiculous. I've been experiencing something similar with Modern Warfare Remastered and playing through on veteran. Infinite enemy spawns and grenade spamming. And while I've recently completed it, it was pretty awful due to its absurd difficulty. Now, I understand a game's difficulty can be very subjective, but when a game like Nioh comes out and is unanimously thought of as extremely difficult, even to a fault at times, I just thought this question would be an interesting one to discuss. Can games be too difficult, Colin? Yeah, a game can be too difficult. I'm not sure that Nioh is that game. I I I mean, there are harder there",

Some of these games that are just absurd. Even Super Meat Boy is is is mechanically harder than Nioh. Um, but uh, the problem Nioh is that it's unbalanced. I I think that that's that's my major issue with it. Having spent a you know, just that amount of time with it before it came out, which was you get you get better as you go around the map. You get more you get more uh, daring and go longer periods of time because when you when you go to the to the shrines to save your game and and to heal yourself, all the enemies respawn.

And it's not any different than what is really in Dark Souls or or Bloodborne in that respect. The problem is for me is the is the ridiculous spike in difficulty when I was fighting that boss on the boat. And uh, I was looking up videos because that that boss was in the alpha and the beta. And so I was looking up videos and what I realized pretty much uh, ubiquitously across all of the videos is that people that were fighting this boss and having success against it were way more powerful than I was and way more powerful than they should have been at that point in the game.

And what I've been reading about with this first boss is that a he's harder than almost all the other bosses in the game by the time you reach him. And uh, that he doesn't need all this these hit points. And there is an unpredictability in my in my experience fighting him where the first third of the fight is pretty easy. He has these two like Morning Star like ball and chain kind of things. He's like whipping around and you kill him. And then eventually you snap those and he uses the ball.

Monster closets and and unlimited spawning and grenade spam are ridiculous and and and and lazy ways to make a game hard. I don't think Nioh is lazily hard. I just think that that first boss probably should been the third or fourth boss. Yeah, sure.

You know, it's a tightrope of I think the fights that always stand out to me as great boss fights or Great Moments in video games in terms of gameplay usually are overcoming something you didn't think you could overcome or not understanding how to overcome something until you did understand till it clicks. And that's like the magic of games is understanding like what we're talking about. Okay, cool. What does this boss do? Let me learn his I'm going to get my teeth kicked in four or five rounds, but then I'm going to understand what the **** he's trying to do and then be able to take him down that way.

Like in terms of what's sold, what's happening, critical reception, all this different stuff.
