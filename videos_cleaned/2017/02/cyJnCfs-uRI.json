Kojima has his own little room within our room, right? That is like kind of just like a tent, the Kojima tent. How big is his tent? It was a big like, [unintelligible] by two.

Like he, when he walked into, there was a media party that we had, um, where it was just people that were exhibitors or people covering RTX Sydney, and then us goofballs. We were there. When Kojima walked in, everyone was just kind of like, yeah, you know. And uh, one of our friends came up to, came up to us and was like, \"Hey, like you guys, like you familiar with Kojima's games, right?\" And it's like, \"Yeah, yeah, we know. Yeah, you know, we might, might played a thing or two. When he comes in, we might bring him over to you so he, somebody to talk to.\" Like, \"He's going to be fine. He's going to be fine.

That day starts with you and me going to breakfast, of course. Mhm. But then I meet up with Kojima, his team, the RTX Sydney team at like 1:30 and then walk over to the convention center with them. Uh, then proceed to hang out with them the rest of day, rehearse our panel, walk to the theater we did our panel in where uh, Joshua or Josh, Josh Bog, that's what I said, right? He does, he did his panel uh, with Kojima the next day. We see the whole thing, get the lay of the land kind of thing, blah, blah, blah, blah. I wasn't allowed to go with you.

We're not like boys.\" Of course. \"Have you been like, have you been to his place in Japan? Have you been to his, been invited?\" That's what I'm telling you. On the panel, he said, when I was asking what the **** is Death Stranding, he said, \"If I come to Japan, I can play.\" Why are we here? I know we're going. No, I'm going. He didn't say play it.

Let's go back to, I wonder if we should figure out if we can upload that panel on our channel. That'd be cool. Okay, I'll hit him up. Why aren't we just stealing the other panel? So why don't we steal that panel too? I don't know. This one feels a little bit like again, 'cause it's Kojima, man. Back to my point, you're not stealing from Kojima.

Uh, this is before Up at Noon, so we'll say 2013, 2014, maybe even. And uh, for some reason, the lines are all kind of merged together where it's like, if you're going to actually go and sit down for the conference, great, you're in this line. And if you're just a fan who's hoping to get in, you're in this line. And so it's kind of like pandemonium to an extent. Uh, Colin and I are lined up and I look behind me and I see Kojima and his, you know, friend back then, a translator who is in his translator now. And I was like, I turn back to Colin, I'm like, \"Holy **** ****, Hideo Kojima's behind us!\" And Colin looks back, he's like, \"We got to take a picture.\" He's like, \"I never do this, but we got to.

I was able to get out an IGN business card and hand it over and they looked at like, \"Oh, sure. Sorry, we didn't, you know, we took the photo. Everything's great. We posted it, forget all about it.\" Then uh, my career takes a turn obviously and I do start doing Up at Noon front facing stuff. IGN starts using me as a personality and all",

And that we go to that uh, it was me and Caleb went to New York for the PlayStation 4 launch event where they took over that hotel and every room had a game and a developer in it. And then this is the PlayStation 4 launch event where we were getting it and different things like that. And so I was going to interview Kojima there and that was the first time I was actually going to sit down and interview Hideo Kojima. And so we go up to the room and I'm still rocking the, this is the one where I, I had the vest on and the purple tie and I interviewed Shu and did a one-on-one with him. Uh, I go up there and we, we only brought two wireless lavs. So it was like, \"All right, cool. We're going to mic Hideo and mic his translator and then Greg, you'll sit off behind Cameron, ask questions.\" And, \"Oh, great. No",

I sit behind the camera and Caleb's like, \"All right, everybody ready to go?\" And Hideo says something and his translator goes and turns around. He goes, \"Mr. Kojima would like to know why we're not getting the full Greg Miller experience.\" And I was, I'm like, \"You've seen Up at Noon and you know what's going on.\" I'm like, \"Holy, yeah, okay, sorry, yeah, blah, blah.\" You know, I start falling over my myself at that point of like, \"Yeah, no, no, you was just a translator, the mic and blah.\" He like, \"Oh, no big deal. You got to come Up at Noon sometime.\" Never did, Dick. Um, but no, I'm kidding. Right, we all know it seems like he was on a short leash for there.

So like, I think we're building this relationship of like, \"Okay, I'm a big fan and like this, that and the other.\" And I know a few people on his team and I talk to them casually every so often and there's whatever friendship or acquaintance you want to call it happening. Boys. Yeah, exactly. Boys. And then it was, you know, when I went down to do that Metal Gear review for us here, you know what I mean?

Being able to talk to his team about it behind the scenes, sorry for the embargo, Konami, be able to sit there and talk about like what I actually thought about the game and all that stuff where then it turned into that thing where the week afterwards he through people hit me up and was like, \"Hey, like, you know, do you want to fly to LA and do this interview with him?\" And I was like, \"Oh, yeah, totally.\" Remember we, we got Anthony Cavo, we're like, \"Yeah, we'll come down and interview, we'll bring the camera.\" Great. We got there to do it and that was when I was like, \"All right, cool. When do we get to interview him?\" He's like, \"What do you, this is people like, 'What do you mean you're not going to interview him? You're here to be interviewed by him!'\" I was like,",

And like, and that the fact, I keep going back to, you know, you asked earlier, \"Do I call him Hideo?\" I do because like people call, people do the whole Kojima-san and that thing and I understand that's a sign of respect and I blah, blah, blah. For me, it doesn't feel right where I don't ever call like Spencer or Mr. Spencer, you know what I mean? Or like Pete Hines, Mr. Hines when he's through.

And the fact that Hideo Kojima and his team have consumed enough of Greg Miller content that they're still like, \"We're all in on this. We want to do all this stuff, Miller experience.\" And so it's like, \"Well, I'm going to, I'm going to just be myself 'cause if not, first off, I don't want to be disingenuous. And number two, like that's who I am and he seems to like that.\" And that, and so that interview where he interviewed me and, you know, I think if you watch that video overall, it's five, five and a half, seven minutes, something like that long. And we talked for 45 minutes until literally his people had to be like, \"Mr. Kojima, you have to stop. Like we have other people to interview. You have to keep going. You have to do all these different things.\" But in he through translation, him being",

I, you know, I want to talk to him and I, I value his opinion so much.\" And so when we got up and he hugged me, that's when I was like, \"All right, we're cool. Everything's fine. We're good. We boys.\" And so that was the thing of getting us together for RTX Sydney and like watching everybody else have that reaction to it where like, \"Yeah, RTX Sydney people like, 'We've only told them Kojima's people that Greg's coming to the, do you mind him if you don't come?'\" And I'm like, \"He's not going to care, but it's your show. Don't worry.\" And so that was the thing of us bumming around all day, **** around, joking around. He kept asking me, \"Are you all right?\" 'Cause I was so sweaty 'cause it was hot and I was walking the interviews. We're **** around, we're talking to each other. He's, you",

We're **** around, we're talking to each other. He's, you know, stopping, take photos in the street every 5 seconds. And then like when we went to rehearse the panel and like we're, rehearsal was just queuing up the videos or whatever. So we're just bullshitting around, making jokes on stage. And then when it was like a hurry up and wait situation, I looked over, I'm like, he's like, \"Yeah.\" I'm like, \"You see that Master Sword? Let's go take a photo.\" And they translate. He's like, \"Yeah.\" And we jumped up and ran over and took the photo with the Master Sword and all ****. So to jump ahead to the party, he comes in and the tenor of the room changes immediately. It was everybody's like, \"Holy **** ****, that's Hideo Kojima! I'm in the same room of him! That's awesome!\" And I've been there, but I'm so far past that, you know what I mean?

I'm like, \"All right, I'm going to go get him.\" And I just walked over, I'm like, \"You want to go play the Switch with me?\" And he's like, \"Yeah.\" We just walked over and did it because, and that's my thing is I, I think with him, and this is an interesting thing because it comes up on the panel, right?

They don't want it. But like he came out and ate the same craft services we were eating. And when uh, one of our, one, Panda Musk was with us and he's like, \"Can you get this sign for me?\" I just DM'd Hideo Kojima. I'm like, \"Hey, if you have a chance, can you come out? That panel was awesome, by the way.\" And he just came out. He's like, \"Oh, he,\" and he signed it and took, you know, great and walked back in.

Like with that, I, I wanted to uh, make sure that I had the right impression with him professionally. So your choice was just to stand there and stand? No, I mean, to be fair, it was a very quick elevator. Way better than my, like Kevin was the one that made it awkward, but Kevin's also the one that made it good.

I, I haven't talked to, to Reggie yet. You'll get it when we bring him on this show. Oh, yes, that would be fantastic. But no, man, being around Kojima was interesting. I do think the language barrier uh, is what made it really complicated for me because I would have loved to be more involved with your guys's interactions. But like, I was like, \"This is Greg's thing, totally letting him handle this.\" Well, that and that, that was why when they initially approached us about the Kojima interview, they were like, \"We, yeah, we have Kojima and he, he's down to do a panel. Do you want to host?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" And he's like, and they were like, \"Great. And we'll get other people on it.\" And I was like, \"Can we not? Can we not?\"",
