You had read it more recently. Yeah, I read it last year and it's a great book, although a divisive book and some people don't like it. But this is this is cool. This isn't the first time I don't feel like there's been a movie version of it though. No, there was a uh, did yeah, that's the one we're looking at there with Kyle MacLachlan now. Uh, that oh wait, that that's the guy from uh, Twin Peaks. Twin Peaks, right? Yeah, yeah. So he did it was him, it was Sting. Um, it had a great cast to it. The the Dune franchise as a movie franchise has been a very interest has a very interesting history. There's a great documentary called Jodorowsky's Dune. If you guys haven't seen it, you should absolutely check it out.

This includes VR with Escalation having created a number of VR projects including Please Don't Touch Anything VR, NCAA March Madness VR, and Herobound Gladiators.

Have they told you that it's not in stock? They may simply be lying to you. Fueled by a new program that discourages GameStop salespeople from selling unopened copies of video games. The program called Circle of Life gives each GameStop store different percentage quotas for one, pre-orders, two, reward card subscriptions, and three, used game sales, and four, game trade-ins. Each of these quotas is based on the store's total transactions. Pre-orders and reward card subscriptions are based on the number of transactions while used game sales and trade-ins are based on the total dollar value of transactions.

If a store's quoted for used game sales is 30% and the store sells $1,000 worth of merchandise, GameStop expects that at least $300 of the merchandise to be pre-owned. So there's how it all sets up. So if someone walks into GameStop and picks up say a brand new copy of Yakuza Zero without one, pre-ordering another game, two, subscribing for a new rewards card, three, buying a used game, or four, trading in some games to help pay for it, then the transaction will knock down all four percentages. The more new games an employee sells, the more used games they'll have to sell to make up for it.

GameStop staff have told me that corporate managers are monitoring both stores and individual employees asking everyone to get a Co score of at least 75% by hitting at least three of their four quotas. If a store is hitting their Co targets but one salesperson is not, the salesperson may face punishment or even lose their job according to company employees. Um so the story goes on and on.
