He's, of course, he gets to rest before what half of them did was just replied back to Tim and I and said, 'Here's my question.'

And I like this, 'cause I tried to dodge some of these because I knew last, we doubled up a lot last time. Not this time. Sorry. We are says, 'Just curious what the thinking was behind revealing Fallout 4 only a few months before the game launched? It seemed to have been a very popular move at a time when we see quite a few AAA games being delayed frequently after being revealed years earlier. Do you think it's a precedent other will follow?' Um, I don't know if it's a precedent. Um, as I said, as it relates to to us, uh, we try and evaluate every game based on what its needs are and how long we think um, it'll take. Um, I will tell you in general, though, and I'm I'm 98% confident in this answer that just about every dev in the world would love for the",

It stresses them out. It's a lot of work to put this stuff together. And the longer the period is, the more stuff that they're going to have to do, because you can't just announce a game X months in advance and then do nothing. You got to, you got to put some screenshots out there. You got to show some gameplay. You got to do a trailer. You got, right? You got to talk about the characters. You got to do whatever. So all of that stuff is more things that get added to their pile on top of this really hard thing of making and shipping a video game. So, um, in general, devs always like it shorter. I've done campaigns that were literally years and years long, um, and and all the way down to what we did for Shelter",

Um, and really good. I I don't know what we'll do going forward. Um, there's always this balancing act of a lot of internal things, right? The the sales guys working with retailers, setting all this stuff up, working with publishing partners in countries where where we don't distribute games. You need time to set all that stuff up and to get the word of mouth um, out there. But I would say in general, we felt like uh, you know, what we did with Fallout 4 was a success. Um, but but every game is is different and has its own needs. And as far as what other publishers might do, I I have no idea. I feel like it comes down to two, like, how much do you have to explain, right? Like, Fallout 4, cool.",

I feel like it comes down to two, like, how much do you have to explain, right? Like, Fallout 4, cool. It's Fallout 4. Awesome. Great. Whereas like Prey, all right, cool. We're doing something completely different. You need the trailers. You need us to walk you through and explain what the systems are and how this is going to shake out. That's very true. Yeah. Um, Mr. Jetton says, uh, 'How's that new Wolfenstein coming?' Uh, I Colossus. What is it? Colossus? Remember this one? You showed it in, you showed it in your little trailer. I did. Yeah. It booted up and it went through all the games and that was there. Really? It said New Colossus. Weird. Um, uh, MachineGames uh, has been hard at work on something, uh, which which I can tell you I have played is **** bananas, uh, and I can't wait to to show what it actually is and what they're actually up to. And then I'll let you know when. Okay. Okay. E3 2017. Uh, Kinda Pete says, 'Hello.'",

Uh, Kinda Pete says, 'Hello Pete.' I I assume Kinda Pete made this account to ask you this question. Okay. 'Hello Pete. Can you talk a little bit about the major differences between big titles such as Fallout and similar ones like Dishonored or Prey from a marketing perspective? Big and small only in terms of sales figures, not quality, of course.' Um, the short answer to that is there really isn't any. Like, the the our approach to every game is we have to do the best job possible to put the best foot forward for that product, uh, regard, and that that's true regardless of it's of how many sales figures. So, you know, Skyrim shipped with 20 million or whatever the hell it was over the first few months. It's not like we tried extra hard for Skyrim, but this other game over here is only 2 million. It's like, 'Ah, ****, we can just mail that.'",

It's like, 'Ah, ****, we can just mail that one in.' Like, we'll just work on that during, you know, lunch breaks and and uh, you know, happy hours and stuff. Um, that that that the way we're organized, the way my team is organized, that, you know, um, I I stand here and talk to Greg much like Todd does about the game. And it's sort of like, it ain't me doing it. I I did not do the Fallout 4 campaign. I I will go on record as saying I didn't do almost the vast majority of Fallout 4. I um, you know, that was Paris and Carlos and Ann and Matt Grandstaff and Tracy and Aaron and Steve Perkins and all these people that I have on my team who spend all this time working on these things and making up cool, fun ideas. The special videos that we did, like, that was all like Paris's thing. She she sort of pushed that and put together this great thing and it was so cool.",

Um, but the people who are working on these things, like, they put everything they have into making the thing that they're working on the best possible, because they're they're they're not working on Fallout. They're not working on Doom or whatever else. Their whole li, their whole focus is on, you know, the title that they're that they're assigned to. So we don't really half-measure it or say like, 'Well, we'll try 70% because this game's sales are are X.' Everything that we do is like, we got to make it feel like a Bethesda game, which means quality and fun and doing some things that are interesting and unique and and really bringing the essence of what the devs are making to the to the fans beforehand so they really get a sense of what the game is about.

That's something interesting too that you talked about a bit yesterday that we didn't touch on here, the fact that your devs, you make, you don't make them like you have a gun to there. You allow or you want your devs to be as involved as possible in the in our process. Yeah, absolutely. Um, and I I think I used the MachineGames guys as an example, because they had been uh, somewhere else before working with other publishers. And when we worked on the first Wolfenstein, we were talking to them about like the box or the trailers or all of this stuff. And they were like, like, 'What? What? Like, you want us to talk to you about what the box is?' We're like, 'Yeah, like, we have these ideas and designs and like, is there?' They're like, 'Yeah, like, half the time for other games we worked on, like, we found out about the box when it'",

Like, 'Okay, well, that's that's not, yeah, that's not what I would have done.' Whatever. Um, but that's part of our process is we want um, we want the devs to be involved in the process and to buy into what we're doing and to make sure that everything we're doing fits with the tone of the vibe of the game we're making, because that's really your the beginning of your interaction with any game is not when you put the disc in. It's all the stuff that you do and see around that game leading up to that. The way a Prey trailer makes you feel is part of the experience of playing Prey, because it's it's creating a tone and a vibe and for what your expectations are, which is why I was talking before about we we really don't ever do things that are",

That the website and the label on the disc and what the box looks like all ought to feed into the same kind of experience that the game itself is is providing. You put TLC into it. Use that from here a lot. There you go. Yeah. Um, Space G says, 'Hey Pete, as a young professional in entertainment PR myself, film, what advice would you give to people trying to make the transition into gaming PR/Marketing? What are the most essential characteristics, tools, or skills?' PS Prey looks amazing. Uh, thank you. Um, I I I get this question a lot. Um, the truth is, there's no sort of formulaic easy answer.

Like, how the hell would I know? I've only been at Bethesda. But in general, I I think that that um, what we tend to look for are people who are well-rounded. They're they've been involved in a lot of different things. Uh, you know, if you do PR, you didn't just do PR. You worked in a lot of different areas, whether you volunteered for stuff or um, you know, took on uh, uh, student assistant positions while you you were talking about how much you did in college, right? When I was at Wake, I was a I was a DJ at the radio station. And I uh, was the manager of the of the Macintosh Labs back when none of us had our own computers and we all went to to labs to use them. You you hip youngsters that have no idea what that is.",

I was a announcer for men's soccer games. I did women uh, women's basketball color commentary. Like, I did all this different stuff that kind of gave me insight into different areas like public speaking and writing and and and working with people, whatever it is. And I I think the more you can do to make yourself more well-rounded, it's invaluable, because, you know, if in a company like mine, those lines are blurred. Just because you're working in PR doesn't mean you need, you don't need to know about community or influencers or branding and, you know, how to come up with a a cohesive branding campaign that includes trailers, videos, right? We involve everybody in all of",

We involve everybody in all of that stuff. Um, the other thing I would say is to whatever extent possible, look for opportunities to put yourself in front of developers and publishers that might be um, signing up to be a beta tester for something and giving really good beta test notes, which by the way, 95% of people have no clue what that means. Giving beta test notes does not mean, 'Here's all of my ideas how to make your game really cool and fun.' It's a beta. They're already **** done with all of that stuff. What they're looking for is what's broken or not fun, right? Like, and writing and reproducing it. Like, 'Here's how I can reproduce how to fall through,' not like, 'You should do this and you should have this feature.' Like, devs take that stuff and crinkle it up and throw it in the trash can. They're not looking to add features in beta.",

They're not looking to add features in beta. They're they're looking for well-written, well-thought-out commentary on what's not working in their game, uh, that can be addressed. So opportunities like that are awesome. It's a great way to get yourself in front of devs. Doesn't matter if it's an indie or a big company or whatever it is. Look for those opportunities to put yourself out there in front of folks and give them a chance to recognize you for what you can do, because you'd be amazed how many times um, people notice you or that that matters. And the other thing is to keep in mind that in this day and age, video games, the people in your audience, like, but I bet most of them have grown up by and large with video games just being a thing, whereas guys like me, like, well, that wasn't really a thing until I was 11 or 12 or whatever.

And it's now become a focus of, 'That's what I want to do for a living,' which means it's highly competitive, which means you got to do stuff to set yourself apart. If you're just going to school and working on a degree to be a whether it's an animator or a marketing person or whatever, if that's all you're bringing to the table, that's that's simply not good enough. You got to take it the extra step and let your passion and enthusiasm and your desire uh, come through. I want to do do two more. Okay, you ready? Sam NW, 'What would Bethesda's strategy look like going forward in terms of studio expansion/acquisition? Are you planning expand further? Are you satisfied with the number of games that you're currently publishing?' Uh, we have no, we've never had any concrete plans for expanding. We continue to look for",

We continue to look for opportunities of studios we want to work with. But I I think covered this a little bit before, but in in general, like, we're just looking for folks that we really want to work with or that have ideas to do games and the experience of proving they can do them. That that is a good fit for us. Whether or not we acquire them is by and large almost irrelevant. I just want to put out good stuff. And uh, we look for those opportunities to do those kind of things and to and to make good stuff. But there's no like, 'Acquire three companies in three years,' or or whatever. Like, it's not really, because then what you end up doing is just acquiring people to hit a goddamn number and stable. Yeah. And then you regret it.

So you want to make sure that everything you do is to a level of quality and you're working with people who can who can do that. This is a part of the industry, a side of it that I'm ignorant about. So does it, is it as simple as a friend of a friend introduces you to somebody at GDC or at DICE? Somebody you've met before in the background comes around. It's just like, 'Hey, like, well, you're shooting the **** about what's going.' Like, 'Well, we have this idea for a game and we're we're shopping it.' Or is it very, is it very, if I'm an independent uh, developer, is it very uh, 'I book a meeting through someone and I show up and I have a PowerPoint?' And it it could be any or all of the above and a lot of flavors in between.

And he's he's great at a lot of things, including identifying talent, identifying people who have a good fit in terms of their sensibilities and approach, and identifying projects and games that are really going to going to stand out. And so a lot of it is just him keeping up with people and having conversations. And sometimes it's formal, somebody's going to come in and present the thing. And sometimes it's it's what you said, like, you bump into somebody at GDC who you haven't seen in a while, but like, 'Hey, by the way, like, we're finishing up a thing.

But they did a really, 'Messiah, is that what was? Dark Messiah?' Just go, just go the comments. Someone in their cars, listen, the NPC screaming out this game. They pulling over the side of the road and yelling at me. Um, it's been it's been a long goddamn day. Um, but they had done a number of things that we really thought were innovative and unique and different.

And then in the process of working on Dishonored, we started the conversation and they ended up coming in-house. But that was just simply him keeping up with a studio that he really liked and and we talked about and people played their games and and and looking for an opportunity. And it and it worked out great. Awesome. And then final question comes from JRV. He says or she says, 'How important do you think new IP are in the current video game market compared to both integrating popular games and reviving old dormant IP?' Uh, it depends. We good? No, you want on that answer, Mr. Hines. The blue book. It depends. And we do a little bit of everything from sort of rebooting",

And we do a little bit of everything from sort of rebooting things like a Wolfenstein that had some of the sheen off. I mean, it was this really important first of the first-person shooters, but had seen better days. That MachineGames said, 'We really want to do that and kind of bring all these things that uh, we do in our games of blending action and shooting and story and character.' Um, uh, let's see. In the case of The Evil Within, it was uh, Shinji wanting to do kind of return to the roots of survival horror. And like, 'Well, like, we don't have anything that's a fit for that. We should do a new IP.' Dishonored was the same thing. Like, Raphael and Harvey wanting to do this really grounded first-person immersive power uh, assassin fantasy stuff. Like, 'Yeah, I don't have anything that fits that. What are we going to call it? What are we going to do?' Actually, in that case, that",

What are we going to do?' Actually, in that case, that was a that was a game design that Todd Vaughn had written up that I swear was on our network like starting in '99 or 2000 when I got to Bethesda and sat there for a decade. And when he talked to Arkane, it ended up being a different, it ended up being different than the way he had written it up, but the same idea of like this assassin, 'I've been looking for you for so long. I've been waiting for you for so long.' Um, so it really just depends. It depends on who the studio is, what they want to make. Sometimes they specifically say, 'I I want to make that.' Like, in the case of Quake Champions, it was uh, not just, 'Hey, we want to do something like in the free-to-play first-person space.' It was, 'No, we want to take Quake and bring Quake to, but make it a first-person free-to-play, but stupid fast, you know, fast-paced Esports.'",

It was, 'No, we want to take Quake and bring Quake to, but make it a first-person free-to-play, but stupid fast, you know, fast-paced Esports kind of title.' So it really just depends on what's the idea and what's the fit for. And and to be quite honest, we've done a healthy amount of both over the last five years. I mean, we did Rage with id. We we rebooted Wolfenstein with MachineGames. We did new IP with Arkane. We did new IP with uh, with Tango. We we did The Elder Scrolls with ZeniMax Online, who took The Elder Scrolls and brought it into this completely different um, genre than we were used to in in online games. It it really just depends on on what's the right fit. Gotcha. Is that a better answer? Depend. Thank you. You did excellent. Thank you again. This was really fun, even the second time. Like, it still, it's one of, I mean, I honestly, I think this might be longer than the first episode. That's surprising. Yeah. But I mean, it's you're one of those guys.",
