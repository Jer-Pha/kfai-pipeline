Right, the protests are a great first step, but are the protests like the only thing that I think about is like what do people really, really give a shout about in this country, right? Yes, we care about social, but at the end of the day, what do we really care about? Basically, our wallets. How do we, how do we take all this energy and push it over to something that's actually going to affect people's at the bottom line, right? And then, then you'll start seeing some change. If the protest had shut down the airports, holy ****, that probably would have caused something, right? But they didn't. But I mean, I'm not saying we should, I'm not saying that's, that's a possibility, but but if United Airlines couldn't",

But I mean, I'm not saying we should, I'm not saying that's, that's a possibility, but but if United Airlines couldn't sell a ticket and couldn't get a person on the plane, someone somewhere would have been like, we got to, this has to change right now. And I mean, but I think that that is eventually where protest goes. We've seen many times throughout history, the protests do end up with change for the, in a positive way, and like helping our country become more what our country should be and how you should treat people morally, going back to all that stuff. I think a big problem with protest is it's really, really easy to look at it and be like, well, what's this actually doing? I mean, I'm even guilty of it myself where it's like when people are uh protesting and they shut down BART, it's a **** annoyance to me. I can't get to work. I have to replan my day.

They're disrupting all this **** for the rest of us. It's not doing anything, but it's getting coverage on the news. It's people are understanding that there is a cause that people are fighting for. I think it's the same argument as talking about advertisement. Why do people pay money for ads? Like I look at commercials and I've never bought something for commercials. Well, obviously it's doing something because commercials are a thing that will forever exist. And even though you think that you're better than it, there's millions and millions and millions of other people out there that are like, oh ****, maybe I should buy this **** vacuum or whatever the hell it is.

But it's someone else now knows about whatever cause it is. And I think that it's not that they're going to do anything, but I think that it does reach a point where hopefully the right person finds out and has a plan of action. Yeah, my, my, sorry, go ahead. The protest, I mean, for me, for the, in this instance of the immigration ban or whatever immigration executive order, right? The part for me where it made sense and why I wanted to be involved in all these different things was when they're lined up and then the detainees there, people who are landing finally are coming out and they're getting, you know, clapping or whatever and people have food for",

And then seeing that the same way too of like attorneys with signs, like if, if you know someone who's beened, come here and help. Like that's where it's like doing it, not to mention it's getting coverage, sure. But then you walk that fine line of, I don't think the, and like this is an, you know, my own uh nav, I guess, of protest. Like I'm not seeing the protest, I guess it's getting more people involved, right? I was super motivated and out trying to figure out what to do and how to help kind of thing.

On the right side, it galvanizes them against the left. It says, look at all these people who are disrupting society for this, this thing. And again, I'm, I'm playing extremes right now for just being deliberate. I absolutely agree with you. Like, yes, it's important to put your energy someplace. I'm just saying like, yeah, like to Colin's earlier point, like I look at these protests and I'm like, like I, yes, I'm 100% for them. I think people should absolutely get out there and speak their mind. But I do see that rift every time. I see that, that big like the Women's March, you just start to see that rift from the right to the left keep opening more and and giving people the opportunity to say, look at these people, like they're what a waste of energy, right?

If you're not saying something that's either this or that and you do say something in the middle, they're only going to hear the this or the that.

When people were protesting when he was inaugurated, ask 10 people what they were upset about, you get 10 different. That's not a protest, that's a **** baby's fit. And if you don't have a **** message when you go out into the streets to protest, you might as well not protest. If you're protesting 10 different things, you're not going to get any of them. Yeah, then and that's, that's unfortunate too, because you saw a lot of that, right? You saw a lot of that far right people taking all those signs and saying, look at how immature these people are.

Four years at least. You know, that's the answer to the question that we as that was posed at the beginning of the topic.
