The timing, you see what I'm saying? What what is I? You know, you know what? Great comedy's all about one timing. That's when the audio goes live, but you wait. You go three, one. Yeah, no, the audio Nick. Nick, when I say three, two, one, when **** one happens, the audio's gone live, not the video. I'm not talking about the video at all. But why do you do this then? That's to tell you, let you know the camera is actually on. Yeah, exactly. I follow you. Here's my problem. Not one of these dummies. We were high five and maybe that's our pregame ritual. Maybe that's what we do before we go on camera. You don't know. Well, just why if you waited half a second, it would have had the high five on video. That's the problem. No one knows how long it takes you to turn it on. You got to flip. You flip 15 switches. You wait till the snap till you CLI well then but",

All right, everybody, everybody, everybody, we've had a lot of fun here today. I've solved the problem. Don't worry. All right, here's what you do now, Kevin. All right, we don't need the snap. We don't need anything. You know what you do? All right guys, the mics are going live in three, two, one. Then you turn on the lights.
