Switch and IGN. The Nintendo Switch eShop purchases will be tied to a user account. Fuck yes. Now this might sound like a no shit thing. But this has been the biggest deal with Nintendo for the last decade at this point. That's an issue. They're fixing that shit. Let's get to this. Things you buy on the Nintendo Switch eShop will reportedly be associated with a user account rather than a specific piece of hardware. On current Nintendo systems you guys know how",

On current Nintendo systems you guys know how that shit works and it's not good. A NeoGAF user who received one of the new consoles early has apparently found a statement saying quote your Nintendo Account contains your Nintendo eShop purchase history and current balance. By relinking your Nintendo Account after initializing the console it will be possible to redownload any software or DLC purchased using that account. Software that has been discontinued may not be available for redownload in some cases. So it seems Nintendo has taken measures to catch up with the likes of Xbox PlayStation and Steam allowing you to download your purchases anywhere as long as you have your login details. Very smart. Good job Nintendo. Hooray. I'm very excited for Switch. Me too. And it's the brand newness sure and all that jazz. It's that newness.",

And interesting do you think that's part of the reason it was canceled? I wouldn't say. Holy shit I made that joke just reading the text and not even seeing. That's hilarious. The project which was apparently codenamed DarkSide was in development at God of War studio Sony Santa Monica. The game was canceled in 2014 after a round of layoffs at the company and had apparently been in development since God of War 3. It remains unclear why the project was canceled.

That happens more often than not on most stuff because there's so many games that come out that we just get emails that are like hey, don't talk about this until February 2nd or whatever the hell it is. And then the bigger stuff is when there's more and more red tape, more and more regulations, and then things switch it up. Yeah, I mean, obviously, everybody's talking about different games. It's interesting when I talk about the embargoes that I'm under, people start jumping around and thinking that we have games that are way out still. But then there are games, but I don't know. Yeah.

Disneyland and Disney World, it's the strictest place in the world when it comes to stuff. You're going to get caught and stopped so fast. But man, Greg, there's no way I'd rather go out than attempting a siege at the Disney World castle. Sure. With just a fucking mob of people wearing Kinda Funny shirts. That'd be awesome. We'd make the news. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God, it'd be great. Yeah, we might also get banned for life. And that's some shit we don't want to miss.

We need to go one day have our good friend James Burke give us the best fucking tour in the world. The Burke Experience. Mm-hmm. It's muy bueno.

So I'm way behind on the new run of it, but I liked where they were through issue three maybe or whatever. Regularly, as we've talked about a million times, I keep up more regularly I think with Image and stuff like that. You know, like Saga on top of Walking Dead, Invincible now that they started the final 1 of that on top of that. I like all the Superman stuff happening right now with his son. Action and Superman themselves I still think are trashy books. They're just like, why are you doing this? Sometimes they are, holy shit, this is one of the best Superman comics I've ever read.

An imposter apparently posing as R&B singer SisQo has been hitting New York Fashion Week shows, sitting front row, posing for photographers, and charming his way into fashion parties. The fake SisQo sat front row at the Philip P... I don't know, Fashion People, where he sported a black velvet, gold trimmed, coffin style Versace suit, a torrent of chunky jewelry and shades. Hitting the shows with his quote-unquote assistant, he also attended Kanye West's presentation. What the fuck?

He denied posing as the singer, but refused to clarify who he actually is, denying his last name was Barnes. The real SisQo, who's currently in Las Vegas on tour, is also the case...
