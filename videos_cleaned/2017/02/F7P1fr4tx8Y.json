We've just traveled a lot around the world. Tell you, it's pretty great to come in for a 3-day week 'cause we did the Australia trip. We went to RTX Australia. Or Sydney. Thank you to everybody who came out. You were an amazing audience. You're amazing kids.

It's Thursday already. Here's a question I I have that I've always wanted to ask you. Are you close enough to uh Mr. Kojima to call him Hideo? I do. So you when you when you see him across you see him across the the crowd, you go, well, I don't I mean, I don't like I don't say like I'm falling off a cliff. How you doing? Good to see you. No, Kojima is going to be his own topic today. Oh, so save it. Is he? Save that topic. Yeah, let's save. Is Nick here the whole time? The whole show? Oh my God, yeah. I'm sorry.

We're not talking about Hideo yet. Good's later. That's topic three. Uh, recently I just finished Inside. I played Journey and now I'm playing Hitman. So you finally did big jump. Yeah, yeah. I don't know why. I think I I just I've I've always liked Hitman as a series. Um, traditionally I've played that game the complete polar opposite of how you're supposed to play it. I think the last time I played was either Hitman 2 or Hitman: Blood Money. I think it was Hitman 2, which I think was on PS2. I want to say that the last time I actually went through it.

And like Diana would come on and be like, hey, FYI, not the way you're supposed to play this game, Agent 47. Um, but I'm digging it. If you guys haven't played it, you should give it a chance. It's a it's a like if if you like Hitman, if you're a fan of the series, this is like the best. Get here. Here's the thing though, is I don't I what's been interesting about Hitman is that everybody who sees it and goes, oh, that looks interesting and plays it seems to fall in love with it. And there's you of course, but you said if you're a fan of the series, I'm thinking Steve Gaynor who played it, loved it, talks about it all the time.

Like she's super in love with it. What about it speaks to you that grabs you like that? 'Cause you're not, you know, we're joking around, but you're not the video game guy that we are that wants to go home and plays all these different things. Yeah, I just I really like the style of it honestly. I like the I like the uh the the music in it is fantastic. It really drag like pulls you into the environment. Um, the the just the sheer volume of NPCs they have is really really cool. So you actually feel like these areas are really populated.

Does it be because I've I've played the demo at a few events, I think, and I I have the retail version. I just haven't jumped on to play with it. Uh, is it obviously beating you the head? 'Cause that was always the one thing about certain Hitman I played. It's like, oh, we have this giant room. You walk in. It's like giant **** flashing things of like, well, if I cane the okay. No, I mean this. Um, it feels organic that you're making it feels pretty organic. It feel there is a little bit of a learning curve, which is good. So you're like, okay, well, maybe I instead of 'cause this is how I played the first the first area, which is uh in Paris. It's that fashion show they showed a bunch of times.

And I would get in shootout after shootout and they and you just get punished for that. You can only take like two hits before you're dead. Um, so it really does force you to kind of think outside the box, even though you're in kind of a sandbox. Um, and you have to actually just you get rewarded for roaming around and discovering stuff, which is cool. So you get rewarded for like figuring out which costume get you to the right area and listening to people's conversations and picking up those clues that aren't the hardest thing on the planet to pick up. Of course, it's they're not they're not, but they're not beating you over the head with it. And so you do have to sort of I I like any game or any experience that that you can't just that",

Um, having said that, the last two missions I I did beat by just happenstance walking by the target. The target just walked in front of me and I just hit him and then ran. Nice. So, you know, there is that. Um, are do you feel inclined to replay those missions? That's the thing with Erin is that Erin has been playing it like crazy, at least when Colin was originally talking about it, but she wasn't playing anything but Paris, right? She would play Paris and beat it one way and play it again and see if she could do this way. And I do because there's like there's I don't know how many different combinations there are, but with Paris for instance, um, you can you track down one sort of uh angle that you're that you're one story that trying to",

Like uh Paris, I think the one that I did was like there's a there's you look exactly like the the lead fashion model and the person you're supposed to kill is having a is having a meeting with that person later. So you have to figure out how to take that person out, pose as them, get your makeup done and go through. And it's really really cool. But there's other ways to do it too. There's other people that are having meetings with her at the same time. Um, or you could just try to sneak upstairs, but you have to then like take out guards, cameras, either take out guards, take out cameras, or you have to drop all your **** because you get frisked.

Gotcha. This game's release distribution plan was very interesting, unique. So yeah, it came out episodically over the last year. This you're now playing The Definitive Edition that came out on the PlayStation 4, right? I believe it's just it's the first quote season, right? Yeah, like so you're playing through that and they kind of like we we when we hosted the GameStop Manager, wait, was that? Yeah, GameStop Manager. We did the Square Enix thing. And so we like we briefed on this and how they learned as they were going through the episodes on how to change stuff.

Does it feel like a complete game when you're playing through or does it feel like separate episodes that are just kind of attached to? That's my kind of my only critique with the game is that it does feel a little disjointed. You're getting story, you're getting cinematic moments in between each one of these episodes. Um, and it's playing toward a larger overarching story, but I'm I'm I'm not as invested in honestly, to be honest, as I am in going back and playing those missions 'cause it's so much fun. That's the thing is I don't know how much that matters to people 'cause it seems like that's the deal. Same thing with their high value targets. Like they not only did they do the episodic stuff, they gave you a reason to come back over and over and over again. That's a platform, which we always talk about like, make don't make a game, make a platform. And that was",

But what is it? Every do you know every few weeks or something they release a new Elusive Target or something for you to go. So it was like a reason to keep playing it. Oh, you talking about the targets that just pop up and you have only a specific amount of time to go get them? Yeah, well, they did special like we know Gary Busey was a target for different things like that. And they release that and the whole Sarajevo Six business. Whatever, it doesn't matter. But I mean, they were giving you a reason to replay the same stuff over. It's cool. Yeah, and again, it's like, you know, it's it's uh there's there's any which way to go about some of these missions. So that's it's it does incentivize you to go back and replay. I mean, there's",

So that's it's it does incentivize you to go back and replay. I mean, there's there's small stuff that that I think could add to the immersion of it. Like I think like for instance, one of my only small pet peeves is like I've been to Marrakesh and so when you're walking around, you're hearing nothing but American accents. You're like, that's a little weird. Like everyone you're bumping into people like, hey buddy, watch out. I'm like, that's not that's not sounds like. Um, and same with like Paris. It's like they I don't think they went. Yeah, they you hear a lot of that. You you heard sort of a lot of the same that voice acting. So that that takes you out of it a little bit. But then you're kind of you're drawing right back in when someone's like, hey, this this person's favorite drink is this and uh he really wants to know how to make that. I think the recipe in the basement. You're",

He he gets sick and then you drown him in the **** toilet. You come up and he drinks it and you just like bash the glass, take the corkscrew, jab it in his jugular. Yeah, so we do always talk about games as a platform and kind of embracing that. But I think that when this game was first announced and like I remember when I played a demo of it at one of the events, I was kind of uh I went into it with some preconceived thoughts of like, oh, because this is being released episodically, it's less then like I kind of went into it imagining that it wasn't as important as a true Hitman game would be.

Well, that that was the thing with Giant Bomb and I'm pretty sure I'm right on this because Hitman keeps coming up because this is the thing where episodic is so fascinating in the way that when we talk about video games, right? And we're talking about AAA games, whatever. We're talking about how Watch Dogs is this outlier right now that is charting even though it's been out months. That's bizarre. You know what I mean? Episodic is such a great idea in the way that you are constantly part of the conversation. You know, Walking Dead Season 3, we're were just talking about today in the Morning Show. I can't wait for Episode Three. And so it goes from being this thing drops and there's a week before and a week after that",

And Hitman's been such a brilliant burn on it where the way it was explained to me by I think either Dan Ryckert or some of our best friends who are also Giant Bomb Giant Bomb fans is the fact that one of them loved it. It might have been Dan or I can't remember Vinny loved it. And then one by one won everybody over until yeah, like everybody was in on there by the end of the year. H yeah, I mean, it's super fun. My my take on it though is I don't I I saw it obviously we went to the panels. We we we we met those guy the developers and all that stuff.

And I of course waited until all of them were ready and I can it. Well, what's interesting about it for me is when we or yeah, when we went to the event where we first got to play it downtown. And this is like right after we became Kinda Funny. Remember that? We went out drinking with the Life Is Strange folks afterwards. Uh, I remember playing it and for me feeling me butting up against the rules of the game and getting frustrated because it's a demo. I'm there. I've 30. There's somebody behind me lined up.
