But the way it usually goes is how how the show works is by about 15 minutes in, 'cause they keep talking about video games, I just do this, right? And then sometimes I just take a little nap, little nap, little sleepy-peepy. Uh, welcome to the Kinda Funny Morning Show, everyone. I'm your host, Nick Scarpino.

I only was able to watch like half of it last night, uh, 'cause I usually doze off because I'm an old man. I fall asleep through movies. So, uh, I know. I can't even get through one episode of Star Trek these days, though. Honestly, it's like right when Spock starts talking, he's like, \"Captain, that is an illogical statement.\" I just start like, oh, man. Although I will tell you this, Spock, by far the sexiest of all the people on the crew. He just held that **** together, man.

I've watched now almost all three seasons of the original Star Trek, and I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov are super sleazy. They are ****, dude. If I saw a dude do that at work, I would pull him aside and be like, \"You can't talk like that to people. You can't be like inappropriately just randomly touching women.\" Yeah, because they're quote unquote, \"women.\" Like, \"Oh, it's so cute.\" Like that always the thing. Like, \"It's so cute. You're trying to figure this out, but you're a woman.\" Oh, yeah. It's it's it's so **** up, so dated. It's so misogynistic. And that's me saying this.

Uh, I believe it was 70s, right? The 70s. I it doesn't matter. Uh, either way, it was it's just so completely inappropriate. I watched one episode last night where Scotty was basically like they just introduced this new character that that they were trying to like it was her first time uh, like it was their first Tour of Duty. And Scotty's just totally hitting on her the entire time. And she's like, the role is not the girl supposed to be into it.

And then Spock's like, \"That's illogical to talk like that.\" Somebody needs to every seven years have touch with me. What you said, Nick, you said inappropriate touching from your boss in the office is normal and expected. It is now these days. But back then, what I'm saying is they weren't as liberal as we are. They weren't as free as we are. See, when I walk up to you and when no one's looking in your tiny little room and I just squeeze a part of your body and I make this sound, that's normal.

Moonlight, Manchester by the Sea, Lion, Hidden Figures, Hell or High Water, Hacksaw Ridge, Fences, and Arrival. All phenomenal movies. Any other year, I think, would really really win.

But supposedly the word on the street is that there's going to be a big update. Uh, but like everyone's running into it. Even like mentions like Jose from let's read this. Uh, he even mentioned that he was having some issues within he was playing. Interesting. Like, yeah, yeah, we get it. You work at IGN.
