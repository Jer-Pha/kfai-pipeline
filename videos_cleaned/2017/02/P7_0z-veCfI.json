Uh, my topic is about the current state of uh, of streaming video and like SVOD things like that right now. You know, every day I read a story about uh, a new either MCN or you know, company like making a some sort of either new app or new SVOD service that's that's uh, is what is SVOD? Streaming video on demand. So basically like subscription, subscription video, excuse me, that streaming video. Um, but it is, yeah. Um, sorry, I didn't know you had two topics this week. God.",

Um, sorry, I didn't know you had two topics this week. God. Nick, my bad, my bad. Um, and again, not not calling these people out at all, but this is just the most recent one that I read today, which was at Fullscreen. Uh, $5.99 monthly SVOD Service arrived yesterday on Amazon Channels and on feature, a launched in 2015 for Amazon Prime members who can purchase subscriptions to programs, to programming from uh, from likes of HBO, ceso, Machinima, PBS Kids, and roughly 80 other channels. So it's all, you know, that I get confused like an old person trying to figure out how a phone works, right? Um, this is even more confusing to me because what this is is you already have an Amazon Prime subscription, right? M. You're also adding on top of that $5.99 to have a subscription to the Fullscreen network, which is getting you uh, premium content from all their big YouTube Stars.",

You're also adding on top of that $5.99 to have a subscription to the Fullscreen network, which is getting you uh, premium content from all their big YouTube Stars, right? Stars that started on another platform that are now going to this platform. So it's all getting very confusing. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. I just wanted to see where your guys's heads were with everything and if you can wrap your brains around all this, because what Amazon is doing is very interesting. It's it's almost like a Comcast cable. Well, that's what it is. I mean, so we've talked about this topic in in roundabout ways many times over the years, but I think that uh, what you're specific specifically talking about now is the fact that it is 2017 and it's no longer uh, can you cut cable? Are you going to cut cable? There's Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime. Now it's there's those three things, plus you can just get this channel, you can get this channel, you can get this group of people.",

Now it's there's those three things, plus you can just get this channel, you can get this channel, you can get this group of people. There's all these different services and packages and it's more um, more of an option than ever to totally cut cable and get all the things that you want, right? But it is real \u00e0 la carte pick and choose. You need a little bit of this, a little bit of that. So what I think is happening is with Amazon Prime and all that, it is every single of the huge conglomerates are just adding on more packages that you can just add on to their to their things. Like, do you use Amazon Prime a lot? I use Amazon Prime. I don't use the video service. Okay. I started using it more just more more because of course I'm addicted to browsing through things and never actually watching any of them. And time out, I don't know if you caught this, Unsolved Mysteries on there now. **** awesome, man. Robert Stack. There it is. Good evening.",

Robert Stack. There it is. Good evening. So there there's lots of there's a lot of stuff that pops up and and and so I add it to the queue and then when I go to watch it, it's like um, like Indie documentaries, Indie movies, things like that that say Amazon Prime, but you go to watch it and it says, no, you need to have a subscription, a subscription. It's not even Starz. It's like small obscure like the Indie Channel, like or the Indie movies subscription. It's $5.99. So slowly but surely, if I added all these in, I would get to the point where I had a cable bill again, which is crazy. But I mean, but the difference is that money is directly funding the content and I think that that that's a very important distinction to make. Like, for example, a lot of these services come to us and talk to us and they're like, hey, do you want to get Kinda Funny?",

Well, yeah, I mean, I mean, obviously the money doesn't just go 100% to the creators, but it's like, I'm I'm sure more goes to the creators than um, cable would give to to creators. And it's also the the gateways are open for people to be able to that. And in addition to that, a lot of the the platforms fund content to be made. Like Fullscreen, for example, would fund creators to make projects that are exclusive. So it's like they're getting money to make things that that is where the money is going. So that is why the $5 subscription. It's what we do on Patreon, but it's more of a condensed service. So it gets complicated when",

You need to have the Rooster Teeth First thing. But then also they're going to have some exclusive stuff on Verve or on whatever. So it gets, but that's just the world we live in now where it's just like, you need to pay for what you want instead of paying for everything you don't want and just, you know, watching TV as it's on. But are you still, but on a meta level, aren't you still, isn't that sort of replicating the old system that necessarily didn't work? Like you're still like, so you're paying for Fullscreen, right? But but and again, not calling out Fullscreen, this is just the most recent example. I'm sure their app's fine. Um, but you're paying for that, but you're",

You're also getting 15 other pieces of content of channels that you may not have subscribed to, right? Isn't aren't we just? My worry is that we're recreating the the old system that didn't work. Sure. That that that we're trying to put out of business and we're just putting that in like, we're basically just **** over Comcast and saying like, well, we're gonna we're going to do the exact same thing, but just not through Comcast. I mean, I think the difference there though is that it you can ever you can then delete the things you don't want, so they're not there.

For example, Crunchyroll and Funimation, two of the big leading uh, companies in terms of anime distribution and streaming and whatever. Them joining together and joining forces, it's not going to be an overnight thing, but once that actually becomes a full-on deal where it's like, it is just one thing and they are one company, it's like that could be awesome because then all the anime stuff's in one place, right? And I think that that is going to make things better instead of having to have subscription services to each one of those, right? That can't happen until each one is funded a certain amount to be able to have the infrastructure and understanding of what it means to be a streaming service versus a distribution service, you know, and have",

Like there's all these like weird semantics that I think everyone's trying to figure out at the same time. And obviously there's a lot of money to be made. So it's like, I think that everyone's realizing that with Comcast, you either have com, if you're in the Bay Area, you either have Comcast or you have AT&T. And that's the only options for for cable. I think with all these different subscription services, it's a bunch of content creators like us being like, why not be everywhere? You know, we're a bit more focused on, well, we have Patreon and that's what we want to focus on and we want to kind of, but see, but that's a that's a great example, right?

You're you're going straight there. Um, just for that specific thing. But my question is, does it start to get a little bit murky when their content and our content and someone else's content that no one's ever heard of is on that? Obviously in the Crunchyroll example, right? Where variety is a good thing. But my, I guess my base question is, when does that stop and when does too much variety become a bad thing, right?

I realized like to get in, to get ESPN and to get HBO and to get the and AMC, like the things that would matter to me, even if I was just buying them off of iTunes the next day, like you're talking about with B, you know what I mean? Like you quickly run that and you're like, well, ****, it's going to be really close to a cable bill already because our cable bill, the least expensive part of it's the cable, it's the internet that cost so much, you know what I mean? Yeah. And so that's the big question of like, how do you balance it? How do you juggle and do it?

I thought it was pretty dope when it came out and they were talking about it. I was like, this is going to be a bunch of ****, blah, blah. The amount of times I've been on the road and yes, something I want on my DVR is there and I open up my app and I I download it to the app and I watch it on a plane. Now, the number of times I try that, it's like, can't do it right now. And I have to like do it four or five times and it works great. But I mean, still, we're light years ahead of where I thought I'd be. The amount of times we're out, I'll be out and somebody like the XFL is a great example. Like we were on our way to Sydney and people are like, oh man, it's, you know, it's F. I open up my phone, pinged over to my cable box, said record it. It recorded it on the hotel Wi-Fi, downloaded, you know what I mean? Like jump",

Like that that's awesome. And for me, that alleviated a lot of it in the fact that suddenly the only way Comcast could get better for me right now on a cable provider, obviously I want cheaper, faster internet all the time and I want to be super stable and blah, blah. Uh, would be the fact that they had a PlayStation or Xbox app where I could watch it because there's just those few times where it is, I'm in bed, Colin's in the living room playing a game or whatever and I want to watch Supergirl or Walking Dead or whatever and it's on the DVR, but I don't watch on my iPad. I want to put it to the TV and I don't want to **** get a dongle and do this. I mean, that's a huge issue we're running into as well.",

It's uh, we run into issues when we have so many devices and those apps aren't available on all devices. So you really do need there there has to be a bunch of different options based on stupid licensing and stupid tech stuff. They can't have this app on this system for whatever **** reason, right? Like not being able to watch HBO on PS4, which I heard they fixed now. But like, but still, there's all these like weird ass issues that it's like, I don't know why that's for somebody when Day 5 premiered. I was like, oh ****, Day 5 sounded awesome. I can't wait to watch it. And I jumped on YouTube on my PS4 and it's not there. It's oh, it's RT. Okay, great. There's no PlayStation 4 Rooster Teeth app. Of course not.

I'm just watching on my computer on my laptop while I eat dinner at the table. And that's the thing. And again, now Rooster Teeth does have an app on Xbox, doesn't have one on PlayStation. So it's like, if you have an Xbox, get your head out of your ass. That's when there's the the problem lies. Like last night, for example, uh, Gia wanted to watch The Bachelor and that's on ABC. So I was like, all right, cool. If if I any of my devices have an ABC app, I'll be able to log in using someone's Comcast and be able to watch this ****, right? None of them ABC app. Like, how does ABC not have an app on either my Smart TV, the Xbox One, my PlayStation 4, Wii U? Like none of this. I think we all know why. I'm not in Wii U.

I'm not in Wii U. Like I just I come like this is it's insane to me that like that a something like ABC, it has an app on a phone and an iPad, but not on any of these other services. But that's where we're at where it's like, we do have there's Hulu and there's Netflix or there's CBS or all these other channels and AMC has its thing, but it's only available in certain places. And so you start use PlayStation Vue, right? So that's thing is I I subscribed for a free trial for PlayStation Vue, which forever has just been like a joke. I'm like, who the **** would want to do this? And really, it's just cable. You just use your PlayStation. So it's just like, it's live TV and you can DVR and all that stuff. And I tried it. I'm like, I'm surprised by uh, how cheap it is for what you get from it. But again, it's another thing of you're just adding.",

Fascinating. So I think the big thing we have to keep in mind is it's the same argument I make with persistent online games and mult and MMOs or whatever is that there's only so many competitors that can survive. And and eventually that eventually and it's not many. Like half the things like almost all the VOD things that are coming off YouTube, not going to survive. A lot of these smaller things that are that are happen, you know, are not going to survive. Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu suck up so much of the oxygen. Just like World of Warcraft and uh, Call of Duty and all these things suck up all of the energy in The Division out of all, you know, out of all the.",

It kills. And the same thing is going to happen here. Um, I think the \u00e0 la carte approach is interesting. I think the bigger tangential thing we have to keep an eye on is what happens with net neutrality, which can destroy this. Um, and uh, what happen, you know, even with with Comcast one terabyte limits. Now Comcast is totally fighting fire with fire, which I respect from a corporate level because they are looking at they being like, we're ****. Like ultimately, you know, 5G and future technologies are not even going to require uh, wired internet at all. So that's going to cut them out. And then you don't want your TV and your phone service already. So now they're out, which is why they merge with NBCUniversal and stuff. They make themselves relevant and uh,",

So there's a lot of like tangential **** that is very important in this conversation. But it is it is the same as any market. There only there's only so much oxygen for these things. Netflix and Amazon Prime are not going anywhere. I think Amazon Prime is actually the best value out of all of them. Um, and um, that people are gonna have to get used to. I think the idea I talk about this a little bit in Colin Was Right this week and I haven't recorded it yet, but by the time you see this, you would have would have already been live.

And we have to be very careful about about um, our our this kind of knowledge that we deserve things for as low a price as possible or for free. And I think what we're going to end up coming to the future and we already see this with Showtime, we see this with Starz, we see this with HBO, is is the \u00e0 la carte purchases along with these kind of $8.99, $9.99, maybe $19.99 one day kind of all-encompassing services and then the supplemental individual uh, \u00e0 la carte purchase of individual shows.

Well, that's why I love that's the only thing keeping cable relevant. Can't get things the day or the moment it comes out. Exactly. But the big thing is the confluence of all those factors along with how many people are still expecting things for free. The fact is that people that are buying or paying for even music, um, it was only two years ago that digital music sales had surpassed physical music sales. Um, so we have to be a little more patient on this uh, on this front, I think. But it's a, in other words, it's a very multi-tiered kind of thing.

It well, most of it's not free, but you can literally buy anything. The fact that Netflix silos you and doesn't like, like if I were Netflix, I'd be like, we have to chase everything as soon as possible. And if we have to charge for it, we should. But like, if if a person is looking for movie X, Y, and Z and they only have movie X and Y and Z aren't available at all, why don't we give them the option to buy it? Because people are becoming more and more comfortable doing those kinds of things. So combining those kinds of things, I think is",

But that you're you're making the same point I was trying to say where it's just like, I do think that all the little guys are doing things different than Hulu and Netflix and whatever. And they need to do those different things and see what works and what fails and then kind of combine and just keep going. Talk about with like Crunchyroll and Funimation, all that. And I do think that eventually the the top dogs are going to at some point get that converge and merge at some point. But I think that that is a good thing. I think that eventually we're going to get to a really good place. And I think that all the little dudes are important. And interesting stats are the you think like, oh, Hulu.",
