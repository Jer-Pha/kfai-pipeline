Specifically, I want to talk about what it needs to do to succeed in the market that we have going right now. Now that we know what the Switch looks like, now that we know where the PS4 Pro falls. Yeah. What does Microsoft need to do to market this thing correctly? What do we think that they'll do and and all of that. This kind of jumps off um as the day that we're recording this, there was a whole bunch of leaked things of uh Digital Foundry Digital Foundry. Oh yeah, the teraflops and all all that stuff, but that on the morning show you and Nick kind of watched the original pitch video from last year's E3 uh where they announced the the Scorpio and talking about it and uh I have I heard it just from the other room, but it was like there was a lot of things being said.

I was like, man, I don't I don't even remember them saying that. M. So, it's kind of the jumping off point. Yeah. Well, I mean, for me it stems from because this isn't about the news. The news is out there. We're going to reference a bunch of it, but for me it was I don't think the Scorpio were going to get shown at E3 and then supposedly released in holiday 2017 is going to be what they pitched anymore. I think they're going to change course on this and I think they're going to change course on it because of what's happened with PlayStation 4 Pro. Cuz what you're talking what the the news today, right, was uh twofold and not and not necessarily related. I'm not because it's a NeoGAF thread where a one of the developers of Ori and the Blind Forest chimed in and then it was Digital Foundry dropping these white papers or whatever",

You read all this stuff today. Uh well, I saw the the uh the Digital Foundry story and then I saw the uh the post on on NeoGAF that was then turned into a story or whatever. Exactly. So, the whole Digital Foundry thing here is these white pages, right, which is the the document they gave to the developers or whatever talking about this. What's important is that it was dated just after the Scorpio's E3 reveal. So, I think this what they're talking about here is still based on what happened there and like here's what we think we are. Here's what the market we think we are. And I think they probably changed because what I've always thought is the most enticing argument made and this is I think Colin probably coined it right after E3 and we were all talking about it and all thinking",

Colin put it really succinctly, right? Is the fact that they've lost this generation. Xbox One has lost a PlayStation 4. Xbox One has fantastic games. It's sold really well, but when you compare it to a juggernaut of PlayStation 4, they can't make up that ground. And so they have to concede the ground as Colin said and move on to something else. And that's what Scorpio gets to be. And so when they started talking about it, it really did sound and that's what this whole document is right after the fact. It sounded interesting. But here they're talking about the fact that again it's, you know, not they're talking about not running it in native 4K necessarily. There's references to it, right? But it's talking about how to, you know, this is all so technical and above my head and",

But they're talking about upsample this the the six teraflops of course stuff. The second major technique it advocates is sparse rendering, which is better known in the post PS4 Pro era as checkerboarding, doing the same thing, right? So, not only does Microsoft advocate the same technique for Scorpio, it also cites the same impressive work Ubisoft did in Rainbow Six, which to the point where it's the exact same presentation shown to me, the reporter for Digital Foundry by Mark Cerny a few months uh back is referenced in the white paper. So, it's one of those things where the a lot of people took this report today and were like, \"Fuck Scorpio. It is just the PlayStation 4 Pro, a little bit more powerful, but it's doing the",

I thought when you take that into the context of this is where we were at E3 and then the comment of from uh Thomas Mahler who was worked on Ori and the Blind Forest on NeoGAF where on NeoGAF Windforce asked is Scorpio is Scorpio their PS4 Pro or a new generation? I'm super confused. Uh Thomas said all consoles are now x86 PCs and the architecture will remain the same. That's why Sony was able to quickly iterate on the PS4 and make a beefier version of it. Scorpio is a Next-Gen machine with the added benefit that all of your old games will still be compatible. From this point on, similar to PCs, you'll not lose your library when you buy a Next-Gen system. I guess since NeoGAF is confused, Microsoft will need to do a little work to make it clear to",

So, yeah, we I'm sorry, PS4 Pro, but a full-blown Next-Gen machine that's not just backwards compatible with your current library. This then got us into the conversation on the morning show about the fact that and this is an E3 conversation we had that how is the Xbox Scorpio going to run all your Xbox One games? But they made a big point at E3 that any you know you can play the Scorpio game the games we're putting out are on both consoles and there's all these different things and it's this ecosystem. It's this family of Xbox where you can play everything and it's like well then what the point is the Scorp the **** Scorpio which again is what's the point of PlayStation 4 Pro",

We're uprising to 4K and doing all the different things. I'm making the hypothesis today on the Gamescast that this is what they thought the Scorpio was going to be and that that what they were moving forward. Then they saw the reaction of the Pro and they saw how excited people were about what they thought the Scorpio was going to be and that they're changing the Scorpio to be the Next-Gen machine that Thomas Mahler is talking about now. The reason behind what we've been saying for a long reason behind that is the fact I thought this is interesting too. This is from the Know Video over on Rooster Teeth they were talking about or you know channel I don't know it's Rooster Teeth property.

That's what how they were describing the Scorpio. Since then, it's been changed. Now, she was using this to key in on the 4K gaming, but maybe that's not really true. Maybe it's just like the Pro. I think there's more it's much more interesting here in terms of this. Now it says, \"The most powerful console ever, featuring 6 teraflops of graphical processing power, true 4K gaming, and compatibility with Xbox One games and accessories.\" For me, it's that last line, compatibility with Xbox One games and accessories.

It is not Xbox One's not going to be forwards compatible with this. That's not what we're getting into. I also thought it was interesting they dropped high fidelity VR from it. That I know that's been the thing back and forth Oculus that blah blah blah, but that's not where they're going anymore, right? They're talking about the most powerful console ever. Six teraflops of graphical processing power, true 4K gaming, and compatibility with Xbox One. Yeah. I mean, this this all adds up.

Uh I mean, if anything, it's like, does it even come out early next year or does it not come out until end of 2018? I think that's the most likely uh thing that we we If it's 2018 if it's end of 2018, it's a full year delayed, then I think it's exactly what we're talking about here, where this was what it was going to be and they saw the reaction of Pro and they were like, \"Nope, we can't do that.\" And this again, it goes back to to what I've been saying forever about the PS4 Pro and with the the Xbox One S where it's just like those are the new versions of the same system that give different functionality to people that want it.

Uh PS4 Pros for are for enthusiasts that want uh to have the option to have the higher frame rates or better resolution or whatever going for them. But like Scorpio is a totally different beast. And for them to even pretend like all the system, all the games are going to be backwards and forwards compatible, it's like that just doesn't make sense uh for how people buy games and how consoles work and all that.

I think that there will be Scorpio games and um it is just going to be that that move on. There will be ports. It it's going to be just like we've seen for the last Well, yeah. Because I I mean I think and I think that's what they realize, right? Cuz I think that's the whole thing, especially from Microsoft's corner. We're talking about what Scorpio needs to do, right? To be to matter and to matter, it needs to be their next system. It cannot be iteration. It cannot be a little bit better because PlayStation had trouble with that",

And not not including when we Skype call with it or do whatever with it to actually play exclusives and play things that I can't get on PlayStation or somewhere else. Why would I ever jump the why would I give them more money to do that, right? But if it was the fact of, okay, cool. It plays all your old Xbox One games. So, I'll get any exclusive that comes to Xbox One. But it's also going to give you for the next 1 to 18 months games that are only on Scorpio until there's a PlayStation 5, until there's like this thing. That's where it gets fascinating.

It's just like that's just ridiculous. But that is exactly what seems to be happening here. I think it's I think it's complicated. Um I think when they they announced Scorpio, I think that there was probably they were announcing an idea. Um and they probably and I'm sure Microsoft's a big company, R&D, lots of different things. They probably had multiple consoles and they they were trying to figure out and which way to go forward understanding that their competition was planning something what might be similar, might not be similar. Um I think it is fairly obvious that PlayStation 4 Pro has not lit the world on fire. Um the only evidence you",

So, um, the first time I had ever seen anyone from Sony talk about it was some random guy in Singapore saying how they're trying to manufacture more of them, but from what I've been told from multiple people, they're on storeshelves wherever you go. So, it's not like that the thing's rare. So, this is a niche device for a wider audience of 55 million or so group of people that own PlayStation 4. And I think Microsoft looks at this in in in in a different way, which is the Scorpio, I agree, is uh the Scorpio as an incremental step is a mistake because Xbox is already losing. So now you're dealing with a much smaller group of people. I mean, the latest estimate I saw was maybe 6 million Xbox Ones in a while, which means that they're losing by",

I mean, the latest estimate I saw was maybe 6 million Xbox Ones in a while, which means that they're losing by more than to1 to PlayStation, which is bad. Um, now, 6 million units is very respectable. That puts it in the same league as the original Xbox. That puts it in the same league as GameCube and and they will still sell millions more. So it'll it'll end up in the 30s. will probably end up around or past N64, which is fine um on that kind of pantheon of of consoles sold. But I think that they probably chose a path. And I think that there's multiple reasons why they probably chose it. I think one is that when they were talking about the idea of Scorpio, when they were talking about what was going to be and what it can do, my assumption is that they were aiming for a late 2017 release in the hopes that a lot of the components would become cheaper because the rumors were when um when people were",

Um and the other thing is that and and it you know as we talked about not necessarily unique idea but that they they they lost and it's time to kind of move on. The thing that I'm concerned about for them and the thing that I think is going to start getting super muddled and maybe it's just my organizational OCD mind is that now the generations are just totally **** up because now Switch is coming out in a month. Uh PS4 has been out since 2013. Xbox One has been out since 2013. PS4 Pro is just an incremental device. Scorpio sounds like it's going to be a",

I believe the person who has this clearly is you know the people at Moon Studios or whatever that's what the studio is called, right? That made those people are in the second party. They have they have the device I'm sure. And this is the current information, right? Exactly. So I I totally deferred to him and it's and he's being very it's not it's not ky it's not it's not ambiguous or nebulous at all. He's saying it's a new console. It's a new generation. It is a backwards compatible system. So what I think is going to happen is akin to what you were saying is let's say that there there's a new Halo game next year or something like that. It'll be on both consoles and it'll be similar to the PS4 and PS3 jump when",

And then they're gonna and this that will be done specifically because that doesn't need to be done because the Scorpio it will be backwards compatible but it has to be done because of the way they communicated what the console was going to be and they did say straight up this thing is just an continuation of Xbox One in so many words and the games will all be available on it but that's not possible because to your point what is the point then of doing this at all. It's just gonna you're always going to be held back by the lowest common denominator, which is why the PS4 Pro makes no sense and why I think Microsoft is seeing that and and seeing like this is a new push.

And probably they probably go way down the rabbit hole and make it backwards compatible with everything at least digitally and that Sony has done on the PlayStation Network for instance. So PS1 why why can't you play PS1 classics on the PS4? No one **** knows. And I'm sure that",

But if Sony now has a chance as the winner of this generation to look at what Microsoft's doing and be like we're going to beat you now. We'll use our own dynamic economies of scale to buy cheap parts and make a better and more dynamic machine that's going to make your machine look really bad or at least subpar or at least not as powerful. That's a mistake for Microsoft. I think Microsoft should hold on as long as possible before releasing this console and they need each other. I think that's the most important part is why I mean when you look at the Switch like the biggest point of feedback from the general consumer not from the Nintendo fan is where's the third party support and the third party support only exists in the way",

And so if the if we are now creating a three- tiered system, it's going to there's going to be a clear winner, a clear loser in terms of the HD twins or whatever. Um and then there's going to be third party exclusives where it's like, well, Call of Duty is better on Xbox and Battlefield's better on PlayStation, for example, whatever. And they're going to have to double down that way. And it's it's going to it's going to get nasty.

I think that Sony seems to be playing this the smartest right now. Even though I think PS4 Pro is an unnecessary stumble and and and again, you know, they would be talking about it more if it was selling that like like and I'm sure it's doing fine, but how long did it take them to announce that a million PS4s were sold in the United States on day one?

Again the dude the Ary dude saying that this is a new console again creates a whole series of frankly endemic problems to to this particular industry that could cause issues for them. And the only thing that he's saying which I think or the one thing that he says which is positive is that it's all based on the same architecture. So so porting between them should be at least easier than porting from Cell to Xbox 360 for instance on the PlayStation 3. But you are going to deal with these different I guess just a variable uh group of sliders basically that",

You're creating more work now PS4, PS4 Pro, Xbox One, Scorpio, PC. Now there are going to be five SKUs that these that these guys have to do. Well the thing is Switch as well. If if I'm not incorrect about this and I might be because this is the tech stuff I don't know at all but the architecture you're talking about the x86 or whatever. Isn't that also what the Switch is on? I don't I don't know anything about that. check it. But so possibly six SKUs. This is going to start to piss actually the publishers and the developers off. Um and so I think that they're probably going to get that feedback or I assume that they're getting that feedback. I'd be interested to see what feedback Sony's getting on Pro. What kind of patch",

Is Crystal Dynamics like that was a complete **** waste of our time. That was a complete waste of our resources. This is all important data for them to garner before they make any moves. So I'm with you. I don't think Scorpio's coming out this year. if it comes out this year then it is more akin to PS4 Pro. And and I think that's a huge mistake because they've already lost and you're dealing again with a group of people that is just much smaller and much less interested in buying a new console. Plus Microsoft is actually sending mixed signals with with Xbox publishing in the terms of like well all of our games are now on PC. Now all",

Very positive perhaps for Xbox as a publisher of games but they're not going to seed that ground to Sony. So like they're obviously going to keep making consoles. should the Xbox One's a very respectable piece of kit. So it's like I want to see how this all shakes out. But if I were if if I were them I would wait as long as humanly possible. And I would launch this console in the fall of 2018 which is when again I think the PS5 is going to launch. So um these guys have to make a move and and and to plate the developers and and the publishers. Switch does not use x86. What does he",

Something different. don't know where I was on but I mean the big thing is too I mean like it's it could go either way too because you figure if you're a third party how much work do you want to put into an an exclusive SKU for just Xbox Scorpio right? Like if PlayStation 4 is what's moving all the units you're going to do all that. And if this if Scorpio comes out and doesn't set the world on fire either and does respectably well you're not going to go out of your way to **** make a different SKU. Yeah you'll up-res the graphics and be done with it. We'll we'll see how it all shakes out.

PS4 came out a few weeks before it I think in 2013. So now we're going to have this whole **** up I don't know. I don't know how this plays. I don't know if it matters. Uh but I think it probably does. See I for me I I do think that Scorpio is the next Xbox system and I agree with you that I think the longer they hold off to that window of 2018 holidays I think is best for them. But I do think that there is a chance that that Scorpio uh I don't think this is going to happen.

I think that at least then they're not saying that it's a new system and they are allowing themselves to just give you more options cuz like I disagree with you about the PS4 Pro in the sense that I think it's awesome for people that want it and it's like doesn't need to light the world on fire because it's there for the people that care about 4K and care about all those things. And I think that with there is an Xbox One audience that is equivalent to that. And I think that at this point with Microsoft them losing and and all of that there's many decisions they can make.

And if they were to release a PS4 Pro version that is way the strongest thing we've seen thus far it's going to be a lot easier to do that this year than it will be to create a whole new system that's backwards compatible next year. Right. Well well two things. one. Yeah the Pros for someone and I'm I'm speaking more from a a bird's eye view in terms of there's something for everyone. The question is is this a w was this a wise course of action for the industry? Was this a wise course of action for Sony? And was this a wise investment for them?

Do they just go \"We're not releasing anything for a **** long time. We're letting this thing go and go and go until 2020 for instance.\" In which case this gives Microsoft an opening to do either of those things which is might be what Microsoft is is banking on which is to say like we could release an incremental console which is still going to be more powerful than PS4 Pro because Sony is selling so well that they don't need to do anything.

This is a dynamic situation. But I would endeavor to say that Microsoft has lost. We all know that. Doesn't mean that the console's bad. Doesn't mean that there's no value to be had there but that it is imperative on them to make the move first. Um and the move that they make first is going to really illustrate maybe perhaps the next decade in the gaming industry because Sony's going to have to be very reactionary to this. um Nintendo doesn't seem to care what anyone's doing but um it's an important step uh for these guys to take one way or the other.

The Xbox 360 was the Xbox the original Xbox was no joke as far as a console was it was ahead of its time in a lot of ways. I say that same thing about the Dreamcast in a lot of ways. These consoles were actually well ahead of their time. The fact that the original Xbox came with an Ethernet port was an incredible step. You know you had to buy an attachment for PlayStation 2 and GameCube to do that kind of stuff. And the the Xbox 360 itself was ahead of its time as well.
