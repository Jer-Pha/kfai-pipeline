Yeah, it's that, it's that nerdy little Japanese game you're playing. There's a, there's a cat with a hat on him and he's got these eyes coming through. You **** loser dork. When are you going to play Madden, you Berseria? Not in my country is what I say. Well, it's not, wasn't made in your country. That's true. It wasn't, definitely wasn't made in your country. Not in my country, Kevin Berseria. You got your Berseria, you Berseria? Yeah, how you doing? H, I'm all right. Little, little, little pooped. I don't know why. I, I had a, uh, a great night's sleep, very, very low weekend. Went to bed at a reasonable hour, woke up at what I feel like is a reasonable hour, but feel a strange fatigue, not entirely sure why that is, but I'm, I'm busting on through right now. You're doing it. You're just going to keep going and I feel a little cold. Yeah, it's chill in here. It's cold in here.",

Fitness is high because of the temperature that's been raised. Colin, what'd you play this weekend? Uh, what, beat Hue finally. Great game. We talked about that, uh, big fans Hue here quite a bit. Adding, we don't need to talk about that again. Uh, played a few more hours of Tales of Berseria, so I'm at like 15 hour mark. Berseria, Berseria, I'm sorry, Berseria, like Berseria.

That one, that trailer did all the damage it needed to do on a great Jim Sterling Let's Play of it.

I started looking at a whole bunch of these other games that are coming out. They're leaking up there and going up there and watch and like, there are a couple just, I mean, God awful trailers and I was like, we should do you and me Let's Play where we jump in and play a whole bunch of them. But then I was wondering, is that mean, is that me? Somebody tried a little bit on this game. You, I don't, I don't buy this, this ration.

I can't imagine objectively speaking, anyone would want to play that game. Nonetheless, uh, this idea that, well, the game exists, someone worked on it. And I'm like, yeah, that's great. Like, I appreciate that they tried. That doesn't mean that they're above ridicule. We get ridiculed all the **** time. We try, you know? And, uh, so no, I don't think it's mean spirited. In fact, it could be, you know, it could be useful to people that are going, you know, that want to save money, that we're looking for videos.

And I'm like, no, you're **** wrong. Actually, there are plenty. We worked at IGN forever. There were games where we had review as much as we could and there were plenty of games that got zero reviews on Metacritic. That's not uncommon. And it's not uncommon to have one or two reviews for a game you've never heard of from **** sites you never heard of. Yeah, so you don't know who to trust. Yeah, so I think that it's a, I think that it could be a useful thing. But, but Life of Black Tiger and some of these other games that are coming out, it's just like, you got to be **** kidding me.

You should invest in people that know games that object, can talk to the objectivity. These small sliver objectivity under every game is this game playable? Does this game work? Look at who looked at Life of Black Tiger in at Sony was like, yeah, this is fine. Like, what? No one like got up from their desk, went, talked to their boss, be like, I don't know if we really need this game that is going to sell literally 1,000 copies if that. And half the people that are buying it are buying it is a joke. There's typos in it. The graphics look seriously like early PS Graphics, maybe look like early iPhone Graphics.

Well, it's, it's always weird when we talk to the developers who go through these hoops and get rejected and they fail their, you know, QA or they get kicked back on this different thing. And it's like, to see and they're, they're failing 'cause they left like one field blank on their submission forum. I've talked to people about, right?

Yeah, very, very, very rigorous standards over there. So yeah, something to keep in mind when you're seeing these games. And so, should we do it? Maybe. Uh, is it mean-spirited? Perhaps. I was very mean spirited about Amy when I reviewed it, which is a game I always go back to. That game was **** terrible. I'll from the mountaintops. I don't care who it hurts. That game's **** sucks.

I thought it was a, a step back in the right direction for Resident Evil, which that's really needed. I think that they can build off of this. I'm seeing a lot of the reviews. I don't know necessarily agree that it's like a nine or a ten. Like, some people, I don't, I don't see it quite that way, but it's certainly great. And, uh, it starts a little slow.

Controls have been a turnoff to me. When they start trying to feel like action, it never worked for me. So to have it be, yeah, more adventure game feeling and then these, you know, interspersed boss fights or moments of action or jump scares, I thought that was a better balance for me of like, okay, cool. I'm really existing in this house. I'm really walking around trying to find all these things. I am managing my inventory, worrying about what I'm going to do, choosing different loadouts to go with pretty much.

The one, the one critique that I wish I remembered for the review that I didn't stand, that I didn't state, which is a big one for me and I don't know if you, uh, saw this, I don't know if anyone else cares, is that the game being in first person, yeah, requires it to tell you your hurt in different ways, unlike, uh, Isaac and Dead Space with the like his back, like on his back or the typical, uh, Resident Evil HUDs with like, you know, the, the, the health",

Like, you can't get rid of it.

Like, I just, I didn't find it a useful tool, especially because it's so, find, we're going to jump to the question here in a second. I played, you know, the first four and a half hours in VR. And when you pull up on the regular game, no VR, or even in the VR, right? You pull up your menu, one of your menus and you look at your watch and that has your health on it there, right?

And I'm like, I think that's my health, but it's weird that I can't ever, that's, that's **** weird, whatever. And then when I put in the game into and sat on the couch and played it that way, I was like, oh, like, no, that's just a weird VR HUD, you know, thing. I don't know if it was on, it wasn't on me, I don't think to look or move my head around a certain way to get to the watch. It just never, ever, any way I sliced it, was clear.

And then I'd go and a bug would attack me and I'd immediately get some and then I just had it on me forever. Exactly. That's what I'm saying, you know, all over me. But then in a game with item scarcity, although it's not, it doesn't practice item scarcity the way the, quite to the extent the old Resident Evil games do.

I was like, damn, like, I thought that that was somewhat of a sane issue in terms of, uh, of some sort of, I think, totally legitimate. And I think some sort of again, objective viewpoint of like, why do you want to have this clean HUD, but then glitter it with blood splatter for % of the game? It just doesn't look right. You should at least let people turn it off. Uh, Jeremiah J wrote in, said, hello, Greg and Colin. Resident Evil is finally out today.

And I found myself getting really excited to play the full experience, but I'm hesitant to jump in since the game is absolutely terrifying in VR. So I have to ask, with Resident Evil 7 being such a, a frightening experience, would it hinder itself from becoming a killer app for the PSVR? Or are we still waiting for the game/experience to skyrocket the PSVR? Thanks for all you doing the fun videos, Jeremiah J. Um, I don't think Resident Evil 7 is the killer app for VR. I think it is a great use of VR. I think it's a, I was comfortable the entire time playing for those four and a half hours.

Uh, and it's just natural state, I think, for us to play video games 'cause we've been raised that way. But it is awesome and it is, I think it's proof, which we haven't had, of a AAA long form 8 to 9 to 10 hour game can be done in VR and be enjoyable and you can play it that whole way. I saw Patrick Klepek tweeted today that he played the whole thing in PSVR. He says it's the way to play. I think it is way more immersive. It is scarier that way. Um, in terms of it being frightening and putting people off, kind of, I guess.

Then the nature of when we got the game and according, and in accordance with my personal schedule, meant that I wasn't even home, um, to play it. So, uh, I had to play it. I played on my girlfriend's PS4 naturally or normally. And, uh, it was, uh, it was perfectly fine that way. I thought it was fun that way as well.

I think it's a good proof concept and hopefully if it's well received, like it seems like it is so far with reviews, the VR component, it engages more developers. But we're going to talking about more VR here in a little bit. Uh, so yeah, I played Resident Evil 7. Beat it. Enjoyed it quite a bit. Uh, I beat Read Only Memories: 2064. That had been lingering around for a while. Liked it a lot, but I feel like it's, and I, I really enjoy the game. I recommend it for people to go do it. I especially, even if you're, you think you're ever going to play it. Yeah, I'll play when it comes to Vita probably. Okay, 'cause it's definitely right up your alley with the whole AI Turing and this whole thing.

The game doesn't give you a hold down the button to fast forward text thing because it's all text based, right?

But it's like a pain in the butt that if that was it, sure, if that was what was holding me back from getting the Platinum. But then the trophy list goes that extra way of, uh, you know, your ending trophies are be friends with character A, be in with character A, be friends with character.

Get killed while standing up, achieved 100 death. Goddamn Lucky Day, the Trophy called Lucky Day, bronze trophy. Survive to be hit by hand grenade, achieved 50 times.

It just doesn't seem like a sound business to it. It just doesn't seem like sound business to fund a game for 10 years that was never going to be anything more than a niche title.

Now, what why they let Team Ico do what they did, I have no shit idea.

I don't know why they the I I'm of the agreement that or of the mind rather that I don't expect that any Western studio will get away with that.

So I I think you have to be kind of careful about that. I think especially with the Sony we're seeing now, who's closing first parties and doing things differently. Uh I think that these are relics of the past in a lot of ways, right? I think if Gran Turismo was to start to come out on his schedule here and numbers are going down down down and they're not, then you'd see things get tighter. All right, we're going to pull you back. We're going to do this. As long as they're delivering, nobody cares.

And I think a lot of what a PlayStation fans, what how you would define a PlayStation fan would be, and I'm talking about the core person who would go to a PSX and will buy this and buy shirts and do all this crazy stuff for PlayStation, is someone who cares about that kind of game and cares about the Team Ico.

Do you guys think that Santa Monica Studio or maybe SIE in general is moving away from these kinds of project, or are they just rebooting their that part their part of the studio?
