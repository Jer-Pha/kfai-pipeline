So Kevin Coelho- This is how we're gonna do the show? Kevin Coelho's sick as a dog. Sick as a dog. He was sick yesterday he shouldn't have come in. Didn't listen and he finally said hey I woke up said I feel worse. Looked at the calendar big Nick Scarpino big daddy Nick big unky Nick as we call him going to the dentist. Text Tim Gettys hey explain everything I just said can you come in and co-host with Colin I'll drive. If not we can do it this way. No response from Tim Gettys I assume dead. Why is he dead? Why is he dead? I assume Gia killed him. Basic Instinct style. Did he have a long night last night? Ice pick I don't think so. Well I mean I assume now that Gia lives here they're just banging left and right. Too much of a good thing they say. Living here living together? Banging too much.",

But he never that would infer that there are many Slimers similar to what happened in the Ghostbusters reboot of 016 we all remember where there was a female Slimer which was really stupid and really dumb. Not the fact that she was female but the fact that there was a Slimer and then there was a female Slimer that was just Slimer again but it looked like Mr. and Mrs. Potato Hut. As far as I understand the only people that didn't like the 016 Ghostbusters were rampant sexist and alt-right cults. Hale Collin. Hale Collin I'm right here. I'm alt-right.

During its Fire Emblem focus Nintendo Direct today Nintendo announced a surprise new game in the series for 3DS. Fire Emblem Echoes Shadow of Valentina appears to be either a game heavily inspired by or a remake of Fire Emblem Gaiden on a grander scale.

The only information released so far is that it's due sometimes in 018. We'll update this story in an update from Nintendo PR. The company provided the following information about the untitled game. For the first time since Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn on the Wii console in 007 a new mainline game in the series is being developed for a Nintendo home system with the ability to also be played on the go. The new game is scheduled to launch in 018. Colin how are you feeling about that? I mean you need to start announcing things that matter and Fire Emblem is not going to move units.

Like I just I hope I'm wrong and I hope that the Switch succeeds and Nintendo thrives but I just don't see it. You know? I just don't see it. The best case scenario right now is that it pulls a 3DS move where it comes out flounders and then it has that remember that breakout in December where it was like what was it it was 011. Was it Mario there was a Mario and then a Smash right back to back? No it was Mario Kart. Mario Kart. Animal Crossing is that right? I want to say there might have even been a new Super Mario.

Because they released that the week before and the week of Vita's launch in Japan which they did intentionally. You know? So to really nullify the success of the Vita in Japan I think so. We need to see that wily Nintendo again and I mean this just reminds me a whole lot of it's not nearly as bad I don't think it's the Xbox One reveal but it's similar where people are like well Switch will be fine. I'm like I don't know Xbox One three and a half years later is still struggling to unleash those shackles from that particular release. A good reveal is everything. Think about PS3 right?

Interesting that they didn't, they got a capitalized legend over here, Chelsea. We really are at the end of the life for the Wii U.

It's like similar to Iraq and Afghanistan in that respect. I'm not saying World War II is massive. What I'm saying is that the conflicts meld together and a lot of the same people that fought in World War II and a lot of the same people that were in charge during World War II fought and were in charge during Korea. So there's a continuity there and it's kind of a natural epilogue to World War II.

Not that I think it's going to be bad, but I bet there will be plenty of reasons to knock it. 2017 is a jam packed year, man. A lot of good games coming out. A lot of good games coming out in the next few weeks. Yeah. It's a big part of the year. Resident Evil 7, Neo, Horizon, then Zelda, Mass Effect. A lot of good stuff coming out. The Idol Wilder says, is Tim still alive? That's a good question. No. No response from Tim. I don't know why he would be sleeping now. What indicates that to you? He's still at a sleep... Well, he hasn't responded to his text message. Oh, I see. He's still at a sleep deficit from that Nintendo event into Sean Finnegan shoot all weekend and then just a regular work week. Why do they agree to do things on weekends like that? They like helping their friends. Yeah, I know. I think it's one of those help their friends go to sleep.",

Big Bear Monty says, will you have a meet and greet at PAX East? No promises, so you have to come to the panel at 8.30 Friday night of PAX East. It might be an in and out trip like Roy was talking about. Oh really? So we get to just go in and leave? I mean, we're still figuring all that out. We could. It's still possible. That'd be great. Colin Was Right. The whole scheduling of that show now revolves around me being ready to go Monday morning, if not Sunday night when I actually wrote a lot of the stuff. Sure.

We just got out of the house. We would not be stoked to go back and do stuff there. Maybe down the line. Kinda Funny Comics Show is definitely on the list of things we want to do and hopefully we'll have news on that soon in some way. I just farted. I don't know if anyone heard it. CLA584, Halo Wars, Game of the Year. No, that's not it. No, not a prank. I'm sure it's going to be a great game though. Here's one, Colin. Jesus, it's all green and puke looking. Maybe Ravi DeWitt, I think. Can we get a Kinda Funny Rax, the presidential inauguration? No, you won't, but I'm wondering, Colin, will you wake up at 6 a.m. to watch it?

It might just be that with somebody's coverage starting at 6. I don't know. I was like, there's no way. When I googled for information, that's what Google gave me.

You get a download code for whatever and it's not every one of their books. It's just their monthly books. Where twice a month books are still going to be, and this is in the, this is in the rebirth lineup, are still going to be $.99. Do more people read comics digitally now or do they read them as a book? More, in terms of, I think the majority are still very much going to shops and buying.

Keep up on your League of Heels news. You can't have that without me. Spideyville says when and why did Colin get earrings? I got them in 2000 and it's because I listen to a lot of rap rock. You saw the people doing it. You're like, yeah, and I wanted to be like my rap rock heroes. 15 years later, still in. We're now in sub only mode.

Way too many games play right now. Way, way too many games. True. Can't go back. It's like another try. I played Witcher 3 for almost fifty hours. Like that's enough. Yeah. Yeah, that's enough already. You can only have so much Witcher 3, Greg. I agree before you can't, which are three anymore. Looking for the final question. Okay, here we go. Jedi be three eleven guys.

So, it's gonna be a fun little, I haven't been paying close attention to it either, but because I intentionally, I don't want to know really. Sure. It's fun that that hasn't been shoved down your throat. Like, it stands in stark contrast to Horizon, which I've actively avoided because now they're just showing you way too much.
