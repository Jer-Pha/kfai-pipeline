The watchmaker's goal is to change the way consumers think about fashion by offering high quality minimalist products at revolutionary prices. With over 500,000 watches sold in more than 160 countries around the world, Movement Watches has solidified itself as the world's fastest growing watch company. Movement Watches started just $95 and at a department store you're looking at 400 to 500 bucks. Buddy Movement figured out that by selling online they were able to cut out the middle and retailer markup providing the best possible price, classic design, stylized minimalism. I said minimalism, you understand what I mean? There's all these watches, we have a bunch here, we use them when we wear suits, we being me. I don't know what the other guys do.
