Well I haven't gotten to that part yet but anyway so we know that eventually we're going to get fucked. Sure. So I was already not excited about this. I'm looking at my thing. This is Alaska and I'm super bummed about it. I'm like God damn it. Need to freaking go cross country on Alaska. First world problems. This is what I complained about.

Like Nick just fucking loves just being at airports. Really? Yeah. I love it. Why? Cause I don't know. Okay. Here's the deal. I'll take that. It stems from the fact that at IGN we used to go on so many trips that required gear that it was always a pain in the ass to get the gear either through security or if it was an international trip you'd have to go get what's called a carne form which was you'd have to find whatever fucking small hole in the wall. This form was generated on our side. And then you'd have to find you'd have to submit that form on the other little hole in the wall on the other side of the world.

And most of the time they didn't know what the fuck it was or they didn't have the stamp for it or whatever. And the gear would get held up in customs. And so it was always a pain in the ass. And so I learned after the first like fucking 10 times of almost missing flights because these people are like is this a camera? I don't know what it does. You know it's a Starbucks cup. But you know they stamp it. So after a while I'm like look I'm just going to get to the airport like at least two hours early. And then I would get through the security. And then granted if you get through the security line you know in 10 minutes you got an hour and a half. You sit there you just answer emails read get a cup of coffee fight for the outlets.

So when you go there and he can get his Starbucks and get his protein meal with the little fucking hard boiled egg and little he's just happy as a pig and shit. Cause it just $30 on eggs that sort of thing. Every airport you go to is the same airport. So he's stoked. Yeah. It's just it's a matter of just like de-stressing. Right. I love flights. I like being on planes. It's weird to say but it's like it's the one thing that like I like really long international flights because it takes me out of my routine.

And so magazines if you're in a humid environment well the the the cover of them will like it'll start to bubble up. You can get the thing. And one of my my one of my favorite issues of the magazine was when they did the American cinematographer for those of you who don't know is a very hardcore film journal specifically centered around cinematography.

Now you're sounding a lot like me. Fair enough. Yeah. We should probably not hang out. Let's not hang out. All right. My topic is about Nick Scarpino. Nick, a while back on a few shows ago, you teased, you should do your waiter slash food stories as a topic. Right. I want to hear some, I want to hear about some of these stories.

I was going to say for the record, you can of course go to my Instagram, instagram.com slash game over. And I still use your pizza method. That pizza I made last week was so fucking phenomenal. I bought the stuff again to make it this week. So I, yeah, my, my friend of mine worked at a place called Bumpas, which was near, near, was it near Patsy's? It was very close. It was near a, an Edward cinema in Riverside, California. It's not just no longer there unfortunately, but he got me a job as a waiter. Now we made, I'm sorry, a cook rather.

So that's, that's where I learned the, the sort of the value of, of working hard and not working smart. Right. And so that, that was, I always say like when you're young and you're just starting out in anything, what you end up doing, the cycle that you end up being in is learning what not to do over and over and over and over again until eventually you figure out, figure it out. And then you're like, oh, I'm, I'm an idiot all this time. I'm working way too hard. I should work smarter. This was the job that I was like, this is the worst job I'm ever going to have.

And then when all the waiters got to go home, we would have to do, we have to clean up the kitchen. Like a normal restaurant, you have a cleaning crew that comes in. So like a really fancy restaurant, like the cooks don't clean, they'll clean their station probably and make sure everything's prepped for the next day and sanitized or whatever. But then there's a deep clean that happens every night. We did the deep clean.

And so at the end of every night, I would literally get on my hands and knees and scrape like fucking pasta or dough that had been like ground into this floor over the spirit period of like six hours, scrape it all, sweep it up, take a fucking dirty, like a clean mop. And by the way, when you were done with the mop water, it would start off clean. It would be fucking brown. And then I would have to do that for like every other part of the kitchen.

I, he was a Sigma Nu, he was drinking like every fucking night. He looked great because he was like, you know, it looked like he was training for like the sex Olympics.

So I'd get the Sunday afternoon shifts where we would, everyone would bring breakfast and we would just have cereal and then someone would walk in and be like, you kind of go over and serve them and come back to like just chilling. It would be a nuisance. Make people feel unwelcome the second they walk in, like, should we be here? Are you guys open? It was like an Italian restaurant for lunch.

There was like, it'd be like girls like this, the hostesses would drop like flies because every like six months one of them were like, I'm pregnant. And then it was always super awkward because like you knew the guy that was begging them was also begging the other hostesses.
