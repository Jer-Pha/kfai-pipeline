You've all been joke mind fucked, and it was all consensual. So they've been in on the joke for a while now, because you missed one of the episodes with me and Nick on here for the back when it was called Colin and Greg Live. Yeah, I remember that show. And we- May it rest in peace. It was the launch trailer for Final Fantasy XV. And I was like, oh, we're going to watch this, Nick. And we did. And it was called the Ride Out trailer, which is the name of the song. Right it is, yeah. And I was like, oh shit. Nope. Didn't use the song. It was the",

And I also loved that they couldn't get the licensing to fucking ride out, but they can get Eminem. Don't make sense. They probably thought that was a bigger name.

It's a little alarming that we're this close to launch and one of the most focused peripherals is just totally not available. A very eagle-eyed Reddit user. Aha! That's eagle. Looks like the pro controller just cleared FCC yesterday.
