  "description": "Welcome to Kinda Funny Year 3! Community is our focus in 2017, and we've heard that you want the Kinda Funny Morning Show (formerly Colin & Greg Live) on YouTube and as a podcast. So, that's what we're doing. \n\nThe Kinda Funny Morning Show will still be live on http://www.Twitch.com/kindafunnygames Monday through Friday, but from now on, the KFMS will also post here on YouTube, and eventually, it'll pop as a daily podcast. We're still troubleshooting the podcast process and expect to have it working in the coming weeks/months.\n\nCommunication is important to us, so understand that this is a whole new world for us. We're figuring it out as we go. There's a good chance that episodes of the KFMS will be muted, taken down, and so on. We're experimenting with this on the fly and learning as we go. \n\nSo, let's try something new together!\n\nSubscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSupport us and get the shows early here! http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny\n\nCheck out our store! http://www.kindafunny.com/store\n\nFollow us on Twitter!\nGreg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy\nColin - http://www.twitter.com/NoTaxation\nTim - http://www.twitter.com/TimGettys\nNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_Scarpino\nKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids\n\nEvery day Greg Miller, Colin Moriarty, Tim Gettys, and Nick Scarpino talk about the biggest stories in nerd culture.",

I did to New York City with Kevin Quello, big dog Kevin Quell. How was that? It was fantastic. I mean, it had its ups and downs, the downs being the conference that I watched. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This the first time we've gotten to actually talk about the Switch event. I still haven't heard your in-depth Impressions on it. Yeah, I still don't know what you thought of the games you played. Yep. So okay, here's here's the deal, Greg, the on Gamescast that we're going to be recording that goes live next week, I'm going to there'll be a topic where I really go into detail, break down all the games I played and all that stuff and whatever.

Um, I was thrilled to hold it in my hands after that conference and to be like, okay, this is good, not all hope is lost. Okay, um, now again, it did tarnish my experience enough the conference, yeah, where I was like playing this stuff and I was like kind of looking around at the games that were were in the the events and just being like, can't play Mario, that's kind of sad, you know, like I I went in expecting to play Mario and again, kind of that's my own fault. Sure. Got yourself psyched up. I did, but I also feel like I wasn't asking for much, uh, in in what I was expecting and I think that the conference was enough of a let down to people like me that it it's a problem because it was their game to to just run away with.

No, like this is just Nintendo being Nintendo and that's the sad part to me is that just means that I'm going to need to deal with another decade of people talking **** about the thing that I like. Yeah, you know, and that that's the most upsetting part cuz the devic is fantastic. It's what the Wii U should have been. Um, the games, every single game I played was fun, every single one. Uh, I played um this game called Puyo Puyo Tetris cross Tetris, yeah, and you are going to love it. It is a Greg Miller game when it comes to PlayStation through and through.
