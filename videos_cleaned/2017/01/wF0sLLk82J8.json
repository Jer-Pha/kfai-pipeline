      "text": "I on topic of the day as always brought to you by you. You can go to KindaFunny.com/GamescastTopic to leave your topic, just like Brian Artist Jackson did. Brian Artist Jackson, how would you like gaming to improve in 2017? Ponder that. Well, I think what I think what EA just did today, as we're recording this, with with a release date from Mass Effect being announced, what, early two and a half months or so before the game comes out, I think is a great example what we've been talking about, about keeping your cards closer to your vest until you're ready to say something, about giving people something really, really excited about in a finite amount of time with something that's imminent. I think it's a really cool, cool thing. We've seen that, you know, and sporadically. We've also seen the opposite with what Rockstar did with Red Dead Redemption 2. So that's one way I'd like to see gaming improve is to publishers take your time, developers take your time, and when there's something to say, say",

So that's one way I'd like to see gaming improve is to publishers take your time, developers take your time, and when there's something to say, say it, say it definitively, and say close to when you're ready to actually show something. I don't like these long lead times, and I hope we continue to learn from that. Give up on the always online stuff. Give up on us always online crap, like you even Watch Dogs, see where I got to connect to the server and log in, all that stuff at the beginning. And then you're gonna, PVP is in there, right? You're forcing me to play with the people and all that stuff. Like, let's focus on single player. Let's just let me have the experience I want and keep going that way. Mm-hmm. For me, I just, I hope there's less delays. Okay. I think that 2016 might have been the end of that era of all of these games getting delayed constantly, constantly, constantly. There will always be delays for the rest of time, sure, but I hope and I",

Yeah, and it's like going back to what Colin's saying, I think that like those are things that go hand in hand. And I think then 2017, hopefully a lot of game, like I, I was wrong thinking that Horizon was going to get delayed by the end of 2016, so I hope that that stays true. Yeah, I hope the Switch is awesome. George Barrett says, do you guys have any gaming New Year's resolutions? I want to play more games. I feel like that's such an easy thing to say, sure, probably not going to be able to stick to it as much as I'd like to, but I have fun playing games.

And the few times I've been able to play things recently, I'm like, crap, man, I love Final Fantasy 15. Like, why don't I do this more? I think the one, if for GameOverGreggy, I did the topic of where I went through all the movies I watched. I want to keep a better track of everything I play this year, because I feel like, you know, we were doing, when we're doing a Game of the Year stuff and rounding up, like I look at my trophies, which is pretty great, but then I almost forgot that it got mentioned, but I forgot that I played Gone Home or whatever. Not that I was gonna put that on my list, but I had fun with it, and it's a game that I'm like, all right, I played that, and like that",

I was, I got crap, I don't remember playing that this year. But we play so much in a year that it, by the end, you get to, you like, what did I play that wasn't on here? I know I've played some games. What if I played over? They don't know what. Also, a year used to mean something different in games because of how things were released, where it's like you only needed to pay attention to August to December. Yeah, and it was like, what happened the last couple months? You can remember that. But like, Superhot that was released, like, yeah, like there's so many of these games that I'm like, man, I would have sworn that was way longer ago. But that's just how time works. I mean, last year, 2016, I played an absurd amount of games. I couldn't believe how many games I",

I think that this 2016 was a very good year for games. I think some people are pretty critical about it. I thought it was a really great year. And so I want to continue to to pay heed to the games that speak to me and spend, continue to find time to spend with those games, 'cause I really do think I did a nice job with that in 2016, unbalancing all that kinda stuff, because games are certainly a balancing act. And when I am playing them, especially as an adult, and when I went back and looked at my trophies for our Game of the Year list, I was shocked by how much I played.

So it's a scheduling issue, but there's a lot of great games coming out this year, or games that I'm excited about. We're going to get Resident Evil 7, and I'm gonna get Tales of Berseria, which I'm super excited about. We're going to move right into Horizon, and we're going to right into Mass Effect Andromeda. There's a lot of stuff in the first quarter. How about Resident Evil, man? I always forget it's super close date. Is it the 24th? Holy crap, twenty days. Really, really excited about that. We might get at any moment, I should reach out. Oh man, reach out and touch it. Uh, Justin Pruitt says 'Pratt' and his Twitter name is LPFanaticForever. I love that.

I hope more than anything it will be remembered as the year the Nintendo comes back. That's a great point. I hope that it is just Nintendo. Crap, takes it by the horns, breaks that motherfucker's neck, and it's just like, I'm crap back and ready. Just comes out and he's just like, it's like a Donkey Kong, Saiyan, Goddamn Reggie. My body's goddamn ready. Never was the horns. Did you break the year's neck when what? Oh my god, that's visceral. Overrun, man. I wouldn't expect that from Reggie. Seems like such a nice guy.

Um, you know, as I said, as I said, as I said, and Colin was right, not that I'm spoiling looks that you guys probably already seen anything, watch it, but about the Switch is that expectations are what's really important. Switch-pectations, they call them in the video. And I feel like I feel like the expectation, it, we just need to narrow the expectation down. If we, if if Switch sells twice as much as Wii U, three times as much as Wii U, that's a massive success. And I'm not saying in the year, I'm saying lifetime. Like, Switch is still going to be a niche device. Switch is not going to outsell PS4, you know? Like, so just keep your your expectations in check. Focus on the positive in terms of the games and the quality. So what it's 70 or whatever. Apparently, I'm going to be on the hand. Other games go to the games. Fun that you can nail the base. If they can nail the price, if they can nail the messaging, if they can get all the bad news out of the way, the battery",

If they can nail the price, if they can nail the messaging, if they can get all the bad news out of the way, the battery life's good, etcetera, and so on, then I think Nintendo can have a very successful time with this thing. But again, context is everything. Even 3DS, which seems like a runaway success, has sold a small fraction of what of what the DS sold, because things are changing. And I also think that what are the interesting underlying things that we're going to find out with the Switch is if the Switch does well, I think Sony in particular is paying attention to this, and I do not think we have seen the last of a Sony handheld if Switch does well. And I stand by that. Like, Sony is not going to let Nintendo have this untested market share if this thing is big. And they're always doing R&D. They're always, I'm sure, testing and thinking and trying new things. And so I think that that's gonna be an underlying story that might be",

I really, I think a healthy Nintendo is going to be good, and an independent Nintendo is gonna be good for the game industry. Sony, so you can, they should watch what Reggie does to 2017, which is this whole thing. They should be careful. That's all. You know what you want. Okay, don't have the horns come near. Say, Sony, horns come in there at Vita. It's about to get crap. Got. I see. I don't think it's going to get get as much as this is the evolution. This is Nintendo. They saw the Nintendo saw the Vita, and they said, you're close, Sony. We could protect this.

And that's where the Vita lacked. And putting the Nintendo games on there, when it is Nintendo just focusing on one library instead of the Wii U and 3DS, like, man, it's a very exciting time to be a Nintendo fan, which is awesome to say, because it's been like 10 years. But this time, like, your why, I see even that you guys always get excited for your Directs, even back in the day, you get excited to E3 press conferences, and we were always sit on the sidelines like, don't do it.

I only halfway agree with that, because there was a lot of times it's like when I, you are expecting they're gonna do this crazy thing absolutely perfectly, then you're gonna get disappointed. But I do think that Nintendo did a really good job of when it came to games like Smash. Their smash things are amazing. Their Directs, when it was like press conference Directs, where them had a whole bunch of stuff, that's when you're gonna get disappointed. But when it was like, we're doing a Direct just about Mario Kart, we're doing a Direct just about Super Mario 3D World, or just about Bayonetta, or just about Smash Bros., that's what it's like, you're gonna get excited.

And I think they also did a really good job hyping those games and keeping me excited for those games. I wasn't excited for their business plan, but now for the first time, I am. And it's like, they have not crapped up. And you keep saying about the the bad news coming, and like, we're getting closer and closer to there not being bad news. And like, everyone, of course, is going to find something to be upset about, but personally, I think we're in the clear. Okay, let's get it. Weezy J. Wells says, obviously the most important gaming news of the day, Pok\u00e9mon Snap finally on the Wii U Virtual Console. Pok\u00e9mon Snap is this. I'm going to get a lot of crap for this.
