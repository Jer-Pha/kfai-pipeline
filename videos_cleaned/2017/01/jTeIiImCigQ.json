Uh, basically I try to make music that would be on par with, you know, stuff like Radiohead or M83 or Michelle Branch. Yeah, Michelle Branch. Um, um, anything off the Garden State soundtrack.

'Cause I feel like the genre itself is sort of stagnant in a lot of ways. So I'm constantly pushing it in every possible way I can. So if you're a fan of of dudes like, you know, Eminem or or, you know, Tech N9ne or yeah, Tech N9ne, Strange Music, yeah, or or Common, um, uh, that would probably be like if those dudes wrapped over M83 and like synth-wave at this point, that's kind of what I'm doing, you know what I'm saying?

We're like looking at our flights and I'm kind of bummed because our flight's on Alaska Airlines. And we're like, \"Man, fuck Alaska.

Like Nick just, fuck. Nick loves just being at airports. God, really? Yeah, I love it. Why? 'Cause I don't know. Okay, here's the deal. I'll take that. It stems from the fact that at IGN, we used to go on so many trips that required gear that it was always a pain in the ass to get the gear either through security or if it was an international trip, you'd have to go get called the carnet form, which was you'd have to find whatever fucking small hole in the wall this form was generated on our side.

And most of the time they didn't know what the fuck it was or they didn't have the stamp for or whatever. And your gear would get held up in customs. And so it was always a pain in the ass. And so I learned after the first like, fuck, 10 times of almost missing flights because these people are like, \"Is this a camera? I don't know what it does.\" No, it's a Starbucks cup. Yeah, ex, well, I'm, but you know, so after a while, I'm like, \"Look, I'm just going to get to the airport like at least hours early.\" And then I would get through the security. And then granted, if you get through security line, F, like, you know, in 10 minutes, you got an hour and a half. You sit there, you just answer emails, read, get a cup of coffee, relax. Outlets.

So when you go there and he can get his Starbucks and get his, his uh, protein meal with the little fucking hardboiled egg and little, fuck, he's just happy as a pig in shit. 'Cause just $30 on eggs. That sort of thing. Every airport you go to is the same airport. So he's stoked. Yeah, it's just, it's a matter of just like de-stressing, right? I love flights. I like being on planes. It's weird to say, but it's like, it's the one thing that like, I, I like really long international flights because it takes me out of my routine. It takes me out of my like, my, my brain.

And so magazines, if, if you're in a humid environment, will, the, the, the cover of them will like, it'll start to bubble up. You don't get that thing. And one of my, my, one of my favorite issues of the magazine was when they did the American Cinematographer. For those of you who don't know, is a very hardcore film journal specifically centered around cinematography. It's not about directing, it's not about writing. It's literally about the art of how they light and film movies. Um, and one of the movies that I loved from a couple years ago was Straight Outta Compton.

Pet peeve two is I cannot fuck stand when you put the thing in, forget it's in there, you put another thing in, and then you take the magazine out and the cover is bent and you're never get that crease out of there. Just a weird sync mind. So I figured, I'm like, \"Ziploc bags, perfect size. The gallon Ziploc bags, you can fit three in there. You tighten them up. They're watertight. Boom. They're keeping them nice and crisp like, like new sheets.\" You know what I mean? So that's fucking incredible, bro. I do the same with books too.

Like my, the last Harry Potter book that came out, this, the, the play, I put that bad boy right in the Ziploc bag. It's perfect. Jesus, man. I feel like Ziploc's missing out in a whole market of like book lovers. I'm just destroying the environment. Left. So in the New York trip, we're in the Ubers to the airport. Ubers to the airport. So our flight is it at 7:05 is when it takes off. And at, I'm being dropped off at this airport and it is 5:50. And I'm like, \"I'm good, right? That's way more than enough time.\" 7:05, you're being dropped off at 5:50. What terminal you going out? So that was my thing. I'm used to flying Virgin. I'm used to understanding how the fuck goes. Anytime I've had to fly United, there's always the issues and like, shit gets bad, right? Virgin, you just walk up to the kiosk thing. They give you your shit. You're, you're checked in, right? They treat you like gods. Uh, but we're going to Alaska as we're",

I don't, I don't know which one it is.\" He's like, \"Oh, I think it's an international.\" Immediately when he said that, I'm like, \"Oh no. I didn't plan enough time for this. This is going to turn into an endeavor.\" Uh, I look it up. I'm like, \"Okay, yeah, no. Alaska is in the international terminal, even though I'm going somewhere domestic.\" Whatever. I'll let this shit slide. I fucking hate Alaska. We get there, walk in. I'm like, \"All right, looking around. Find the Alaska area.\" I walk up to and I start using the little terminal thing. Does not read my card. Doesn't read another card. Doesn't read my ID. I'm just like, \"Oh, this is such a fucking pain in the ass.\" I call Kev to make sure he was up and on his way.
