The watchmaker's goal is to change the way consumers think about fashion by offering high quality minimalist products at revolutionary prices. With over 500,000 watches sold to customers in 160 plus countries around the world, Movement Watches has solidified itself as the world's fastest growing watch company. Greg Miller has his sexy one with the red hands, the black face. Oh baby, it looks nice. Mov Watches started just $95 at an apartment store. You're looking at 400 to 500 bucks. Movement figured out that by selling online they're able to cut out the middleman and retail markup providing the best possible price. We're talking about classic design, quality construction, and styled minimalism. You know I'm a fan of that.

You want to know what Andrew Taylor had to say Greg? Yeah, I do. What are some of the smaller indie games that we know of that you're excited for any VA exclusives? Greg, how does Patapon make you feel? Patapon makes me feel amazing. I can't wait to get Patapon. Can't wait for there to be released. It can't wait to platinum it. Can't wait to play it non-stop for the rest of my life. Smaller games you're looking forward to? I mean the big one, the smaller one that I think you'll agree with is Emily is Away. That's on my list. Damn it, you stole it from me. I thought em way too early 2017. Come on, you **** kidding me. Another I am Adventure get on the instant messenger.",

It's a simulation. It's a step back in time where you're using AOL Instant Messenger to talk to this girl Emily and so she says stuff and then you have to pick your response and it you it's one, two, or three, but you have to still type it out what it would be or whatever. Like you start typing and then it just makes it makes it feel like you're really doing it and me and Tim started the let's play totally joking. It was like a 45-minute game too. You want to replay it for different endings, different you know how does she respond to this or that or the other thing and but it's just sitting there talking you pick your buddy icon but to hear the buddy list and",

I mean by the end of it we were so so invested. Watch that my favorite thing about it is that in addition to having the Buddy icons and having your profile and being able to look at your buddy list and read other people's profiles and get kind of the story of the world uh it takes place over a couple years and those years being from like 2001 to 2006 uh when you and your character goes from like high school and then into college it's like your first your finally your senior year or whatever and then it's your freshman year of college and so un forth it's awesome and your so your buddy",
