Um, so I want to talk about Cuffing Season. You know, I know what that is. You guys, uh, don't know what Cuffing Season is, and the reason why you guys don't know what Cuffing Season is because you all have ladies. All have ladies. I really don't know if that's the reason.

Um, the second it gets cold, suddenly all those texts start to get returned on the, \"Hey stranger, how have you been?\" And the next thing you know, your phone is blowing up with a bunch of randos hitting up your phone like, \"Um, so what's going on this weekend?\" Uh, \"So are you ever coming coming into town?\" And as a performer, right, I've I've dabbled. I've dabbled around. You have women in every port. I've dabbled around, uh, and, uh, you know, that starts to blow up your phone after a while. So, um, I don't know.

In the summer you want to be freewheeling, wearing scantily clad outfits, going out with Dukes, so many Daisy Dukes tops. And it's understandable. Like, I I understand the the, you know, the the need to sort of like be free during the the summer months. But Jesus Christ, man, it is the desperation in these texts. Is it because when it gets cold, they want to like cozy up? I imagine the warmth factor. It's the warmth, apparently. Uh, well, here's a very scientific chart. Kevin, go ahead. Ahad found this chart for us. Let's bring this. I didn't I didn't believe it.

You see, I mean, you see like spring fever is when people really start. It's when you're outside of the holidays. February. Oh, look, I didn't even think about that either. Oh, Kevin can have more coffee too. February is another peak. It looks like if you're listening to the audio version, the big peak February for Valentine's Day.

I just don't think it would be possible because there's just too many greener pastures. There's always something out there that you could potentially get. And it's just, you know, it's crazy.

They'd go throw up and then they just **** and then they just completely do that over and get until they passed out. That's a great lifestyle. Let's be a great lifestyle. It sounds fun for a while.

Because you know, we all have those friends that are like, \"Ah, let's go to the **** bar.\" Like nothing good ever happens after 3:00 a.m. Like ever. Like trust me, I know.

Right. You're like, \"Wait a minute, we're we were like really tight.\" Exactly. And then it turns out maybe we're not so tight.
