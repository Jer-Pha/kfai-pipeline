No, that's really great. Uh, my topic is minimalism. I watched the a documentary about minimalism called Minimalism, uh, on Netflix. Not a the documentary was good. It was fine. It was about it was following the two guys that wrote a book about it and they're touring around to promote that book and just telling people sort of their uh, their theories and mentality when it comes to just our consumer culture in general.

It's not necessarily that it's more it's more about not owning for the sake of owning, not consuming for the sake of consuming, not getting caught up in needing the new every year, needing the new car every two years. Like it it kind of redefines the the the the uh, the definition of materialism, right? And this is one of the things these guys really kind of focus on. They were like, materialism used to be about really caring about the things that you had and the materials they were made out of and like, you know, when you bought a car, you cared about that car and you took care of that car for a long time. You took pride in the fact that you could work on that car and like would wash the car. Now we've gotten to a point as a society where we don't value those things anymore.

But in reality, you know, when they and they they cite some studies where they're like, the more things that people need, the like this is what they need, this is where their happiness levels goes because there's never enough. Yeah, right? Like and they talk about Black Friday, they talk about, um, these these big events where people just have to have the stuff, but they don't really know why they need it. It's a it's this weird impulsive need. And when they get it, it doesn't fulfill that that part of them that's that's sad or lonely or or unhappy. Um, and so I don't necessarily 100% agree that you can't like find a happy middle ground. Um, but I see it in myself, right? Case in point, like I have a cell phone that I've had for",

But like Tim, for instance, you love the tech, you love it, right? Um, but so I just wanted to get your guys just talk about that with you guys because I feel like especially in this day and age where everything's so easy attainable. Well, I think that's that's kind of what it is. It's this it's the addiction to scrolling, like especially with phones where it's just like you wake up in the morning and the first thing you want to do is like, how many notifications do I have? And it's like you just even if you don't care, you just you got to get to the bottom. You know, you go on Instagram, you want to see you want to see everything.

It's not like, oh man, I hope I see this picture. I found myself being annoyed. I don't know if it's a recent update or not, but and maybe it's always been this way. I don't think it is. But with Instagram where all right, cool, I'm scrolling. Oh, somebody text me. I pop over to see the text. I come back to Instagram and it bops to the top, go right back to the top of the feed. It doesn't let me pick up from where I left off scrolling. And I'm like, what the fuck? And I'm like, wait, why do I care so much? I had like a fuck breakdown in New York with Kevin where I'm like, this fuck Instagram update keeps bumping me to the top and it's so annoying. I'm like, there's a problem here that I am this upset.

We're talking about the games I've been playing and I've been jumping around so much, right? And I'm and granted nothing was striking me. We're playing a game soon here that I think is going to hook me in. But I was thinking about it this weekend while I was just chilling because of course when Jen's in town, fuck my phone. I'm not, you know what I mean? She's the one I'm usually texting. So when I'm done, usually I'll text her. She's responding. She's going to do something.

Cause it's getting to the point where I feel like, man, if I cobbled together all the time, I would have played probably more Gravity Rush and I would have played more Yakuza and I would have played more of ROM. You know what I mean? Like I need to figure that out. I feel like there's got to be a balance. Yeah, it's for me. I mean, we've talked about similar things many times in the show. I yeah, I I love this stuff. So it's like I don't necessarily I think that there is a line where it becomes a problem, but I think that people like to to kind of create these scenarios where they feel like they're better than other people where it's just like, well, you're just addicted to",

The thing about it for me is I'm not throwing stones and saying like this, right? For me, it's just that I feel like my quality time has gone down. I feel like I used to be all over and make making better posts and doing better things. But now I'm checking even if I'm not posting or responding to com. Yeah, it's I had to move all of my social apps into a folder like on a third page of my phone because I was it was just every fuck every time I I had to check Twitter, check Snapchat, check, you know what I mean? It like OCD kicks in so hard if you have those tendencies, um, that I I had to hide it cause if I see it, I'll I'll have to check it. So doing that, I I don't check my socials as much.

Yeah, you know, um, I I feel that a lot cause I try to do too much as Tim knows. Um, I try to do way too much and it's like it's a super fuck distracting thing. It's just it's just distracting. Like if you can manage that distraction, you'll get a lot more done and just be more present in your day. You know what I'm saying? Oh, I agree. Yeah. So that's that's my but I mean minimalism back to that or whatever it is. The thing of like, you know, I think first some I I you know, it's funny living with Colin of course, because Colin has like nothing except like his few shelves of toys and I have more stuff and more statues and more comics.

It's like I feel I'm running very low in terms of what I'm going. And I was talk about like the Funko Pops. Like I'll only buy a Superman Funko Pop or backro if I really like it. But like I'm not I you if that Funko Pops would have come out when I was in high school, I'd have every fuck one of those things and have them in all these different rooms and all these different things.

This is the same thing everyone was talking about. I feel like it's the new vegan. It's the new thing where it's like, I'm a minimalist. And people like kind of take pride in that fuck. Cause multiple people I know are like committing to that and they're like defining themselves as minimalists. And I'm like, and like I'm not trying to talk shit about it. Like cool, that's definitely movement. There's definitely a movement happening with in in our culture today, which is a direct correlation or a backlash from the from from the pace and the and the the level of consumerism that we've all become, right?

And I think those kind of go hand in hand, which is like, how do you just take a moment to just focus on the present right now and not worry about all the fuck you should have had or done or what you're going to do, right? And I think that minimalism kind of ties into that where you see like like I would probably count myself amongst the minimalists, not in the not I'm not going to go out and like live in a fuck house that's the size of a small comp car or anything like that. But you've been to my house. We have a whole room that has a fuck yoga mat in it. I mean, Nick's house is it's it's the most minimalist thing you can possibly have.

And that was that was one of the things that I learned when I moved in with her was I had all these DVDs and books and all this stuff that I thought that like, I don't know why I had it. I don't know why I was collecting it. I don't know what what I why that was happening in my life. It's just something that I'd always done. And it wasn't until she said, you know, you don't have to to have this stuff. Like you can keep just the books that you really love that you that that are these cherished moments. But you don't need your textbooks from college anymore. You don't need the DVD collector set of this movies, these movies that you're never going to watch again, especially",

Like and so when I moved in with her, I was like, I don't why do I have this weird anxiety about throwing this fuck out or giving it to Goodwill? And she's like, well, you got to ask yourself that. Like, where does that come from? What is that about? And when I did it, when I finally was like, I don't need this stuff. Like I don't need to clutter my life with things just for the sake of having or owning. I was I literally had my happiness level went up because I was like, I don't have to worry about that. It's one less thing I have to worry about that doesn't fuck matter. It doesn't matter that I have a 14 books on my shelves that no one ever sees cause I don't have people over my house anyway.

Like I touched I don't that fuck think about, you know, doesn't matter. Um, so so yeah, I mean, I think there is something to it though. There definitely is. And I mean, I think that we're in an interesting point now with the digital versus physical conundrum that keeps coming up, whether it's movies or music or video games where, you know, a lot of people that have collected games for years are at a point where or collected whatever media it is, um, hit a point where it's like the developers aren't even making everything available physically. Like I mean, even with music, there's so many EPs that there is never a CD that comes out because like to the artist, why would they do that? Because they're",

But it's like that's hard to wrap your head around because when you enjoy collecting the things you want that stuff and you feel like you're missing out on it. And there is there is like something in your mind where just you like it, you know, it's like that the collecting is what makes you happy. So and so I think I forget. I don't think it was in this documentary. I think I just heard it someplace. But there were but there was someone talking about it might have been on a podcast I listen to. You're talking about vinyl and how vinyl's like making a weird resurgence now.

It's it's it's it's society going, wait, like maybe we maybe we want that thing that was like tangible and physical and like we could hold. It's that niche, right? Of like it is collecting things. It is holding things. And it's like, yeah, I don't want, you know, for me, my collecting traits, right? Like Comics, I stayed away from comics and famously because everyone know this fuck.

I was already what, 19, 17 trade paperbacks in before I started using ComiXology. So I was like, well, I got to keep this going. I got to keep this going. Kevin with his Simpsons DVD collection. Like, why are you still buying the DVD versions of Simpsons? But you fuck love it. Got dude. Tim Tim stopped. Season 17 is the last one. They stopped making DVDs the Simpson seasons. That sucks. See, that's what I'm talking about. Like you you spend all the time collecting. Like my my most prized possession, my Fast and Furious steelbook Blu-ray collection.

But I look over, I was looking over yesterday on the shelf cause it's piled up with all these PS3 games I never play anymore. And it was like, it's all sun faded now. I looked over it like them cause the sun's been hitting. It's just like, I when am I going to watch the Dogma DVD again? Not that I don't love Dogma, but like is it's probably on demand.

Like I was there. I made sure that I pre-ordered day one. Like I made sure that I was on the up and up, not just of getting it, but like knowing it was happening, right? And it's not not just the music, like with games and stuff, being able to to see the collections I have where I'm like, yeah, these are the collector editions. They're not the greatest hits version. There's no fuck ugly green stripe on it. Like I got I was there. It feels important for timeline.

I have these because I'm going to read, I'm going, I'm going to sit there and read them all, you know, leading up to the final thing. So there is a point to it in the end, but there is so much time that's interesting for me. I think that's where I came to that point where I'm like, the only reason I'm keeping these things is because of the fear of missing out of like that one time where I'm like, I really want to watch Big Trouble in Little China right now. Oh, it's there. It's on my. But what I think really kind of was good for me was was when streaming became a real like a real option where I was like, oh, I can just let go of that.

I I went to look for something on Amazon the other night and you know, licensing why sometimes it's on Amazon, but it'll be there. It's always there. Then you click into it and it's like, oh, ways to watch. And then sometimes you just can't watch it. And I'm like, oh, I can't watch that thing. Oh, well, yeah, exactly, right? That's it. I'll find something else to fuck. When I got the the 10-year all-in-one Smallville, you know, DVD thing, I was like, awesome. Now mind you, I owned all the Smallville season collections through like five or six. And I was like, I got to stop. And I sold them all or whatever.

And I I I just put them all in a fuck box and got rid of them because they're low res and I can't watch like anymore. And so now I got to re-buy this fuck in, you know, 4K eventually and then 6K or whatever they come out with. Like I don't know. Yeah, it's the cycle. I mean, so for me, the the real, I think I have an issue with this in a way that you guys don't when it's not even collecting physical fuck. It's collecting digital fuck.

But it's like the amount of time, especially like I'm talking 2005 to 2010, like when uh torrents was huge and you know, the HD was first becoming a thing, an HD video. And you can download stuff. Like I would just spend days, days and days downloading movies, downloading music, downloading everything just because I wanted to have it. And I wanted it to be as organized as possible. I wanted access to it. This is before streaming. Uh but I just kept going and going. I wanted every Disney movie. I wanted every Pixar movie. I wanted every Fast and Furious. You tag them. Like it had to be tagged. Everything had everything in own folder. Own folder. Parentheses. Is it 1080P or is it 720p? Like I wanted to know all that fuck. And when it",

I can always re-rip it. I can always find it again. But there's certain stuff, especially when you are into like weird niche fuck. You're like, if I lose this, I'm never getting this. You know, like random ass Eminem freestyles that he did who the fuck knows where. And you got an MP3 on Napster one time. If you don't get that, you can't Google it and find it.

So all of my media from like before I have an iPhone and between graduating or being in college and getting a digital camera and before getting the iPhone is all in this PS3. And Kevin wanted to borrow it once for his like brother's sleepover or whatever. And I was like, sure.

And all of that is just existing on hard drives. And no matter what I do, like that's gone forever. If there's some weird like electromagnetic current that wipes it all out. Like just to think that your entire life's worth now, uh life's work can be gone like that. And there's no physical evidence that it existed to me is so fuck scary. You know, like painting still exists in museums. Like that painting will always exist even if it's dirty or burned. It exists in some way.
