Colin, you recently tweeted that The Last Guardian was not in the top 10 downloaded games on PSN in December. My question is do you think Sony knows that The Last Guardian was never going to make its money back and that releasing The Last Guardian was more of a nice gesture to fans and an investment on some Goodwill? Also what do you think realistic sales expectations for The Last Guardian should have been? You often mention in the past that games released by NIS and exceed that only sell 50,000 copies can be viewed as successes because those Publishers have realistic expectations for them while Last Guardian isn't as niches those games it's also not as AAA as games like Battlefield or Call of Duty what is the right amount of",
