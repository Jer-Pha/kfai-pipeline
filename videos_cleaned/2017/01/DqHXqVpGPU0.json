This is the first time I played it since the E3 demo uh back in June. We just earlier saw a bit more of what happened after that E3 demo but this is just a different section of the game very early already getting the chance it's going to be a different type of let's play. Uh I don't know how much I'm actually going to be talking during it knowing me I'll probably make a couple clips here and there but I'm going to try to focus on the game opening cut scene action. I'm playing with the Joy-Grip controller, the two Joy-Cons connected to this guy. Open your eyes, wake up Link. The triggers are very clicky kind of reminds me of GameCube uh triggers. The d-pad is interesting too it's weird having a Nintendo d-pad that's not the traditional cross don't how I feel about it yet a little 3DS style button sizewise not a huge fan of but the Pro Controller big old",
