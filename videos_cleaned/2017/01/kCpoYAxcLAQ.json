Final topic of the day, I want to talk about Kingdom Hearts. Okay, HD 2.8. I like how you said final topic of the day and Kevin shook his head in disgust, went long today. Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. How's that roll off the tongue? I played it, I beat it, or I beat at least the sections that matter to me that I haven't played before. Uh, this game, obviously, you guys, I don't know if you are familiar, um, this is a collection of Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance, that was the one that came out on 3DS a couple years back. This is Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep \u2013 A Fragmentary Passage, again, rolls off the tongue, which is essentially, uh, remake of the PSP. This no",

It is a new game. Um, it is kind of a Ground Zeroes. Um, is this the one that runs in the engine for the next G? Yes, this is running, running in the Unreal Engine 4. Um, and so it's, it looks like Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to look. But this is a sequel to Birth by Sleep, which is the PSP game. Um, and it kind of ties into where we're going to be playing Kingdom Hearts 3 story-wise or whatever. Um, and then Kingdom Hearts \u03c7 Back Cover. I've heard people say it's Chi, but I don't know, I don't really understand. They rename the X, they should spell it Chi. They didn't though, they didn't do that. Um, and that's a movie. It's a CG movie that is kind of a retelling with it all added story points, no, of the mobile game that came out, uh, recently, Kingdom Hearts \u03c7.",

And it is like the most early, early, early part of the story. Like it goes back in the timeline earlier than we've ever seen so far. Um, so I watched the movie and I beat the Birth by Sleep \u2013 A Fragmentary Passage. Took me about two hours. So again, it's more of a Ground Zeroes experience or like Final Fantasy Versus XIII, the demo that they put out years ago, Final Fantasy XV. Um, it is Dream Drop Distance. I played before, so I didn't get into it now and didn't really feel the need to. Um, is it worth, you know, full price for essentially just the Birth by Sleep because I doubt many of you want to replay Dream Drop Distance? No, not necessarily. It is cool playing how Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to feel, you know, I like it. The graphics are real pretty, the environments are awesome. The characters",

Like the animals look off because there's something about the humans have more like features and stuff that like I'm like, all right, cool, I buy this, this look on them. Like there's more detail. But like with Mickey, whose face is really just like a circle, yeah, with like other little circles on it, it kind of looks off. Um, I feel like it needs, it needs more, the, the engine it's using and and the style it's using, uh, it could use a bit more shadows, I think.

Uh, from a gameplay perspective, it's Kingdom Hearts and man, it's been a while since I've played a core Kingdom Hearts game and it, it feels good. This is exactly what I wanted. And especially having just come out Final Fantasy XV, uh, which is a very action-heavy, um, game compared to other Final Fantasy and a lot of people compare it to Kingdom Hearts. I'm like, oh no, Kingdom Hearts, I like this ****. And I, I loved the battle system in XV, but this is what I wished it was, you know, this when you first saw the demos of um, Versus XIII back in the day, I was like, this, that I, this, this is the type of gameplay that I fell in love with with Kingdom Hearts over a decade ago.

So, um, this Fragmentary Passage, you play as Aqua, who is one of the main characters in Birth by Sleep. Um, it's great to play as her again. Last time was when Birth by Sleep came out, which I think was like 2007. Um, so it's definitely been a while. Um, story-wise, you don't get too much in this. Uh, it's a little over the top, Kingdom Hearts-esque in terms of dialogue. Uh, and to be honest, I found myself being the least interested I've ever been. Wow. Um, you finally grown up. Just because it's been, and, and, and, and I think there's a, a very, very big reason for that. I feel like on one side of it is Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 even were really about Disney. It's about going to the Disney World, it's doing like the meeting the Disney characters and, you know, everything had to do with that. As the series went on with, uh, they're not spin-offs, but",

But it's like there's three, three dudes that look exactly the same, but they have different names and they're all different versions of the same person. But and it got to a point that I'm playing this, I'm like, I do not remember any, anything at all. And um, hearing the dialogue in, in this game, I'm like, oh man, I don't even care to try to figure it out. And I know that's an insult to a lot of people that love this, but it's just like, it just feels like when I played through Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 a long time ago, I was obviously younger in a different place and",

And that doesn't take away even now from those games, because I love them so much. But I feel like I put up with all the weird anime, um, kind of just tropes because I liked the gameplay and Disney stuff so much. Yeah. Um, when it is just melodrama and like talking about the darkness for the 10th time and my heart this and the light there, and it's just like, holy ****, this is, this is bad. Yeah, this is really bad. But then as it went on, things starting to get a bit more familiar and there's Cinderella's Castle and Snow White's Forest and all that ****. I'm like, all right, all right, cool. Can't wait to see this in Kingdom Hearts 3. But I think that's the problem is this was such a coming out, yeah, such a demo. Um, and such like a, a little, oh, hear, hearing Goofy was a something special for sure. You **** dous. I don't",

I was just, I was a little let down, um, in that sense because I, I want to love this franchise more than anything, but it's like, it just feels like it's giving me reasons to not stay away. Um, but as it, as it ended, I can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 3 even more so. I'm like, all right, cool, because it does seem like it's going to be giving me those things that I want so much. Like they pretty, uh, heavy-handedly explain like, we're getting back to it, all that stuff. Like we're moving past this whole side story characters that we made up ****. Um, and the end of the, of this game, the last, the two-hour experience, well, throughout it, there's boss fights and they're super awesome. This is kind of a Kingdom Hearts game minus the other going to the different worlds, just condense down into two hours to that, to that",

I like it a lot because it, it's, you start off with very limited abilities and you gain all the different abilities, whether it's, um, being able to to roll or jump and do your little glide thing and all that. The combos and stuff, you gain them all really quickly. Um, so I appreciate that. So I did feel a nice sense of progression with the, the battle systems and all that. Camera still just as iffy as it's always been, but that's what happens when you're doing a third-person action game with hundreds of characters on the screen at with the Heartless. Um, but the boss fights are super epic, especially the last two or three in it. And I was really impressed by their scale. It reminded me of like God of War 3. Um, so that's cool. And the, there's a twist at the end that made it all kind of worth it for me.",

So this is how it ties into Kingdom Hearts. All along, Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2, Mickey's in it a lot, which I really like, because Mickey's more of like a, you know, the, the, the Yoda character of the series, where it's like the moments he's there really matter. But with this, he, because you are Aqua, who's a bit higher leveled than like Sora or whoever, I'm sure you're familiar, totally. Them being side by side makes a bit more sense in a way that's not just him saving your ass. So that's super cool. It was hilarious playing the game, uh, with Gia cooking, because like she just keeps seeing this stuff. She's like, wow, the writing in this is **** horrible.

So that was hilarious. Um, but anyway, um, and the, the movie was just even more **** where I'm just like, I just don't understand who the audience is for this, uh, for like all of this weird backstory stuff. And there's obviously a lot of people, because people **** love this game, um, and love the franchise. But I just like, there's something I love about the franchise and then there's all the other ****. And I feel like this game really made me realize that there's a lot more that I put up with to get to the things I like than, um, I think is really worth the time overall.

Because the all these, I feel like this is kind of the answer of making all the side stories worth it, combining together in a way that leads us. This is The Avengers kind of. Well, Kingdom Hearts 3 will be The Avengers. Yeah, yeah. This is, this is the like the Thor movie that you had to watch, so you didn't really want to. Um, um, did you see the story that they, they released about Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy VII Remake? Like I think it was maybe a week ago where they were like, none anytime soon. It was basically, yeah, it was basically a story of just them being like, because everyone's like, everyone think it's stoked. I'm like, no, of course it's not. Of course it's not stoked. That's why they're releasing all these things now to give you a little peace meal approach. Clearly Kingdom Hearts",

Feels like forever and it's going to be forever more. Yeah. So Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is going to be out by the time you're watching this. And then Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX, I don't know what they're actually calling it. Um, it's coming on PlayStation 4 and that's all of the Kingdom Hearts games thus far in HD on PS4 minus, um, the stuff that I just mentioned earlier for this. So definitely cool. If you haven't played Dream Drop Distance, I do think it's worth it because that is a good game and experiencing it in HD is going to be awesome in addition to, uh, Birth by Sleep.

So it would be worth it for you in that case. So now, as always, yeah, we're going to you over at KindaFunny.com/GamescastTopic where you can leave your topic. This episode won't end, Kevin. I'm sorry. Kevin's so angry all over there. Sick as a, when, when did we start that? The last topic. Okay, Jesus. I've never seen him sound worse than this. All right. Uh, we got a question from Ghost Jacobs. If you guys could get the Inside Story on any canceled game, P.T., Agent, Scalebound, et cetera, which one would you choose?

But it'd be awesome to hear like how they, yeah, Norman Reedus and Guillermo del Toro are on board and then like it all starts falling apart and what those conversations are between Kojima and them. Yeah, maybe I'll ask at RTX Sydney. Games wise, I'd probably say Star Wars 1313 just because that looked so awesome. Um, and it was so, so exciting and then for it to just not happen, really sad. But, um, in terms of like juicy stories and ****, I think P.T. is the, the definitive answer. StarCraft Ghost. I don't care too much about StarCraft, but that was such an interesting development as well. Sure, that was a long time ago though.

If you're going to run at 15 frames, that's fine. Just, I mean, it's not great, but it's fine. We just run at 15 frames, you know. Um, I'd be the inverse of Colin and if it was only inverted, like I can't play this. I can't, I don't care how great this game is supposed to be, I can't do it. Yeah, I'm really picky about controls. Uh, for example, in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, I, I just couldn't keep playing it because when you drove the car, you had to use the analog stick, you couldn't use the D-pad. And there's just something about third-person, uh, driving where I like the precision of just, you know, the D-pad kind of moving over slightly.",

So that the analog just always felt off to me. The beginning of that game, you play on the bicycle and it was the same way where you had to use the analog and I was just like, I just can't do this. Like it just bothers me. I know it's such a nitpicky, stupid thing, uh, but whatever. A game has one little control aspect that I'm like, ooh, this just **** feels wrong. It gets to the point that I'm not, I'm, I'm just going to stop playing. Shawn Zulu, how long and crazy have your most insane gaming binges been? I don't know. I haven't had a gaming binge probably since I was a kid.

All the Halo games, we had crazy binges for where there was Halo 1, me and my friends just play Capture the Flag for **** hours and hours and hours. But then when Halo 2 and Halo 3 and 4 came out, we all got together and played through the campaign in one sitting. And that was always a really intense, um, time because I mean, those games, they're not that long, but some of them go upwards of 10 hours. Like sitting straight through, like we would not stop till we beat it. So those were definitely some of my more insane things. Smash Bros.

I mean, that was the whole thing with the wrestling N64 games where I would take the day off school the day after they came out so I could play as, play as long as I could, then sleep downstairs in the TV, you know, video game room and then wake up and play more. Yeah. Um, Movie Buff wants to know, with today's climate, what are games that you think do politics correctly? I feel like this kind of an easy answer, but I think Metal Gear Solid overall has always done a good job of presenting different opinions as convoluted as they are and different perspectives on politics and thinking that way.

I was 11 at the time, so it's not like that crazy. But like that was a game that made me think about what it means to be a president and the people close to the president and all that stuff. I mean, I was, I was, it's funny because I've been pondering the idea of doing politics and games and why it's good and why there should be more. Because I hate when people say to keep your politics and your social stances and everything on the games. I'm like, **** you, you know, like that ****, it makes good art.

Um, and so I think that there is a lot of subtle politics in a lot of games. And, and I like the way games like Banner Saga and, uh, even Final Fantasy Tactics and stuff deal with fictional politics. And, um, and I think that kind of stuff's important. But I think that it's essential that we let this stuff seek, whether it's realistic or based on real stuff like Metal Gear or based totally on fictional stuff like a lot of the games we play. I think it's important that it's there because I think it's a good storytelling devices. That's why House of Cards is so **** good.

And so I think lots of games do that really well. And I think we talked about The Last of Us is another game that deals with a pretty significant social issue very well. So well that it never even touched on in the first game and it only expanded on in the DLC and it made you look at the entire other game differently. And I think that that's cool, you know. Yeah, I think indie games are doing it. A lot of indie games are in the same way Colin's talking about that their art. So people are have a bringing their perspective to it. You know, I'm playing through 2064: Read Only Memories",

You know, I'm playing through 2064: Read Only Memories right now still. And like, you know, one of the big things that's going on in that universe is genetic modification and if that makes you less than human and what if you're doing is it's people who are doing it. You know, Jim Sterling's character in the game is a guy who's fiercely anti that movement, right? And feels that those people aren't human anymore. They're, they're no longer human once they go through this genetic modification or whatever. And to hear that character's arguments and then talk to the people who have been genetically modified and why they did it. It's not, you know, some people are doing it, yes, just for, you know, giving themselves cat ears and tails and stuff because that's their kink or whatever.
