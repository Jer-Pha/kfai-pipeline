Crazy, man. We've been doing this a while. Going, keeps going. Bought all this with it. Mhm, mhm. As always, joined by the cool ding video games, Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. To that point, yeah. Today on the, today on the Morning Show, mhm, we watched, uh, I, we gave away TowerFall Ascension. Thanks, Xbox. And, uh, we watched our Let's Play of it, and it was so jarring to see us in the living room playing Portillo in my lap. Like, us all just sitting on. I like that kind of casual. I still say we will look back one day at those quaint times and have a a buried nostalgia, more innocent times. I agree. I think we will too. But that was the thing.

So what I've decided to do this week is go back to working out. And yesterday, I went, I worked out for the first time on the elliptical for 30 minutes for the first time this year. Yeah. And, uh, couldn't stop coughing when I got off the, off the elliptical, and was coughing sporadically for hours. Ben was at the diner like an hour and a half later, my rice, eggs, and like, you know, take a deep breath. And I'm like, and I'm coughing. I'm looking around like, \"I'm not, I'm not sick. I, I just, I'm just fat.\" And, uh, you know, a little easier today. Just got to shave about five pound 'cause I'm, I'm looking a little more pregnant than usual, you know?

Well, I have a huge head, but a head nonetheless on top of it, comparatively. Uh, but, uh, no, they say if you just cut out sugary drinks, one Coke a day, you lose a pound a month organically. So that would be 10 to 15 pounds a year just based on cutting off the Coke. You've done this too before though. I remember. ****, my metabolism has changed since then though.

The game was announced, I think, pre-E3. But remember, it was just a trailer, and it was people falling out of airplanes, ATVs. Like, \"What the **** is this?\" Yeah. Like, \"All right, cool.\" Yeah. And then last year we had to play it, and we did the little demo. But at the E3 press conference for Ubisoft that last did 10 years, um, they, they did their Let's Play of it, like, Let's Play trailer. And it was just like the most obnoxious thing ever where, right, 'cause it was all the Red Team, Trot Night, Tango, whatever the hell. And like, \"I got your back. I got your blue. I got your blue boy.\" And like, they're doing the whole thing. And it was just like, \"No one ever is going to actually do this.\" And we went",

Remember, that's what I, that's what I always go back to for that E3 that you're talking about, because it wasn't a Let's Play, right? It was just a reacts video. But when we sat down, when we sat down to play it, it was you, me, and two other games journo types, you know, people. And then we had, or no, there was one guy playing from Ubisoft, the dev, one of the devs or whatever. He was Ghost One, exactly. Oh, that's what it was. It wasn't Red Team. It was Ghost One, Ghost Two, Ghost Three, Ghost Four. And we all did talk like that 'cause that's what you see your other people as. You're like, \"All right, Ghost Two, I see you over there.

But when we sat down to play it, yeah, hell yeah, we were doing it. It was fun as hell. It was great. It reminded me of the same year, the, you playing, is it Sea of Thieves, the Microsoft Rare game, where it's like, I thought that game looks like **** garbage. And even, even now, I'm like, I don't understand why people are excited for. A lot of people seem to be really excited about the game. We played it, and it was fun as hell at E3. But that's 'cause everyone's talking like pirates around us. And ****, at home we ain't going to be doing this ****.

So we had a whole little four player squad that was all our own. So Kevin, turn on your microphone. You're going to be part of one. I bet. Yeah. Four players of our own. And it was the same thing though, where there's that moment in video games when you're playing with a crew, and especially when you just start, 'cause you know, we're being dropped into this game of running through and not being able to remember if you're Ghost One. And like, you know, it takes a while to get going. So it is easier to yell out, \"Hey, Ghost One,\" or, \"Who's that?\" Or whatever. And go.

That's offensive, Kevin. But Kevin, his whole goal was to make an entertaining Let's Play video. I **** nailed the **** out of this week on YouTube.com. Kind of shut of what making an end like. I, Nick would be like, \"All right, let's count it down. Three, two.\" I'm like, \"I shot. Was that, that the right time?\" We did keep failing this one very specific section where all I like every shoot the one thing. I'm going to go, you know, run over here. Oh, this, I'm, there was one we failed. Yeah. I'm going to run over and capture this guy. That's when Kev started just shooting whenever he wanted to.

It was one of those perfect examples of Kevin trying to piss Nick off, which is, you know, it's fun. It's fun. It works so well. Yeah, it worked really well. But, uh, the Let's Play, I, I'm really proud of it for Kevin. He's been working really hard on it. It's one of those, the, the Let's Plays that we want to do where it cuts between our face cams and the, the different edits. Four different feeds, four different cams. Yeah. And, uh, it's taking a long time to edit it 'cause this is why we're trying to, trying to hire a new editor. Yeah. Hour long, and it's a, it's a beast. But, uh, it's worth it in the end.

Like, I like it because this game kind of feels unnecessary. Like, I feel like we don't really need, uh, a Ghost Recon right now. Like, there's so many different franchises coming out, especially when it comes to Ubisoft. Like, they're kind of hitting all the targets that we need. And now that they have The Division, and I just feel like this was a game that, especially when it was first announced, it was kind of like a, \"Okay,\" you know? Oh, for sure. When I got first announced, that's how I felt about it until we went and played it. But that's my thing is like, we, we were kind of stoked about",

But that's my thing is like, we, we were kind of stoked about it. But like, now it's weird because it feels less like a, a Ghost Recon game and more kind of like a best of Ubisoft experience. Like, again, that's on my limited experience with those two, what, probably two hours total, maybe two and three if you include E3. Yeah. But it's kind of the open world, do whatever you want to have fun aspects of like a Far Cry with the co-op nature of The Division. Sure. Um, with the Ghost Recon of Ghost Recon, obviously. Uh, but it's, it's just a lot of fun. And, you know, they, they're obviously touting all the, \"It's the biggest world ever,\" and, \"There's all these like, however you want to play, you can play.\" And it's all the, the typical, uh, marketing mumbo jumbo.

And then it, it was like, \"All right, do we want to go down this way on motorcycles or do, do three of us want to get in the car and go?\" And like, no matter what it was, there was chaos and insanity. But it always felt like you weren't lost. Uh, I think that's a big problem in co-op open world games is if you, if your team kind of leaves you behind, you, it reaches a point where you're like, \"Well, I guess I'm not doing helping them out for that part of the mission or whatever.\" But the, these missions seem to be designed around, um, areas that are easy to get to. And because of how the map works and because of the waypoints and ****, I always knew where you guys were even if I wasn't near you.

And it, it was just, it felt satisfying. What I'm interested in, and I, I, I was going to say concerned about, but I guess more interested in is when the game's going to come out, what it's going to net out to be in terms of tone. 'Cause what I like the most about it being a single player guy who enjoys, like, I'm playing The Division again right now. What I enjoy playing that game and jumping in, right? But I felt like, you know, especially endgame wise, The Division when it initially launched was really hard to play by yourself after a while. Um, this one they're touting from the beginning, right? It's, you can play the whole thing **** single player, or if you want, bring in three friends. And it's not, you know, when I was",

And it's not, you know, when I was talking to one of our other friends about it, uh, and he was asking all these questions. The first thing he asked was like, \"Well, is it, is it open world? Do I see other people on the map?\" And I'm like, \"No, no, no, you don't. There's not like, even when you're in your squad of four, there's not four other go, you know, you see dozens of ghosts running around or other people.\" No, it's your, it is your world that you get to exist in. And I like the idea of jumping in on one night, going and running some missions, and then you popping in or Kevin popping in, and we get up and we get and go.

'Cause The Division is, you're in New York, you're getting different gear sets, you're putting on goofy outfits and running around shooting people. And like, there's the Cleaners who are walking around and flame-throwing everything. And there's bosses with tanks and stuff to shoot them.

Like, \"Oh, you got to bail out right now. You're going to die.\" And so like, there's that thing. But it wasn't the game didn't feel like it was making those beats. The game still feels like it's trying to be a serious worth this military thing. The goofiest thing I thought was being able to spawn a vehicle whenever I want to.

Cause the like stepping back and objectively looking at what we're doing in there, the way I would describe the gameplay in the world is it's um Just Cause with the color removed a bit, with that character removed, that cartoony removed. See, for me, it's it's Just Cause mixed with Metal Gear Solid 5 because the I think the gameplay, it is Metal Gear Solid 5. Where Metal Gear Solid 5 is single player, all the missions are variations on here's an encampment, try to find a way into it and either take this person out, take out this person that's there or uh find some data files, **** like that.

Good news, but not Survive necessarily. I mean, who knows, maybe that game is going to be **** awesome, but it's I don't want like the zombie **** already. I'm like, no, that's that's not what I'm but like a Peace Walker, you know, like MGS5 is awesome, but I think that this is it does have that kind of Just Cause um aspect to it that Metal Gear doesn't have and that's where it gets weird getting mashed up. And again, we're a bunch of clowns jumping in at E3 and now this thing, so I haven't been playing for hours and that was the whole thing too for the demo we did, right?

So it was that whole thing of like, man, this seems really hard and I jumped out of the map like, oh, we're in five skull difficulty. And like that was the co-op thing, but if you knew how to play, I'm sure it would have been more balanced. It my concern is always going to be like uh a sneaking co-op Metal Gear sounds fun and Peace Walker was, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't like as in depth and AI thought out as well as Metal Gear Solid 5, right?

And and it's one of those where I think that that I think it can it can have a foot in both and it can do it successfully. It's like what I talk about with Watch Dogs all the time where Watch Dogs I played in my solo playthroughs were constantly like, cool, I'm going to sit on the outskirts of the mission area, send in my drones, do all the stuff, they'll never know I was here.

Yeah, yeah. You got any questions, Colin? No, not really. I I I saw the uh you know, I've seen footage of it and then and there's a new round of stuff kind of coming out now. Uh I think the game looks great. I'm glad you guys I'm glad you guys touched on the Just Cause thing because that that's the the vibe I get from watching the game. I think I think it it's totally Just Cause um and it's just a multiplayer Just Cause.

Uh but the one thing I'm excited about is that again, they are saying it's a different studio, but they're saying the game can be played by itself. And there was there was skepticism about The Division. I thought The Division was a great game and I played it for 40 hours by myself and it was awesome. Um playing it by myself and I think that even though it kind of broke the narrative a little bit, um it made the game. I think there was a special experience to have played The Division by itself, by yourself. I think that it's eerie um man versus the world kind of ****, man versus the city kind of ****. You're a lone wolf. I think that kind of stuff's exciting and fun and it worked in The Division and the skepticism around that, even Greg's skepticism and even my own",

They weren't. They they they told the truth and I'm sure that there's a segment of people that play The Division by themselves. I'm sure it's not a massive segment, but there was a segment, an important segment that played it by itself. Third bestselling Game of the Year by the last year in 2016 was The Division. Um so with this, I believe them and I am looking forward to taking down those maps by myself and uh I think that that will be fun and difficult. It reminds me of again, I another Ubisoft game, Rainbow Six. Uh when I played Rainbow Six 3 when I was when I was young, single player offline. I played it online too, but when I play offline, I'd kill my whole squad and play it by like at the beginning, just cap them all in",

You're so Colin. And so I'm looking forward to doing that with Wildlands. I have no interest in playing this game with anyone and uh never will. And uh but we'll definitely engage with it um because Ubisoft again has that special something in a lot of their games that I think that that speaks to me. I mean, the games that I've been pondering lately, going back to if I had the time, I'm not going to because I think we're going to get Nioh pretty intimately. Then uh Horizon will I'm sure be here in the coming couple of weeks and then you know, we're going to get Mass Effect and all that kind of stuff is uh I've been thinking about Far Cry 4.

So there's something about their games that I like and I'm excited about it, but I don't have any specific questions because they've kind of answered the one question that I that I'm curious about, which is, is it really playable by yourself? And the answer is yes, that's your world, which I like. And I like the idea of cool, this is my map and I'm slowly exploring it. And if yeah, there is a mission that ramps up in difficulty or a mission I want to farm or a mission to play on hard to get this piece of whatever loot, gun, whatever, how it's going to work out, then I can go get friends or vice versa.

Like, yeah, sure, we all just jumped in ad hoc and went in and took down this boss and then left. And that's always fun to do. And I think, you know, one thing that you can't look overlook with with Wildlands, which I think is important and I think it's relevant, it's two things. Number one is that Ubisoft seems to have a dedication to making their games better. And I'm not saying that in a very PR-ish kind of marketing way, they really do. Uh and it gives their games long tails.

And the same thing with The Division. The Division sold way better than I think anyone did with the exception of Call of Duty and Battlefield. The Division out sold everything else that came out last year. That's crazy. I didn't know that. That's like mindblowing. I mean, it's well, that's that's that thing about it is like when The Division was leading up to it and when it came out, that was the **** everyone was playing it. And then for various reasons, people left like I did or whatever. And like and I left because the end game was just like, I do not want to do these same missions over and over again. Like when I I'll never forget signing on and Ty was, I've been doing this for 6 hours because this is the best",

Thank you very much. Yeah, that shit's boring. But to us, but to other people, I I appreciate you like the loot grind. I mean, I do it in my own games. I grind levels and **** nerdy RPGs all the time. But but I like that they stuck with it. The third, you know, the Survival DLCs out now, people are going back, you jump back in. So what I'm saying is that there's reasons to be optimistic about the support of Wildlands and the long tail of Wildlands. Cause I think games like this, whether it is The Division, whether it is Siege, whether it is a game like this to become good at it and to be or Destiny or anything like that, to become good at it, which is not a Ubisoft game, I know, but to become good and to become immersed in it, you really",

And there's only certain amounts of room on the market, as I've said many times, for these kinds of games. Yet Ubisoft keeps putting them out in significant increments that I think is smart. In other words, giving your game like 12 to 18 months to breathe, then assuming that they'll you'll keep us a fragment of that audience and then kind of tantalize them with something new is actually a pretty interesting cycle that they're on. And and I like that they've taken their time. This game has been in development for a long time too. So I'm excited about it.
