Next topic, I got to play Nintendo Switch. You did. I did. One week ago today, you were in New York playing. I was. Me, Big C Dog, taking on the big city. Yeah, so this is the first time officially we're going really deep into my whole experience. We talked a little bit about it on the Kinda Funny Morning Show, uh, but I wanted to give my impressions on everything they had at the event itself. How was the food? The food at the event was not good. Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, not good. They did have Nintendo Switch water. Oh, yes. Did you see somebody selling it on eBay for 100 bucks, which is ridiculous? They had Nintendo Switch cookies that they gave. Kevin ate it. I didn't eat it 'cause it had",

That's what you make the cake, you make the cookie with the fondant. Then it's a work of art and I'm never going to eat it. Yeah, I'm not down, not down at all. But overall, the Nintendo Switch event in New York was a total 180 from the disaster that was the presentation, the press conference. Oh, man, that presentation was so, so, so bad. But the next day, it was so weird because like, you go in and granted, the difference being, very Japanese event. This event in New York, Reggie's there. Uh, and that's something that's interesting about the presentation is that so many of the faces we saw are, we've never really seen before and they kind of shied away from the Reggies and the, you know, Aonuma like",

They sure, they had their moments, but um, it was interesting to to see Reggie speak that that they kicked off the the New York event with Reggie coming out and giving this like 10-minute conversation. He was just like, yo, we're going to be here real quick. I want to wrap up things we announced. I want to tell you some new stuff. I want to get you guys playing the games 'cause I want to get hands-on ASAP. And it was just such a different uh, take 'cause I'm like, where was this? Like, why didn't you just directly tell people the information of boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, bam? 'Cause all of a sudden it sounds more impressive when you do that. Uh, but I, I was most excited when they, they, they let us go play whatever games you want. I walk in, I was like, there's a fair amount of games here playable. Uh, I thought it was going to",

Uh, I thought it was going to be like closer to like five, but they ended up being like 15 or so. Uh, so playable games they had Arms, Zelda, Splatoon 2, Snipperclips, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Fast RMX, Super Bomberman R, Puyo Puyo Tetris, Sonic Mania, Ultra Street Fighter II, 1-2-Switch, Has-Been Heroes, Disgaea 5, Just Dance 2017, and Skylanders Imaginators. Mhm. Now, of those, I played about 10 of them. Lots of Let's Plays up on YouTube.com/KindaFunnyGames. Yes, there is. Uh, the ones I did not play were 1-2-Switch, Has-Been Heroes, Disgaea 5, Just Dance 2017, and Skylanders Imaginators. In addition to that, they had a Super Mario Odyssey like giant trailer loop playing where it just said Super Mario Odyssey Fall or Holiday 2017. And there's just the trailer over and over and over.

Um, but starting off with the games I didn't play, some 1-2-Switch. Wanted to play it. It actually had one of the biggest lines of anything. And I think it's because they, they had like specific booths just for it. And like, they had a bunch of dumbass gimmicky costumes that, yeah, I saw Dan Ryckert and Jeff Gerstmann having the cowboy hats on as they were doing the, you know, the draw game. Yeah, so it's, you know, that was definitely like the kind of the dumb PR uh, area of the event. Whereas like, there's all the people like, come on, have fun, let's put on costumes. How many ice cubes are in this glass? Exactly. So we, we didn't get to play that. But looking back on it, I actually regret that because that is the one game that really",

Uh, so I wish that I had the the chance to do that 'cause from speaking to everybody after, they're like, oh, fuck, like, no, you should have definitely tried that for the different mini-games and stuff they have. Um, people seem to be to think that that game is pretty good based on people that have actually played it. Yeah, I kind of wrote it off just like I'm sure many people did is, 'ugh, it's just more Nintendo fuck party game.' And I feel like that's what it is. I mean, if people played it and they liked it, fine. But I feel like that still is what it's going to be. Yeah, cool, we got it. We played Zelda for a while. Now let's screw around with this real quick. All right, cool. We did the quick draw on the Morning Show. Bye. That's, you know what I mean? Exactly. I think that the uh, the what going for",

I think that the uh, the what going for, and I appreciate it, is they are going for more of a Jackbox Party Pack feel where, or like a Cards Against Humanity. Like, it's less, we play and we sport and like that stuff where it's more like your whole family can play this. This is more, this is not about family as much as it's about a party. Like, this is like, you're drunk with your friends, we're milking cows. Because it was really funny to to see people play. How long does that humor last? Probably not too long. But depending on how many mini-games there are, again, didn't play it, not standing up for it. But everybody that played it seemed to be really into it. It does seem like, yeah, like we talk about when you get VR, what are you going to, what game are you going to show? Exactly. Hey, cool, you're here for a few beers and, oh, yeah, I have a Switch.

Uh, Has-Been Heroes looks like a Colin game if I've ever damn seen one. I didn't have time to play it, but it looks like an indie game. Uh, it's coming to PS4, Xbox One, and Switch at the same time, sometime later in this year. Disgaea 5, not my type of game, didn't play it. Just Dance 2017, it's the same setup we've seen for six years where there's like six girls just like standing there, come on, dance with me. And it's like, no one's fuckin' doing it. Kev's like, I'll see you guys later. Walked in 40 minutes later, came sweating. But it's always, but then they always get the one guy to go play and it's just like one random ass game.

He doesn't want to be there for the people that are playing, having fun, good for you. But, oh, man, you just got roped into it. No, no one's happy about that. The siren song. Oh, so bad. And the Skylanders Imaginators, I didn't need to play. Skylanders already out. Yeah, I was just there, whatever. Um, I did not, so I didn't play it, but I did use Skylanders as an excuse to be able to hold the controller more. Nice. You know, you walk by, you're like, what, what demo has nobody? Oh, Skylanders. Yeah, great. I'm a big fan. I got the Crash uh, amiibo too. Thanks. All right, but no, you didn't even start it, sir. That's pretty much exactly what it is.

I'm already here. Just let me see. It's fine. Just let it happen. And uh, we experienced that a lot. Like where there was a lot of times like, all right, I just want to use the Joy-Cons or I just want to play on thing. And they're like, no, you for this demo, you're doing it like this. And it's just like, yo, fuck off, let me play. And I think that's another thing with the Switch because there's so many different control options. So many of the demos had different controllers.

But Imaginators was one of the only um, systems to have the, I don't even know what they're calling it, but I guess this the Switch standard where it's like the the screen, the Joy-Cons attached. I don't know, does it have a proper name or is that just the Nintendo Switch like when configuration? 'Cause I keep calling it Gamepad, but it's not Gamepad. But whatever. So I did that to be able to for um, anyway, so those are games I did not play. Games I did play, Arms. Super, super good. Compared to super good to where, yeah, it, it's not going to be great.

But like classic Nintendo, this looks like nothing. And then it actually has a cult following afterwards. And it's a great game that people really bite into. Uh, the, there's something about the characters in this game playing it that there, there's a personality where I'm like, all right, this kind of reminds me of a combination of them nailing the motion control. So it's like Wii Boxing, but there's depth behind it. So it's kind of like the Wii Punch-Out game, but with more um, precise controls with the being able to turn your hands and all that combined with the like characters of Overwatch and like really focusing on them as the the main focal point of the game. Sure, with something like Smash Bros. that it's",

So adding those things together, I'm like, there's definitely something there way more than just, oh, we're going to punch each other. It's not Wii Boxing 'cause that you, when they debut, we're all like, it's just Wii Boxing again. Yeah, and I think in the same way when Splatoon was debuted, it was just like, this is their answer to Call of Duty. Like, it's, it's real easy to be snarky about it. And again, I don't think it's going to set the world on fire, but I do think it's going to be way more impressive than people give it credit for. Playing it, I'm amazed at how intuitive it was. I did the Let's Play with Jimmy Wong and you can even see in the video like, we wrap our heads around the controls and understand how to do things that at least feel",

'Cause like for so long with even with Wii MotionPlus, it was fighting against the controls to get it to do what you wanted to do. But you can see in the Let's Play when I want to throw, which is quite often, uh, as you, as a lot of people in the comments have pointed out, uh, I was meaning to do that. You know, I saw he wasn't blocking against throws, so I kept going with that. There wasn't any single time that it didn't throw when I wanted to throw. There wasn't any time where I didn't move or punch when I wanted to. So I was like, oh, fuck, like, is it sad that I'm giving a game credit for working a little bit?

Interesting, interesting. It's going to be a lot better that way. Uh, I think for in terms of competitive play. But it's fun with the motion controls. And I do think that it's a perfect example of a game um, that when your friends come over to show off the Switch. And just like it was a fun thing. A Pokk\u00e9n was the other game I wanted to compare to earlier. Uh, in terms of the the view perspective of playing.

Uh, because, you know, everybody gets so upset at them relying on the same cast over and over and over. At least, at least they're trying. Uh, Zelda, obviously, it's fuckin' fantastic. I can't believe they're going to play in less than six weeks. Be able to just get lost in that world. And it's a damn big world. So much so that playing it on the the handheld mode, I'm like, I don't know if I need this handheld. It's freaking crazy. Like the graphics, 720p on the screen.

Reading is fine, but it's like having Link and just seeing the world, it's just like, it's a little overbearing. Um, I definitely preferred playing it on the TV. Um, I got to play Zelda in the most configurations out of any other game where I played in handheld mode. I got to play with the Joy-Con Grip controller on the the thing. And um, I played with the two Joy-Cons on the screen. And all the control options felt great. None of them felt any noticeably better or worse than the others for Zelda.

There's no tutorial that you just jump in and it's just like, holy fuck, like, this is a very un-Nintendo move. You know, it's like, this is beating over the head. This what we want from from Zelda. And this is the same demo from E3. So it's not like you you start with your sword, right? You know, got a wood sword and a wood shield. Same demo from E3. Um, but now playing on Nintendo Switch. So I played it before on Wii U. This, so now it's, I didn't notice the difference just playing. Uh, there's a whole bunch of graphics comparisons on the internet where you can see like, oh, fuck, it does look substantially better on on Switch. But I didn't notice playing got at all.

Um, so I saw a little bit more of that. The the, I feel like people aren't talking about the cons of Breath of the Wild as much as they they should be. Um, the controls are pretty bad. Like you were talking, you you were worried about this being you when you started talking to me about it. I think over lunch we were talking about being antiquated like Last Guardian, right? Yeah, I mean, it, it, it definitely gives me Last Guardian vibes. Jump is with triangle or whatever the top button is. Yeah, I'm just used to DualShock.

And I'm just like, oh, man, like, this, this is, that's not good, Link, what are you doing? I'll just say my takeaway from my time with it at E3 was, you know, was brief, but I felt like it was complicated. That was, that was my major thing. I was like, like, well, this does this and you can do this with your shield and you can do this, you can slide down and then you can grab a bomb and then do this. Oh, you hit.

I'll be interested to see if that was just me or there, me being new to the game. Yeah, that would, right? I would hope so. But it seems, it seems like there's a lot to do. And so, but I mean, that'll all be introduced slowly, you'd assume, right? Granted, even though you're dropped in without a tutorial, you're not going to have all your bombs. You're not going to have all your like swords or uh, bow and arrow stuff. I mean, even now, having played through the same demo a couple times, like, I do feel like I do have a better grasp of how to do all the different systems. So it is less, you know, crazy uh, to come at. But that was my big, I was shocked when I played. I was like, this is complicated, dude. Like,",

There there wasn't an invert option for the demo, but there was a menu that I couldn't get to. So I'm assuming that it's in there. Um, but anyway, I mean, it, the game is fantastic. Like, just from the very little I've played, like, this seems like the Zelda game that I want to play. You know, and Skyward Sword, I, I liked. I don't hate it as much as everybody else.

Like, the controls are pretty damn weird, especially having just beat Last Guardian. I'm like, oh, this feels like that. You know, so we'll see how that goes. Uh, Splatoon 2, me and Kev did a little bit of playing of it. Um, I'm not a huge Splatoon guy. Not that I don't like the game, it's just I, I just never really like got into it. So I'm not good at it or anything. But they had a huge setup where you could play with a bunch of people at once. Um, that was another game. Had various control options to be able to do. But it was also another one that I picked up just to kind of play with the um, portable or portable mode, handheld mode, handheld mode. Hand, who the fuck calls them handhelds these days? Nintendo.

It's a little eShop game. It's a co-op physics-based puzzle game. Super fun. Cannot wait to to play through it. We should do a whole Let's Play series or just a long Let's Play of us playing through. It's super awesome. There's Let's Play up on Kinda Funny Games with me and Danielle Bloodworth from Easy Allies. We had a great time with it.
