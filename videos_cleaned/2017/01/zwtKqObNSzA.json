We figure out a way for this not to happen and store your stats locally and go and put it all up.\" Crocodile Game: Where's My Water? This is just a crocodile and now he's just in a bathtub just doing some stuff. What's he should be concerned about the water? He needs that water.

Then there's the other side that are at the cash cow ones, the the free-to-play microtransaction shit ones that like give mobile gaming such a bad nature. And luckily Mario doesn't do that stuff well. But then it's funny because like so much of the criticism now is that Mario Run is not a major success financially and on stuff. It's like, \"Well, that's because they didn't nickel and dime on this dumb shit.\" But it is a huge success compared to the quality game. So is that a success right at getting us hardcore people who actually care about a mobile game and pick it up and beat it all interested in it? Like this is one of those ones where I can't remember the last like, I mean everyone was talking about this, right? And I guess Pok\u00e9mon Go would be the last time I saw our influence, our echo chamber, our Twitter list be everybody talking about these coins and doing all these different things.

Brian Altano are tweeting about like all around IGN that in the office that day all you heard was coin sounds. Yeah, playing it. I mean, that's awesome. And I think the other side of that is that this is the type of game that's getting a lot of people that are familiar with Nintendo to actually play a Nintendo game. Gia played this. She is still playing this shit. And it's weird. I'll see you're like sitting there playing like, this is super random and I would have never expected it. But there's something about Mario that's like, okay, even though it's the same game that we've already gotten a million times on mobile, it's like now all of a sudden it makes sense. It's Mario that's one-handed so she can hold the glass of wine and exactly exactly. She's really good at it. She's I mean, she's not really it isn't a lie but just",

She's I mean, she's not really it isn't a lie but just left. Why'd you do that? He keeps hit like she just like, I'm trying to tell her how to wall jump. No, that's not gone over well. Lord God, she the girl could not wall jump. I can just see that you garden. So a big compliment I want to give the game is it reminds me a lot of Sonic 3 & Knuckles in the sense that it is very tier based because that there's so much verticality to it. It really is kind of like Sonic 3 & Knuckles or Star Fox 64 in the sense that there's the tiers of if you go high it's harder, if you go mid it's medium, and if you go low it's easy. And I think that there's a it's brilliant level design when you add the coins to kind of guide that non path and to be able to see like each level has three different levels in it because you know, in addition to the kind of challenges on top",

And once you say that this is them taking some MOBA influences because they have the lanes. No, of course Colin knows as an on this undefeated eSports champion. You got the three lanes there. You got your three lanes. Those lanes, there's no difficulty difference between the lane really. Yeah, it's not the way it was explained to me when of course we were playing the best one ever, Infinite Crisis. I don't you know, I mean, I don't know. Anyway, I like it a lot. And another thing that I've been saying a lot is that my favorite games are platformers and rhythm games. So there's something about this that kind of melds those two together. So rhythm to it right in a really cool way that on my I'm totally down with. And I feel like Rayman does a way better job of it. Did you play Rayman Origins and Legends?",

Did you play Rayman Origins and Legends? Then what? Yeah, the ones that came in via. Yes. So you know the levels where there's the music playing, you're kind of like, yeah man, whatever. The Rayman mobile games were kind of inspired by that. So it is just like very simple button presses but it's like they add on to and there's like this really nice growth of they eventually had a punch button so you can jump and punch and it just becomes this like rhythm platform thing. And I feel like Mario kind of did a good job of taking that rhythm but then also adding gameplay to it and having the the pause blocks and the go into different directions and stuff and really trying to think about stuff and having a bunch of like nice fun like throwbacks and stuff like when you go there's certain levels where if you cross the right side of the screen you",

So it's a there's a really good game design in this and it is really fun. I just think that there's too much bloat and shit around it to like make it something that is super incredible must-have. Yeah, yeah. But it's is it worth $10? I can't say yeah, once they had updates and stuff maybe. I think that is this would have been an amazing $3 game. It's a good $10 game. Gotcha. Yeah, in terms of sales and shit. And so Super Mario Run had grossed 30 million in revenue since the 15th of December. Evidently was downloaded 90 million times. The only three million of those purchased the full game at $9.99. That's a conversion rate of 3.4%. A notable decrease is the",

A notable decrease is the game's launch day when roughly 10% of users were buying full time. These figures all pretty good are nowhere close to breaking Pok\u00e9mon Go's record of earning 800 million in 3 days. But again, different type of games. Cash front. Yeah, cash upfront versus microtransaction shit. So we'll see. I'm interested in what they do next. But I think that it's it was a very important and good move for them going into the Switch to get Nintendo back in a positive light in people's minds, like the mainstream people's minds. And also now everyone has a Nintendo Account, whether or not I'm complaining about it. Like millions of people have accounts that did trip forth.

Yeah, are you fucking excited? Yeah, I'm very excited. It's gonna be super interested. Yes. Yeah, I can't wait to see if they fuck it up. I don't think they're going to. I don't think so either. I think I feel good. I feel super good about it actually. They're making all the right moves. Touch me in all the right places. Do you think they come out on the same day as Mass Effect? Are they gonna try to swerve around? Does that matter anything? Where's that? Where's that at all?

I was I was very heartened to see the 3 percent conversion rate simply because you know, conventional wisdom on mobile says that Nintendo would have made more money as as we saw in Antic, in The Pok\u00e9mon Company with Pok\u00e9mon Go, had they made it free-to-play. And people were saying that it wasn't nearly this this meteoric success in the time given. But I would argue that Pok\u00e9mon Go requires much more maintenance and upkeep. It's not my say Mario or this new Mario game is is necessarily a static product, but it is not this geo-located constantly adding new shit to it, constantly having to deal with server problems and people kind of coming on and all these kinds of things. I would say that Nintendo is probably very pleased with the amount of money they made, the net profit",

And and between these three games, they're just experimenting with different things. The mobile market, as I've argued many times, has really destroyed expectations for what video games should cost. And there are certain companies are trying to buck that trend. I think we saw that a little bit with our friends at Chair Entertainment, but we saw that more notably I think with with Square Enix. And now we're seeing with Nintendo where people are saying like, well, premium games should be worth a premium amount of money. And my biggest takeaway was all the kind of gathered Twitch tweets and Facebook messages that people were circulating when the game came out about how people couldn't believe that the game was $10.

I think you have to just shake these people up and make them understand that the race to the bottom has been very destructive and that you cannot have games of quality on a mobile platform for no money. And so I think Nintendo is doing good work that is stewarding a new way to look at games on mobile platforms that will be at the to the benefit and help of other publishers and developers moving forward. The more of them get that get involved and the more of them that that dare charge more money and maybe eat a little bit of shit at the beginning in order to set the new precedent for the ecosystem, I think is very positive.
