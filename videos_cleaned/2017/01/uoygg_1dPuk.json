Yeah, I'm like, alright, this is gonna be something different and something unusual and something cool. And I was hoping, I was hoping very much that I would like it. And sure **** when I went saw it, it got me. I'm like, this is a modern-day musical. Musicals for the most part don't really exist anymore unless there's something huge happening on Broadway or someone decides to revive, yeah, older already established musical. But this is an original musical that has been made into a movie. This by all accounts shouldn't have happened, right?

Can you name the last musical you saw that wasn't a Disney film? I mean, I mean, uh, I think that this movie came at the perfect time. I think that we've been primed for this for so many years that my generation with things like High School Musical and with all the Disney animated musicals that's mentioned. Hamilton's doing well, Book of Mormon, there's stuff like that in South Park that was a music that was '98. I know, I'm just, I'm just so exactly. But I'm laying the groundwork for why, yeah. And you know, I feel with the rise like we recently got to talk about musicals. I'm Hairspray and Captain or Peter Pan and the musical lives. Yeah, yeah, like that. I think that we're at a perfect place for for this movie to come out and it it was magical. It was such a good movie experience and like I don't even judge it as",

What for me the most surprising thing is I remember seeing the trailer as well and being like, that looks fun, awesome, not realizing it was a musical. But it was the one they started like floating into the air and like the planetarium, I guess, whatever is what you like what your time with that running. I'm kissing. Not to mention that like I was like, I've talked in previous things about like, I like The Rock and I like Kevin Hart. Is there a picture? Sure, sure, I'll go see it. I like Emma Stone. I like Ryan Gosling a lot. So like to have them back together in the movies like, oh yeah, **** that looks great.

Oh man, great trans thing movement, right? Well, that's Suicide Squad. Oh God, no. I mean that, you're right though. When I first saw the trailer, I was like, I'm seeing this movie. Like you guys won me over. You did your job with this. This looks epic. This looks amazing. And it was, it paid off in every single way. And what I enjoyed the most about it was once it ended, I had experienced so many different emotions throughout it. And I feel like all of them were earned. And I liked that even at the end of it, there was things that I'm like, oh man, why didn't they do this? Or this could have happened differently or whatever. But it's like, it felt good.

Like non-spoilers, movies great. Go see it. Come back and watch the rest of this video. Now we're going 2016. My favorite movie by far of 2016. It was so good and I could not recommend it more. I've been listening to the soundtrack every day. That's it. Yeah, me too. Yeah, you know, if I'm listening, if I'm working at the computer or if I want, you know, like in the morning when I put stuff on my Bluetooth speaker in the bathroom, I've been listening to it too.

Then it's the more like, this is what could have been. I like that they did it on a more on the actual soundstage that we saw earlier in the movie. Yeah, and it was that they recreated the movie as if it was an old-school musical. And I like that that's open to interpretation not only of is this supposed to represent what could have happened or is it supposed to represent what did happen in a just different time, alternate timeline? Or is this supposed to represent what would have happened if this was a musical that was made '50s? Because I like the whole style that they did of like recreating all the different things practically, even though earlier we saw like the planetarium scene or whatever the traffic thing was all, you know, huge.

What did you take away from the ending? His Nick and I, we have talked about it. You talked about it. You took away something completely different than what I did. Go ahead. Well, me, I took away the that the extra thing was just more of like a step back meta thing of this is what the musical version would have been. Okay, of this. For me, what they showed is that's what happened. Oh, sure. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, the movie they split up. Out for me, when I watched it all happen in I for me, it was happening in her head. This was her vision of like, **** what if, what if he had gone with me to Paris? What if, you know, we had been together and it was this perfect love",

You you told me that it you took it from Gosling's perspective. Um, I think originally I did, yeah, because I think that they kind of the way the cinematography lends itself in that scene, if I remember correctly, kind of pushes your you toward that. But I don't think I necessarily defined it when I was watching. I just thought this is what this was their sort of they saw actually they walked in and this was sort of what their shared experience was when they were thinking what their lives could have been. And I think that they both kind of came to that conclusion at the end that like that although it would have been good, it still would have been missing something. I think that no matter what",

And I think you see that in that look when she walks out and she looks at back at him, he looks at her and he smiles and she smiles back at him. Like there's that that that just acknowledgement that hey, everything kind of turned out the way it was supposed to. I think Kevin, what did you turn on your mic? What did you say? Cause you were you it was another one where I was talking to you about it. You think he's unhappy at the end of the movie? Yeah, so I I kind of saw it more towards Nick, like the way Nick originally saw it, where that that was him playing out what would have happened if he hadn't gone and like had gone with her essentially. Yeah, he wouldn't have gotten his dream. But like before that happens",

He just seems so, I don't know, this there seemed to be like a sadness in who his character was. It seemed like how he was in the beginning of the movie where he was all by himself and he just didn't seem happy. Was it in in the the scene epilogue scene where it's the flash, you know, also universe would have? Yeah, it is. Didn't we also get the club in that as well? No, in the in that universe, hum noise kuai club. And he realizes that someone else has his dream. Got it. Okay, so he looks up and sees someone else playing playing a piano, an amazing jazz club that's like everything he's wanted in his a look on his face where you kind of get the feeling that like, and I don't remember her faces.

Um, but there's a moment where he just kind of looks and there's like a dazed look on his face where he's like, **** like that's what I'm that was my dream and I didn't I sacrificed something to get that. And I think that's just kind of your eye. Someone the comments remind me what was the name of the club? Seth said set in wind is in the dream. Oh, I don't remember like that. Cause that's the thing to me that I could have sworn it was his as well. But I mean, whatever that does totally change. Yeah, I think I want I'm gonna go see it again with Jen.

What, granted, I'm listening to it, but I am still thinking about it the same way. Yeah, nah man, it's so, so good, and I think that the what did I take from it from the end like epilogue aside? I really appreciate the fact that it didn't to me feel like this is the only way it could have happened. And I think that the epilogue kind of shows that the moral the story isn't you either choose love of your dreams and it's not that you have to do this or that and you can't do both. It's that there's a lot of different options that can have it. And this is just one of the ways that this went because I feel like they were so perfect together and everything made so much sense of the moment when it's she's like, I",

He's like, I can't go to Paris. I was like, really? Yeah, why can't you? Like what, why can't you? But it was just like, I really took that as that was just a decision made because he like he really felt at that moment after everything that happened. We after he did totally change the course of his dream to get her. Like I think that the the use of City of Stars throughout the movie, how it keeps coming back in different ways is really the thematic through line of the entire movie. And like when it turns to the scene of them in the apartment and they're singing together and it's not perfect because they're both not trained singers and they kind of **** up and just kind of laugh it off. And that was the take that they used. I love that because they're so representative of this isn't a",

I love that because they're so representative of this isn't a perfect story. Nothing about this perfect. It is what it is. And that's the point where City of Stars stops being about the dream and says, all we ever needs love. Like this is about love. And then later it turns back to being about dreams and it's not about love anymore. And it's I just think it's cool because it is an evolving thing where people grow with each other and they help each other become different people. Yeah, I think that's that was perfect. That's well said. I think that was kind of what hit me, what struck me too, was I think this is one of the best romance movies I've ever seen in that it does what all really good romance movies do and that it doesn't necessarily need a happy ending to be a good and enjoyable experience, right? It reminds me of all those relationships I've had in the past",

You were in that moment and everything was perfect. And then for some reason it just kind of took a different turn and dissolved. And that's just what happens to people. That's what happens. It's life. It's not even a matter of youth. I was gonna say it's what happens to you when you're young, but it just it happens no matter what. Like, yeah, sometimes you hold on to something really tightly and sometimes it just you gotta let it go. And I think that that was that was so beautifully done in that. And I don't I don't see it as an unhappy ending by the way, cause I think they both look to me like he looked like he loved that Club and he was enjoying being that person. And like they were always gonna think about",

Yeah, but at the same time when they see each other and there is that look at the end when they smile, they both realized that they were in that moment what they needed for each other. Yeah, to pass into that next part of their life. And then that's it. Another thing that I really, really enjoyed about the movie is that it kept throwing curveballs, but not in a predictable way and not in a way where you expect them to constantly be switching things up and you know, so you're you're trying to get ahead of the movie because that's something that movies do a lot work. I as a creative type liked to watch these things and think what, where's this going? You know, what are they gonna do? This movie I kind",

You know, what are they gonna do? This movie I kind of it beat me. Like I didn't even I stopped thinking about that because like I trust them. Like they've won me over enough. Like when they introduced John Legend's character, it was intriguing. It's like, alright, this guy's obviously like the bad guy, you know? But but why? Cause they set him up like, oh, he's a bad guy. They almost immediately switch that on you and you're just like, no, he's a good guy. Just represents this dream that Ryan Gosling doesn't have. And it adds this whole new element to it that it's no longer is it just love and dreams. The idea of success is also thrown in there. And success not being your dream. It's like, alright, if you succeed at being successful, what's that worth compared to love and um, your dream, right? It's like nothing because he gets that. He gets all this fame. He it's all",

And to me, the movie is such an emotional roller coaster and it got so real. And I I love that every person I've talked to you about it glean something differently from it, whether it's from the relationship standpoint or the dream standpoint. It's a success standpoint. And watching it with Gia was really difficult because when they started having the fight about the there's one line in particular at the apartment when he goes to visit her.

But the line of so when does this stop? And he's like, wanna know, we're doing the album to make the tour. And then we're doing the tour to make the next album or whatever. I was just like, like Gia looked at me in a way, oh God, this is literally like things that we've had. It's like, well, I'm doing Kinda Funny Lives. And then I'm editing it so that other people can see it so we can go bigger next year. So, you know, I'm right. All ****. But it's like, I love that though. I love how that builds.

Yeah, I liked I liked that scene too. Now, like I love the fact that he's doing something that he is conflicted about, right? He's doing something that he realizes is giving him success and can ultimately build toward that ultimate goal of his. But he but the reason why there's animosity and the reason why there's an anger and he has that line later that he says it is really you mean, but he just says it was like, are you mad? Somebody kind of like, are you mad at me because you can't stand to see me succeeding and your while you while you're not while you're just standing one place?

And a lot of people are like, what? He could have just gone to Paris with her. And I'm like, he could have gone to Paris with her. But I think that scene was pivotal for that because he talks specifically about like, he's already done this other thing for her. And that's led him to a place that he didn't it's he doesn't want to be either. So I think like, stay the course and get your club or go to the to be on with his woman and probably not do what you want to do in life. That was his that was his crossroad.

I mean, taken away from my take away from it in terms of the relationship standpoint, right?
