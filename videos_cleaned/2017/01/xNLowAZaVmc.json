A pleasure to be in your homes and house tonight to watch this alongside you. I'm gonna start taking some notes over here. I wanna make sure I don't miss anything, it's happening. Can't build the trees. Well, this just explodes with the time, that's it. Miyamoto comes out, he's like, Nintendo is canceled. What, no Mr. Miyamoto, no! Nintendo is, says it in perfect English. Boogie just pimped our screen, no wonder our things are out. We love you Boogie, thank you so much. Perfect English? This was all a ruse, I'm actually from Cincinnati. Fooled you.

Many people around the world watched the Nintendo Switch video we released in October of last year, and reacted quite positively to it. This video introduced the Nintendo Switch console, Nintendo Switch Dock, Joy-Con Grip, and two Joy-Con controllers. Translators like to hear me's words for the first time. As well as the Pro Controller. Nintendo Switch is a console that can be played while connected to your television, but it is also a system you can bring with you to share the fun wherever you go.

Thanks chief. In today's presentation, we intend to provide a detailed introduction to the Nintendo Switch hardware and software. I'd like to begin by introducing the Nintendo Switch launch date, suggested retail price, and online services. Nintendo Switch will release simultaneously on March 3rd, 2017 in Japan, the US, Canada, major European countries, Hong Kong, and other territories. More European countries that aren't major. Luxembourg, Malta. This is the suggested retail price for Nintendo Switch. In Japan, it will be 29,980 yen. It's $30. Clapping, one clap. In North America, it will be $299.99. Colin was right about that. Not the date. For the price in Europe, please check with your local retailer. Okay. Next, I have information about Nintendo Switch online services. Oh shit.

And when you use a smart device application that will connect to Nintendo Switch, you will be able to invite friends to play online, set play appointments, and chat with friends while enjoying online matches and compatible games, all from your smart device. Users will be able to try out Nintendo Switch online services for free during a trial period after launch. Then, it will become a paid service beginning in the fall of 2017. We will provide additional details on this paid service and its features on our homepage at a later date. You don't have much time. I have an additional piece of information.

Here, I would like to switch over to the man responsible for all software development for Nintendo Switch and mobile applications, Mr. Shinya Takahashi.

Nintendo 64 offered the world's first analog control stick, and it introduced a rumbling controller with the development of the Rumble Pak. We put a handle on Nintendo GameCube so it could be carried around. Even at that time, we were considering a home game system that you could take with you, but it seems we were a little too soon. Nintendo DS added a touch screen. With the Wii remote, motion control became possible. And the Wii U GamePad enabled you to play games off the TV. He's here, boo.

You can connect over Wi-Fi for multiplayer battles. And up to eight Nintendo Switch systems can be connected for local wireless multiplayer gaming. What do you think? With its three play styles, Nintendo Switch evolves gameplay, making it more active and offering greater freedom of play. And what makes this possible are the Joy-Con controllers.

But it's also like shooting, where you aim and fire at distant opponents. To play Arms, you hold one Joy-Con in each hand in a thumbs up pose. Our friend Rahul on Twitter, Oh shit, another game, no one will play on March 4th. So when you punch, your character also punches. Now Nick, are you following so far? When you twist your fist, your punch curves. With this, you can pursue a distant enemy. You move your character by tilting the Joy-Con. And by combining dashes and jumps, you can perform a variety of actions. Because Arms uses physical controls. Holy fuck, the game is called Arms and I just realized how eager I am to fucking die.

It has been about two years since I first discovered the squid, and it seems there have been many changes to the squid world in that time.

This is a fearsome weapon in the hands of one who has mastered it. And it appears the special weapons, which can be activated after spraying enough ground with ink, are all brand new.

I am very excited to once again enjoy those exciting times with everyone all around the world. Sounded better in Japanese. Still, as many elements that we have yet to uncover. The Squid Research Lab will continue to share new details as we discover them. If we shut down the Squid Research Lab, can we cut $10 off the console's price? Get that bad boy down to $89.99. What squid do you think? This brand new version of squid arrived this summer. It should make for some hot matches. Squid, what squid do you think? Now we're switching again. The new Donk City.

While I am the overall producer for the Nintendo Switch hardware, I simultaneously have a hand in the newest Mario game, Super Mario Odyssey. This is the first time since Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine that we have created a large Mario sandbox world like this for you to run around in. The theme of Mario this time is a journey to an unknown world, and Mario has jumped out of the Mushroom Kingdom to go on an extraordinary adventure. I said unknown, but perhaps you notice some landscapes that look familiar from the real world. And, at the end of the video, perhaps some of you have noticed some unusual eyes or something on Mario's cap. They're on your twoser. Right there. This",

I hope you'll look forward to it. In the 0 years since we made Super Mario 64, I have been on a long, long journey together with Mario. And we are working on this new journey called Nintendo Switch with the excitement one feels when visiting unknown countries for the very first time. I'll be very happy when you can all join me in departing on this new Mario journey on Nintendo Switch. We plan to release Super Mario Odyssey in the holiday season. Oh, dammit! Jesus God!

The Nintendo Switch concept has resonated with many developers, and there are currently over 50 companies working on games. And there are already over 80 games in development. So today, we'd like to introduce just a few of them. Square Enix has already announced that they are preparing Dragon Quest X and Dragon Quest XI for release on Nintendo Switch in Japan. Slam! Blue slam! But there is another Dragon Quest game making an appearance. Dragon Quest Heroes 1 and for Nintendo Switch. Now, take a look at this. Got the fucking snap noise. Die Hard the game. Atlus!

I am Toshiro Nagoshi from SEGA. SEGA sees a tremendous amount of appeal in Nintendo Switch and we intend to be present on the platform. And similarly, I as an individual creator sense a new kind of appeal with this game hardware. We will consider new games for Nintendo Switch and we will present them soon. This new hardware is taking on new challenge and has a lot of appealing points. And I would like to take advantage of this new concept and create an interesting game.

Now you can play Skyrim wherever you want and take it on your own adventures. But what's really exciting is for all of us at Bethesda to finally work with Nintendo. I still can't stop laughing about this. Project Octopath Traveler. The fuck does that mean? It looked cool. Why is that the name? Are there eight paths?

Like I know that word and fuck. So this one game that I'm working on right now will be something that will take advantage of this environment that is easy for indie developers to create a game. And so we will have a game that will have a fusion of deathmatches and strong styling, sort of heavily involved, heavily influenced by pro wrestling. And I'd love to see Travis running around in a game for Nintendo Switch. Thank you very much for your time today. It was Grasshopper Suda51 signing off. Alright.
