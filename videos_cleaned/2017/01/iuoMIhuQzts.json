You went down to LA, you played this game. Yeah, I did. Is it good? Uh, Horizon Zero Dawn is **** awesome, totally awesome. Um, you're going to see it here, we're going to go through it. I what spoke to me about it was the fact that it is so many of my favorite kinds of games combined. You see Uncharted there, this is an RPG like The Witcher. I feel like it has Last of Us influences because we're dealing with the, you know, the destruction of our world. Uh, there's this sci-fi to it with this you're about to jump in and see it is also Fallout. These conversations strike me so much like Fallout for for good and bad obviously. Like this is the part where you're like exactly and I when I edited this footage together went to LA played with a whole bunch of other games media types. A bunch of weird restrictions for it uh for what we can show you what we can't show you basically.",

A bunch of weird restrictions for it uh for what we can show you what we can't show you basically we can show you 0 minutes of footage so I've edited 0 minutes of footage together of that 0 minutes nothing can be longer than five minutes in terms of a chunk. The reasoning behind this from PlayStation is the fact that so much of this game is traversing the land that they don't want you to think that this is boring because you're watching it out and you're not doing it cuz let me tell you right now this is awesome. I talk to that woman I'm on a side quest I'm going to go find her brother but on the way I see a boar off to my right, a turkey off to my left. I decided to take out the turkey because this game is such an RPG when I finished it people came up to me and they're like what did you think you know and I'm like they were like did it meet your did it exceed your expectations I was",

You're going to see in this quest me making dialogue choices influencing how that ends doing these different things but like this is the action RPG part of it right? Uh, this is Aloy of course you heard about her. Uh, we're on level seven in the game right now. Uh, there was a jump but we got to play it from the very beginning and then jump ahead uh going through hunting whether I'm hunting a turkey whether I'm hunting a a watcher like that uh real quick so when when it speeds up like that that's you you edited that it's not part of a 5 minute thing I'm going fast through it cuz I don't",
