            "text": "Greetings and salutations and welcome back to Colin Was Right. Lots of folks have tweeted at me, reached out in the YouTube comments, and even contacted me through more private channels in order to ask me if Colin Was Right would ever talk about things outside of video games. Some people seem to want me to talk about politics especially. Well, Colin Was Right was designed to be all about video games and that's not going to change at least any time soon, but that doesn't mean we can't inject a little politics here every now and then. This is one of those times because today I want to talk to you about why political and social issues belong in video games. Yes, even the political and social issues you don't agree with. It's funny because I was mauling this episode over and began writing notes for it, curious about how I could segue into the subject of politics and social issues in video games. It was around this time that a tweet was serendipitously sent out from a buddy of mine, Naughty Dog's Neil",

It was around this time that a tweet was serendipitously sent out from a buddy of mine, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, that lobbed the ball my way albeit completely inadvertently. A man named Kristoff Coen tweeted Druckmann with the following quote, The Last of Us is my favorite game of all time, please try to keep your personal politics out of part two, thank you very much, end quote, to which Druckmann answered quote, no can do. Writers work off their views of the world. For example, the ending of The Last of Us is very much inspired by my personal politics, end quote. And just like that, Druckmann, one of the industry's great writers and creative minds, set me up. See, I've always been deeply disturbed by a segment of Gamers no matter how big or small stating that creators should keep their politics out of games. Why the hell would you want that? What a completely **** drab gaming industry we'd have to deal with if we",

What a completely **** drab gaming industry we'd have to deal with if we couldn't see shades of game creators in their work even even when we don't agree, even when we don't see eye to eye, even when our viewpoints are challenged, even when a particular video game may not be aimed at us at all. If video games represent an art form and in my mind games are most certainly art then politics can be, will be, and should be infused into them. It's the idea that Games should remain vanilla, inoffensive, and surface level that hold the entire medium back and those that harp on about separating politics from games are basically asking for the art form to stagnate. There is no other interpretation. Video games shouldn't be made solely to affirm who you are or to treat with kid gloves or even to care how you feel.

It's worth noting that the word politics has a few definitions. Miriam Webster defines the word in many different ways, but there are two definitions in particular I want to focus on. I'm not necessarily talking about politics here only in the Republican/Democrat mold or having to necessarily do with the control of government or government initiatives. Instead, I'm using Miriam Webster's fourth and fifth definitions, quote, the political opinions or sympathies of a person, end quot and quote, the total complex of relations between people living in society, end quote. Literal politics are also important and also play a big role, but that's not the only thing we're talking about here. We're talking about something deeper, something shaded in Gray, something more human. Has the gaming industry become too politicized in these regards? Perhaps that's really in the eye of the beholder. My take",

Perhaps that's really in the eye of the beholder. My take as one of the industries very few prominent conservative voices and I use that word prominent Loosely is that there's massive group think amongst those that cover video games for a living, but certainly not amongst the many many millions of people around the world who play them who come from extremely diverse backgrounds from varing economic situations with different belief structures hailing from every corner of the globe. People who are essentially grownup babies for trying to scrub anything quote unquote offensive from video games, not to mention Society at large deserve much of the scorn that comes their way, but understand that when you ask those people in turn to remove their own viewpoints, politics and social stances from what they create you become exactly what you purport to hate you",

You become a bonafied hypocrite. Trust me, I was speaking out and writing about so-called political correctness and the scrubbing of games and ideas so as to not offend anyone long long before it was popular and cool to do so, but this is very much a two-way street. You can't have it both ways. That's why I got upset when 6 Days in Fallujah was abandoned because of its sensitive subject matter or fought on behalf of a game developer who was accused of sexism when he clearly just made an innocent mistake. So when I see folks attacking a game creator for making a simple product based on depression for instance, something I personally deal with, I wonder why people don't see the creation of a game like that as evidence of progress instead of regression. I don't know Zoe Quinn from a hole in the wall and I",

I don't know Zoe Quinn from a hole in the wall and I don't pretend to know what's in her heart or mind, but I do know this, whether her game is good or bad, I think it's pretty cool that she endeavored to make a game with something so personal at its core. I think that kind of creation should be applauded and celebrated, not derided. That game undoubtedly spoke to people and that's a good thing. It takes a social stand. That's why it matters. Likewise, when a game developer is striving to make a historically accurate game that in this case explores a portion of Eastern European Society of yore and he explains that's why his game is full of white people and lacks minority representation, I accept that too and think his creation should be judged based on his merits not based on the Optics of  1st century constantly offended safe space politics.

I believe that he's not trying to be bigoted or exclusionary. It goes both ways. It has to go both ways if you want to avoid the dangerous pitfalls of hypocrisy. It bums me out to imagine a world where games are scrubbed from the very important meanings and messages sometimes buried within them at times subtly and other times overtly whether we disagree with those messages or not. One of my favorite games of all time is the original Bioshock, an exceptional Adventure inside a Libertarian Society run completely a muck. To me, one of the major messages of the game is that a society like this simply isn't possible without edging into dystopia and that its highly held directives could backfire in scary and unexpected ways as a person with some deeply held libertarian beliefs specifically in the social realm you think",

Atlas Shrugged in particular helped shape my view of the world. Bioshock eviscerates Rand's work and her ideas and I absolutely love that it does that. It's fascinating, wellmade, and thought-provoking. It doesn't change how I feel about Ayn Rand or Ken Levine or anyone who worked on the game. I simply love that it exists and I love to have ideas I took as gospel challenge in such visceral ways. I like Ayn Rand and I like Bioshock go figure.

Another game that resonated with me in this way was Spec Ops: The Line, one of the most underrated, underplayed, and underappreciated games I have ever encountered likely due to its terrible name. The way Spec Ops plays with right and wrong with Choice with murky gray areas of morality with a riveting overtly political plot at its Center was fascinating. It touches on mental illness and the human cost of warfare and makes digital murder impactful. It's not every day I as an American play a game where I'm killing other Americans hearing them talk like I do scream out for help or Mercy in American English decked out in US military issue camouflage. It's not every day I have to make it weighty incredibly moral decisions like Spec Ops: The Line threw at me. I'm so glad a game like this exists to challenge our Convention of what Shooters are and what we do in Shooters. Suddenly I wasn't killing the other, I was killing my own people.

Druckmann's own game The Last of Us is highly charged with politics as well specifically on the social side when it comes to Ellie sexuality. What's brilliant about this is that if you don't play the Left Behind DLC that came out after the core campaign You' never know that Ellie is a lesbian. I think the way Druckmann delivered this story was brilliant because you became attached to Ellie before you knew much about her personal life and once that the finding piece of her was delivered it filled in more of who she was without altering the makeup of your relationship with her. I think this is intentional specifically because I think Naughty Dog knew that a small bigoted portion of the",

I think this is intentional specifically because I think Naughty Dog knew that a small bigoted portion of the game's fan base might have a problem with this by cleverly delivering this information in the order it was delivered however it normalized who Ellie was. I have no doubt there were people out there whose Minds were changed about homosexuality based on Ellie because that's the intrinsic power of video games, the stories they can tell and the messages they can deliver. It's the same way I feel about the ultra brilliant game Gone Home which seems like a horror game until it decidedly isn't a game that likely introduced some players to the first lesbian relationship they ever ever encountered in the real or digital world and who spoke about them not in Brash sexual terms or with dismissive hateful rhetoric but in terms of love and normaly Firewatch dealt with the emotional trauma of an ending",

Virginia dealt with deep feelings of dishonesty and betrayal all without one word said or written a narrative told through observation as opposed to reading or listening. These stories all came from the depths of their creator their games became weightier because the Creator shown through to the games they deliver to the world. Does every game need to have a social or political message of course not.

Infinite Warfare which I thought was one of  016's best games touches on themes of neocolonialism, jingoism, nativism, and xenophobia that simply enriched an already great game. It didn't hurt it at all. Infinite Warfare played like a dream, but it also had important texture. Let me get off my soap boox with one last message a reaffirmation of what I'm trying to say once and for all politics and social issues even the so-called dreaded social justice have a place in video games a prominent and essential place in fact if we're ever to get video games to the respected artistic Heights",

I say to game developers everywhere give me more of your perspectives your meaningful stories and your political and social views even if I disagree at the very least it all provides vital food for thought and helps evolve our beloved medium.
