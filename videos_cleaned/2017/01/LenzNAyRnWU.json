Before you say anything, yes, I know I did a Nintendo Switch-related episode of the show two weeks ago, and I was thinking about going in a different direction this week. I have a bunch of show ideas lined up, but it felt wrong to ignore what happened in Tokyo last week, so I found myself a bit flummoxed. But you gave me clarity, viewers. I went to Twitter to ask if I should talk about Switch again, and you overwhelmingly, resoundingly said yes. Those other ideas will see the light of day in the near future, but in the meantime, let's jump back in and talk about Nintendo and the Switch for the second time in three weeks. It's important we have this discussion, and it's important we have it now. Then I promise we can talk about something else. Where do I even begin? I'm not sure how to go about saying what I need to say about Nintendo and its new hybrid device, other than that I know there are millions of people around the world who feel the same way I",

I'm not sure how to go about saying what I need to say about Nintendo and its new hybrid device, other than that I know there are millions of people around the world who feel the same way I do. Wii U was such a fiery, blazing failure on virtually every front that one simply had to assume Nintendo would learn its lessons, lick its wounds, and come back ready to fight when and where it mattered most. But that didn't happen. My bullishness and optimism in what I thought would be a so-called new Nintendo, and my confidence that they'd absolutely nail the Switch reveal while teeing up the hardware's first year on the market, has completely dissipated. This isn't a new Nintendo, far from it. This is the same hard-headed, tone-deaf, out-of-touch, woefully inadequate Nintendo we've become all too accustomed to. And perhaps I and many others were foolish to think the industry titan would ever truly change. Trust me, I won't make the same mistake again. What's so sad is that it's not even the",

What's so sad is that it's not even the hardware itself that's the problem. The Wii U was practically a Fisher-Price Toy when it came to construction, and its user interface was horrific. Nintendo Switch, by most accounts, feels great to hold and play. The UI seems fluid, and as we all know, its play options are what make it so novel. For God's sake, it's not even region locked. Baby steps. I said they should sell it for $300. That's what they're going to do. I said its lack of power wasn't very important. It still isn't. I said an independent, vibrant, and thriving Nintendo was an essential cog in the industry. That's still as true now as it was three decades ago. It's just that last point that's most at stake after Nintendo's poor showing when it mattered most. Worse yet, the problems are almost certainly going to be compounded as time moves on, even",

Worse yet, the problems are almost certainly going to be compounded as time moves on, even as Nintendo makes interesting and smart moves elsewhere, like embracing smartphone gaming and leveraging its valuable IP in amusement parks and other merchandising opportunities. The closer you get to the console market, the worse Nintendo looks when it comes to their future prospects as a hardware manufacturer. In particular, it can be argued that they've never, ever looked worse, and that's really saying something. Things started going truly awry for Nintendo and the Switch almost immediately upon the opening of the conference, when it became perfectly clear that Nintendo didn't only have very many of its own games of any consequence ready to go, but that it has all but failed to attract meaningful third-party attention.

I tweeted out what was circulating as the Switch's launch library, a meager, port-driven list, but it's apparently become even more dire as of the time I'm writing this script. IGN reports that there are five games confirmed for Switch's launch. Five. Who knows what that list will look like between now and March 3rd, but needless to say, if Nintendo had a message to deliver here, they'd have already delivered it. Waiting for E3 isn't an excuse, or at least a good one. If they had a convincing hand, they'd have shown it. To be fair, one of the games Switch will have at launch is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which looks **** phenomenal. It really does. I can't wait to play it. If folks complain that Xbox One couldn't run Ryse at 1080p in 2013, they're certainly going to light up Switch's reported inability to play Zelda at 1080p in 2017. That's irrelevant to me, but how",

And secondly, and perhaps most importantly, what the hell are gamers going to play when done with Zelda, assuming they buy a Switch for it? How many more people are Nintendo about to burn? And how is it that there are so many people out there who haven't learned their lesson yet, present company included? How can anyone defend this ****? What about this launch window lineup sounds exciting? Exactly. We're talking about port after port after port here. The sky of 5 was on PS4 nearly three years ago.

You simply can't shine this blatant turd no matter how hard you try. For context sake, it's worth noting that Nintendo has had weak launch lineups before and hasn't had a killer app available at launch only on its new console in more than two decades. In the summer of 1991, SNES came out with five games. Amongst them, one of the best games ever, Super Mario World, as well as cult favorites Pilotwings and F-Zero. N64's launched in 1996, which truly dire, with only two games available at launch, one of them being Mario 64. GameCube and GBA had far improved launch lineups, as did Wii, while 3DS's launch lineup was dismal and was part of the reason the handheld had such a hard time gaining traction. Wii U's launch lineup was admirable in number, giving players some options, even if nothing there hit particularly hard. People pointing at Xbox",

People pointing at Xbox One's and PS4's launch lineups and calling them soft or even bad, or even trying to compare the HD twins to Switch, are just wrong. By the way, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 launched with a new Call of Duty game, a new Battlefield game, a new Assassin's Creed game, a litany of current sports games, indies, other third-party games, some ports, and first-party games of varied varieties. Did PS3 and Xbox 360 have some of those games too? Sure. But all those games were all still new, weeks old at best, at launch. There were actual, tangible reasons to buy those consoles beyond one game and a promise of much more to come in the future.

Believe it or not, the missing component in all of this is Faith, as in the faith you have in Nintendo. Nintendo in 1996 could get away with releasing a console with two games, one of them turned into an instant classic, and we weren't far removed from Nintendo being fantastic. They hadn't burned us yet. 15 years later, 3DS showed a different story. Faith had waned mightily because Nintendo had ****ed up a myriad ways in the years leading up to 3DS, and it took early price cutting and a slew of software support to turn that ship around. Wii U was the final claxon Nintendo should have needed to hear to get the picture.

Let's ignore for a moment the fact that Nintendo opted to not bundle a game with the Switch itself, a massive error considering the increasing importance of spontaneous and set bundles from Sony and Microsoft, and considering that some of the most successful Nintendo hardware of all time, from NES and SNES right on down to the Wii, came with software that came to be essential to the hardware success and iconic in their own respective ways.

The dearth of third-party support on Nintendo is as clear as day. It's simply not coming. If it was, they'd have more to show than a splash screen of publishers and developers. And while this may not outright kill the Switch, it's going to stymie its success significantly. PlayStation 4 has installed nearly 55 million units in around three years because people want to play Sony's first-party games. Only third-party offerings from Destiny to Call of Duty to Overwatch and beyond guarantee its continued meteoric success. There simply isn't an example of a successful piece of gaming hardware that lacked third-party support. Not one. The canary in the coal mine was EA's inclusion in Nintendo's conference.

That's it, guys and gals. That was a very bad sign indeed. I get that Square Enix is showing some meaningful support with the likes of Dragon Quest XI and whatever the **** that Octopath Traveler game was. And I understand that Ubisoft is bringing old games to the console. And I get that some indies have hopped on board. But how can a gaming console survive in 2017 without EA, Activision, Ubisoft, and others supporting it in substantial ways?

Oh, and that version of FIFA for Switch, it's rumored to be a port of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 version of the game. Have fun with that. The takeaway here, when looking at cursory third-party support and the silence that otherwise permeates the nascent Switch ecosystem, is that publishers, like players, have been burned too many times. And even wildly profitable publishers like EA would rather offer cursory support than actual support. They'd rather risk nothing and make nothing than risking something to make something, because they obviously don't believe the latter is possible. Ubisoft bringing Rayman Legends to Switch, which came out in 2013, is all you need to know.

Then we come to peripheral pricing, which shows a Nintendo desperate to gouge consumers. There simply isn't another rational takeaway to be had here. It reminds me of the **** Sony pulled with PlayStation Vita memory cards and how much that turned people off. Well, you should certainly be turned off by a $70 ask for a Pro Controller, or 80 bucks for a Joy-Con set, or 90 bucks for a new dock. I'm not going to linger on this point for long, other than to say that these prices, among others, are **** absurd. This stuff is relevant to consumers, and it should be. When there are thriving consoles on the market at the price point Nintendo is charging for the Switch, and those consoles have cheaper peripherals, much more power, huge back catalogs, tons of upcoming games, vibrant online ecosystems, and more, you do have to do something to keep people around.

The icing on the cake is Switch's online functionality and all that does. It doesn't come along with that. Nintendo revealed that Switch's online play will ultimately be behind a paywall after a free introductory period. I have no problem with that in a vacuum. Providing online play isn't a free proposition for hardware manufacturers, as network upkeep can and does cost a small fortune. But there are pieces of the puzzle here that at first blush made Nintendo's online proposition laughable.

PlayStation Plus gives players six free games a month. Xbox Live Gold typically gives players four. And these are largely current-gen games to boot, games you have access to in perpetuity so long as you keep paying. The night and day comparisons between Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and this new Nintendo initiative start here, and they just don't end.

Nintendo Switch makes you use a separate device that wasn't even invented in 2002 in order to replicate the same functionality. That's not only sad, that's just **** embarrassing.

There are people out there who won't buy this console over this decision. Others yet will limit their playtime on Switch solely to first-party games. Either way, Nintendo loses. The sadness overall of this really hit me when I got home after the reveal. I sat on the couch catching up with what everyone was saying on Twitter, Facebook, and in various corners of the web, and what I was reading was overwhelmingly negative.

If the end of the Wii era, the Wii U, and the 3DS launch isn't going to make Nintendo change, nothing will. We might as well write it in stone. I actually randomly scored a pre-order for Switch on Amazon that night, mostly because I assumed none of my co-workers were still awake and figured one of them would want one. The only one of us that did acquired his own, leaving me with this pre-order I don't even want, but strangely feel guilty about shooting out of the airlock. Why should I buy this thing?

They haven't changed one iota, and they couldn't seem to care any less than they do right now. That will in turn force me to change, to look at Nintendo with even more skepticism than ever, and to never, ever put faith in a company that does nothing but let me down and many others time and time again. Could Nintendo Switch be great? Sure. Will it be? It's not looking too good for where I'm sitting. From my vantage point, it's looking like the Wii U all over again. Lucky us.
