Where did you find an arcade game? What dumpster was this in? I played this um during the the break and I forgot to to tell you guys about it um when I got back but it is it's called Killer Queen. Now it's a really random obscure game and it's one of it's a hipster thing where it's just just like you hear about it and it's like word of mouth and it just kind of spreads. This is an old game came out in 2013 and uh Kotaku covered a long time ago by no means am I breaking news of this thing but this shit's fun as hell and we need to play it.

Okay, so Killer Queen is a realtime strategy platform video game developed by Josh Debonis and Nikita Mcross, the world's only 10-player arcade strategy game. Two teams each led by a powerful Queen face off to be the first to bring the giant snail God home, fill their hive with nectar, or execute a triple assassination on the enemy Queen. So here's the thing in 2013 first started there in uh NYU these guys made this game and people started like falling in love with it just locally people there and they're like all right let's get this into a couple more places and now it's in 33 different locations um in America and it's kind of a word of Word of Mouth thing where it's just like people are traveling to go play this game.
