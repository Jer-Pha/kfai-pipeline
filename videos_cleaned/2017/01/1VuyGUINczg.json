Thank you for joining us. Why are you here? You just appeared. I am here for San Francisco Sketchfest. That is fantastic. I am recording a set for CSO for a show called The Guest List. It's a stand-up showcase show. Yeah. Fun. Yeah. Very cool. I saw some comedians last week. Who'd you see? They're part of the Sketchfest the guys we fucked. Yes yes I know those guys. They're awesome. They're very awesome. They're great. Have you I'm not going to say have you fucked them. No. Are you one of the guys that they have fucked in the past? I'm not one of those guys. Have you had sex? I have. I think. I've seen it a couple times. Yeah. Oh no. It's actually a lot more subtle than you think. Subtle? Yeah subtle.

And then they just feel warmth. And then they feel compassion. But it's like a consensual. Oh no they know it's happening. They just don't realize that they're falling in love until it's too late. Yeah yeah yeah. They don't know about the love. They know about the sex. They didn't know about it. They didn't realize that there was going to be such a wave of emotion that came along with his penis. Right. You know what I mean? I get it. That's great. That's a good quality to have.

But meanwhile I got food poisoning from ramen. What day did you get ramen? Friday. Okay. So I went out Wednesday night with our good friend Anthony Cava who we used to work with over at IGN. He's over at Wachina. It was Thursday. And I went out with him and woke up at Thursday.

One you sit on the toilet and open up the curtain to your bathtub so you can just be right here. Or you just get in the fucking shower. Yeah. You just get in the shower and just turn on the heat. And you just lay it out and just let it all dry. Just let it all come out. Yeah. Just like let that soothing hot water just get all the black blood out of you. Also great time for an audiobook. Yeah.

We probably got it from the same place because we got it at the same time. It's statistically improbable that you and I both ate at different restaurants in San Francisco and got food poisoning. The thing is like we didn't eat anything in the last 4 hours before that. Because earlier in the day me and Kev had Boudin. No was that Wednesday? It was Wednesday. No that was Tuesday wasn't that?

It just came out and started opening up its chest and it involved me and Tim and Greg. And Greg dealt with it better. Did Colin get sick? No I don't know. I don't think so.
