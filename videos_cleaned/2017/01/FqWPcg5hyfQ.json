Heroes is a complete re I was say you have third part is getting in there and filling a lot of gaps too where it's like well why does Sony need to go worry well I guess they're making open world game but you know what I mean like all right there's a million of them out there actually I do think it's interesting though because there's certain games that I I'm a little shocked we we're not seeing more direct uh competition to like Uncharted Tomb Raider and Microsoft's partnership for Rise of",
