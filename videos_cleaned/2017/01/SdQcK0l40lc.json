So I want to talk about the first year of the Nintendo Switch, or what we know of it so far, right? So I got to play all those games, they were great, they were cool, whatever. Zelda's the obvious dominant launch title, but there are other launch titles. Okay, I was going to say many, but that would be a lie. As of today, January 20th, we know of these launch titles: 1-2-Switch, which is not a pack-in, The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+, Just Dance 2017, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Skylanders Imaginators, and Super Bomberman R. What are your thoughts on this launch lineup? Launch day lineup seems shallow, you know what I mean? Uh, Zelda's going to be awesome. Bomberman",

Uh, Zelda's going to be awesome. Bomberman sounds awesome from everything you're saying, but right there, that's what I plan on picking up and playing on day one. Is Snipperclips isn't even a launch game? No, great, great. It's, it's March. Okay, so, so that's the thing. Moving, moving on a little bit here, games confirmed from March that don't have an actual date tied to them are Snipperclips, Fast RMX, I Am Setsuna, and Has-Been Heroes. Gotcha. I feel like Snipperclips should have made the, the launch date. I think it would have been, I feel like from what you're saying, that would sound like, of course it should have. Yes, like you have this eShop game, you have this thing that people think is cool, but you want to get it out there on launch day so everybody who's like, I want to play something and I'm hearing good things about this and it's only 14",

Yeah, um, yeah, it doesn't sound like a, a great launch lineup in terms of that, but I guess it, I saw, I think it was Ryan McCaffrey going back and forth on with people on Twitter about this of like, he's super excited about it and he's fine with the launch lineup as it is because he has Zelda and why would he want something to distract him from Zelda and stuff like that? It's not a bad argument, but it's also, and, and then because then I do think back to like my PlayStation 3 launch lineup, right? Where I bought a whole bunch of stuff, but I really just played Madden over and over again. Smuggler's Run, even Smuggler's Run, I'm trying to convince myself was great.",

Smuggler's Run, even Smuggler's Run, I'm trying to convince myself was great. Yeah, um, there, launch lineups are hard to nail. I feel like this, and I assume what Nintendo's doing here is something similar to what Adam Boyes talked about two years ago, right? With the two PSX ago, where he wants to have two or three announcements for everybody, right? I have two games on there that I'll buy on day one. Sure, okay, great. And that you need to try to apply that to everybody and give them something, but you don't want to overwhelm it and then have games get drowned out. Would I, I wouldn't buy Bomberman if there were three other games in there that I thought were awesome. Not to mention the fact that it's going to be just like my Wii, right? Where I get it and I'm like, okay, cool, Bomberman or whatever, I'll screw around with that and then I'm jumping right into Zelda and playing Zelda until",

Um, the, we're talking about the first year of the Switch here. The first year of the Switch sounds like it's going to be stumble out of the gates and it's going to be an uphill battle based on popular opinion and everything else that's happened with it, right? Like I went back and forth, I, I, I was, I got my pre-order on the, on the first night there off of Amazon and it was one of those like, I'm getting it and I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it and what, what I, I figure out why I'd want to keep this and what it means to me. And for me, a big thing is I want to play Zelda. I hate my Wii U. Uh, and a week later we go to Boston, so it's like, all right, cool, I have 12 hours on a plane, you know what I mean? I",

Uh, and a week later we go to Boston, so it's like, all right, cool, I have 12 hours on a plane, you know what I mean? I want to be playing Zelda. That I want to be able to go off into to The Wilds and do side quests and do all these different things. And even if we got it early, let's say through Nintendo or something like that, I'm sure it's going to, there's going to be plenty of side stuff for me to go do. Yeah, to go off and do something different on it. And so I was like, all right, there's that. And then in April, there's Mario Kart. And then in the holiday, there's Mario. And that's enough for me right there, let alone the little things that'll come along and do these different things. But I wish it was a no-brainer. It's always shitty to have, hey, there's this new console coming out and do, do we want it? Is it what it is?

What is the reasoning behind putting it out right now? Zelda. And but I mean, even we, the reason we've said that, I know, but I mean, is that for a fiscal year? Is it, I mean, is it because we just want to get it off shit or get off the pot with the Wii U version? I think I, I really think Zelda is the reason they're, they're putting it out. I don't think they can hold Zelda anymore. And I think that they, they realize that if they put Zelda out on Wii U and the Switch comes out in the fall, when it probably should have, that when the games were ready and that they had, you know, something to say. I mean, Zelda or Switch launching with Mario would have been way more compelling than Switch launching with Zelda for the, for the mass market. Um, and uh, Zelda games as we",

Um, and uh, Zelda games, as we talked about on, on the Morning Show last week, people have a mixed perception of how much these games sell. There's a few examples of them selling very well. Ocarina of Time sold very well. Uh, the original Zelda sold very well. Uh, but then you have examples of Zelda games sell like, you know, everyone was talking about Link Between Worlds, which sold fewer than three million copies. It's like the, you know, but if you would just listen to Nintendo fans or listen to Twitter or something like that, you think that that game sold 15 million copies, but it didn't, you know? And, and, um, so that's my major concern with Switch is that, I mean, I don't want to belabor what I said on Colin was right all already. You guys can watch that episode.

Um, it's just everything else, you know, like they, they just fucked up. What, what do I think of this launch lineup? I think this launch lineup is mediocre at best. And I think that anyone who says anything other than that it's mediocre is lying to themselves because it's, you have a great game in Zelda, but that's like saying the N64's two games at launch were great because you had Mario, but it was two games, you know? Like you have to have, you have to have a, a variety for people. Some people are going to play Zelda, they're going to be done with it in four or five days. Then what? That and that's, that's like, and then they're going to play 1-2-Switch. They can play I Am Setsuna. Like I, you know, and I'm a huge fan of I Am Setsuna.

They don't, they don't even know the answers to half the questions that are being asked. Where Netflix is even on it, which is weird. You can only take screenshots with it. You can't like, there's no trophy system. There's, you have to use online, you know, a lot of it's attached to a phone app. Like I'm like, what? Like the, the common theme I, I've gotten from people from the Switch is that some people are excited about it, some people are in the middle, some people are not excited about it. But a common theme is that if anything, that conference made people less excited. And that's, that's a, that's bad. Like if I never, I would have been like, yeah, day one, day one, day one.

And that's, that's a really big problem because I mean, and again, not to belabor the points because we all know what we thought about the conference, but there was so much in that conference that was like huge. Xenoblade Chronicles 3, that's speaking to Nintendo fans, like the hardest of hardcore Nintendo fans. Hardcore in a way, I'm not even hardcore. And it's like that gets, you know, muddled out by weird presentation and a weird focus of why we're supposed to like this console. Um, but yeah, for me, as, as somebody that you often talk about how, you know, Nintendo fans aren't buying Nintendo consoles for Nintendo games as a generality when you're looking at the numbers, right? I'm somebody that buys Nintendo consoles for Nintendo games. I love my Wii U to this day because it provided me with many great games, many great",

I love my Wii U to this day because it provided me with many great games, many great experiences that I hold up there, some of the best of all time. And I'm buying the Switch and I'm confident that I'm going to fucking love it based on how much I've played of it and also just what games I know are coming, let alone the ones I don't know are coming. And again, do I sound like a burned lover? Yeah, exactly. But those moments, those awesome moments of love that I get, I'm like, all right, cool, that's enough for me, especially because it's cheap enough overall as an investment where I'm like, $300, like, all right, cool, $300. Like with the Wii U, I've, I have not regretted the Wii U a single moment because of the five, at least five games that I love with it, let alone the fact that there was 15 that I love with it. But when I talk about perception, it's not necessarily talking from my lens because",

Like so when I use my N64 for, it's what I used my GameCube for, although GameCube had a good third party support and obviously we, uh, really died, uh, because Nintendo stopped supporting it, not because third party stopped supporting it, because people do want their Nintendo games. And I, and I acknowledge that and that's why I would want it. So I'm not talking about from my perspective, like I wish that they had Call of Duty on this thing so I can play Call of Duty on it because I wouldn't play Call of Duty on it anyway. What I'm talking about more is the mass market. Uh, the mass market doesn't give a flying shit about Xenoblade Chronicles. And, and for this thing to get, for this thing to go out there and win some people",

And that's my, that's my whole thing about, you know, if it's a console for me and you, that's great, but it shouldn't be a console just for me and you because it's going to fail. And that, and that's the, that's the thing I'm trying to, that's why like I'm like, people are like, well, the PS4 and the Xbox One launch lineups are bad too. I'm like, no, they really weren't. I don't know why everyone keeps saying that. They really weren't bad. They were actually, they didn't have anything, any standout that was better than the rest. It was a bunch of eights. But that's, that's, that's great though. When you, when you're launching and because people like, well, launch with some ports. I'm like, I guess, but it came with a Call of Duty.

Killzone. But the point is that they had not only volume, because I don't think volume necessarily matters. If volume mattered, then the 3DS launch would have been great. And the 3DS launch was fucking awful. The, the, and, and people asking, what's a worse launch than the launch lineup than Switch? I'm like, 3DS is, is the fucking worst launch lineup I've ever seen for a Nintendo product. But the, so it's not only about volume, but about choice. And it's about, hey, uh, dude on the couch that might not care about Mario, this machine also is for you. You know, it's like Killzone wasn't the reason that people bought a PS4.

Killzone was just an additive thing. People wanted PS4 because of the variety of games and the promise of games in the future. And when I look at this, I see, I'm with Greg where I'm like, yeah, Zelda looks great. I'm still, I have a Switch pre-order that I actually, I was actually writing an email to you when I saw your Facebook post about how you got it and went to bed.

I think it's going to be a great handheld. And I hope it sells as I said, selling twice as well as the Wii U is going to be a massive success. People are saying, saying like 50 million years. I'm like, yeah, no, no way. But 10-15 million units is doable. They just have to, they just have to nail this, this, this thing. And they have a perception problem. You can't sell a product to Nintendo fans. That's what the Wii U was. You can't do it. Like it's, it's not going to work.

And, and I know that people like, well, they have Splatoon. And they have, guys, Splatoon didn't move Wii Us and it's not going to move Switches. Xenoblade didn't move Wii U. It's not going to move Switches. Donkey Kong didn't move Wii U's. Not going to move Switches. We, you have to think differently. Zelda's, Zelda will move Switches and Mario will move Switches.

But to send it out to just be, and it shouldn't just be. I mean, talking about the first year, I feel like best case scenario, you can look at it like this. The launch here is going out to the beta testers. We are, if you're buying it like you and I are on day one, or Betty and tell Colin to, we're all beta testers and going through. We're going to stumble through the pain as they figure out this online system that's free until they want to start charging for it and all these different things.

And when they were like, all right, cool, we understand that we've been slacking. Here's why you get this. And you run a trailer that is Zelda, Kart, and the new Mario and Mario Odyssey. And hopefully two or three other things that are so we didn't expect that are there. Some, you know, whatever, Animal Crossing or third party awesome exclusives. Suddenly people are going to be like, fuck yeah, I want that for Christmas. It finally matters. And they'll get it and go. I don't think this is like, this isn't a, a death blow out of the gate.

And guess what? The hardware is fucking awesome, which is, you could never say about the Wii U. Never. And even me, I could never say that. I mean, the point you're making is interesting. What I do think is a death blow is the industry perception of this thing and the way that people are talking about Nintendo as a whole. And when you talk about the same old Nintendo, I think really the, the part I agree with most of that is how I, I, there's nobody that wants this thing to succeed more than me.

And it's like, now it's like, no, I do believe that Sony's going to have a killer E3 because they've proven they've had this track record recently. I'm just nailing it, nailing it, nailing it. And then the PS4 conference, which I like, in the grand scheme of things, doesn't even matter because when you look at it, E3 and PSX is what matters. Nintendo presentation mattered, mattered more than anything because this is them putting their best foot forward of, here's the new Nintendo and here's what we are.

I'd be excited for it, but I'm not looking forward to it as this thing that's going to answer all the questions and the, the way that I expected it to and needed it to for this to not just be, oh, Nintendo, you know? But it's like, having said that, I do think that there is a lot going for. And you talking about the beta tester thing, when 3DS came out, it had an abysmal launch lineup. And it came out in March, if I remember correctly. And it wasn't until probably January is the next year that it was like, oh, fuck, there's actually some games coming out for this thing. And then from then on, it was awesome. And they did a really good job of keeping up with the, the, they cut the price, which is why, which is why I think that I was so happy that Switch is going out to 300 because I think that they need to get themselves room to maneuver, room, which, you know, that sucks for the people buying it now, but also like,",

They called them Ambassadors. The, the, uh, yeah, I, I want, I really do feel in my heart that like a strong, vibrant hardware manufacturer, Nintendo, is essential. And when I saw out of them at that conference, what I'm seeing it now is I'm like, man, like I, I, I hope I'm wrong because I want, I want the Switch to succeed because I, I want Nintendo to do well. I think they need to, they need to show everyone that they're, they're capable of doing more. But I wouldn't be surprised to see for this to be it too, for not for the company, but for their hardware initiative in the next few years where it's just like, if people don't care about this thing, it is over for them as far as a hardware manufacturer.
