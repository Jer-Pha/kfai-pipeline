But the our trade deficit with Canada and Mexico increased 30 times since NAFTA passed. 30 times. Our trade deficit is higher 30 times over since NAFTA, since NAFTA was passed.

We're not talking about social networks or taxes, we're talking about specifically trade and free trade and protecting our our stuff. So this memorandum withdraws the United States from all Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations. So basically this was in the process of being ratified by countries and we are withdrawing and no longer ratifying it at all. Um, so the other countries will be able to be partners with each other if they want. They some sort of Free Trade Organization.

Um, I am for withdrawing from this, so I have no, I have no personal problem with this. This is above my pay grade. So yeah, it's very complicated. We're already trading with them. This just makes it we we trade with almost everyone. It's just a matter. So like people, so when you say tariff on imports, like when we other foreign goods, we can charge them a specific tax on that or right free trade at at the base level means that you can manufacture a trinket in Mexico and sell it here at for whatever you want with no border tax, right?

So adding a tariff, which would eliminate free trade, means that, uh, that the the idea of a tariff is to basically make it competitive on on the domestic level. So now that trinket in made in the United States and that trinket made in Mexico are worth the same amount, so you just buy American and destroy the Mexican, right? The Mexican industry.

Um, and and, uh, some people argue that it uses just as many resources, not like fossil fuel resources, to get it as it does to come out or whatever.

Natural gas is so cheap in the United States that it's actually people actually going at like North Dakota, which is a boom town basically or a boom state for for natural gas, is like dying now again because natural gas is so cheap that they can't even they don't need to get anymore.
