Well, VIII done. IX. And should they be considering doing something with her CG like Tarkin and exactly in Rogue Legacy? Yes, Rogue Legacy. Definitely. You know, Rogue One. I mean, spoilers.

Um, I didn't think it well, obviously the effect didn't work that well in Tron. I didn't see in I didn't see Tron. So who was who in Tron Legacy? They made Jeff Bridges younger. So his the villain was the younger version of him. It was it was a program, but it looked like him. Um, and so when Jeff Bridges came in, he had to fight himself, which I was like, that's cool. But it didn't really work. They couldn't. I guess they didn't get the right team on it or there there was a lot of criticism. It it was 008. Well, it was.

But by that point, there had been so many production delays that they lost the majority of the good guys. So they had to kind of I guess they got the B team on it. Anyway, it didn't work. And it didn't unfortunately, it didn't even need to be that. They could have just had someone that looks like Jeff Bridges be that character or a completely different actor be that character. And I think it probably would have been okay. See, I go a different direction. I I disagree. I don't think they could have just had a different actor. I think that they could have just Chang changed the plot so it didn't. That's what I meant. Right? I mean, obviously that he was supposed to be like a fact assembly of. I think that that's important.

What was a little more off-putting to me was the Jeff Bridges stuff and like the flashback scenes and all that. Because then when you see what's supposed to be Jeff Bridges' character in real life and he looks exactly the same as the computer villain version, that's when it was like a little bit weird to me. And I feel like they could have cut that stuff out. See, I just feel like you I feel like we're just in Uncanny Valley, right?

I mean, I I can't remember him in other movies after, you know, A New Hope for the most part. So you look at that and you're like, I guess that's sort of okay. But I mean, Carrie Fisher, everyone knows Carrie Fisher. I just saw her in a film, you know, that documentary just came out with her and her mother. I just don't know if people are going to be able to see that as real. And if it's not going to uh hinder the process or hinder the actual final. So to bring everybody up to speed, Episode VIII is done. They said her scenes are done. Her scenes are shot, done.

Okay, I'm talking about the end of Furious 7 specifically where they did the actual you think you go away without saying goodbye. Did you? I think it's a case-by-case situation where it comes down to is it about the actor or is it about the character? And I think that in the case of Fast and Furious, that was a sendoff of the character. But the reason they did the facial reconstruction stuff was to honor him, to honor Paul Walker and his you. So where does that leave us with Carrie though? Because she this is this is not to honor her. This is because ****, we have all movie to make. And I think that that's a totally different totally different scenario when it comes to Tarkin.

And be him seeing him as much as we did in Rogue One. I like I said in the review, thought unnecessary. They could have like kept it a little bit more Cy. But they obviously doubled down on it because they knew that this type of stuff was going to happen eventually. And they they need people to just get used to the the fact that these characters are they have story lines and those story lines are not going to change based on reality. But so so prior to this, right, one of the more more famous instances of this happening was Dumbledore dies. That actually played Dumbledore in the first two Harry Potter films uh pass away.

Okay, beyond that particular the point there is, I'm sure those people didn't realize that that character was in A New Hope. But how is that possible? I mean, I think it's casual Star Wars fans who don't understand the. My wife for instance, like, oh, I you know that I didn't know that guy wasn't real. But she but I looked at him. I don't know anything about technology as everyone knows, right? Don't care. Not really interested in it. I looked at Tarkin immediately. And maybe it's because I know Star Wars very intimately.

It isn't technically The Uncanny Valley for people out there that want to be nerdy. It's not at all. But uh 'cause that's like about how robots become so realistic that they actually just don't look real anymore. A term people use for no, I know. Similar to Occam's Razor, how we use that term where simplest explanation tends to be the right one. But it's not really what it means. The the thing about Leia that kind of bothered me. So with Tarkin, I agree with Tim where they should have they could have cast a normal person and just showed him from the back.

But it would have been cool. It's the same argument I made. I know it's redund to people where they should have never showed Luke at the end of VII. You know, like they should have just had that thing whirling around the guy in the hood because you know who it is or at least you think you know who it is.
