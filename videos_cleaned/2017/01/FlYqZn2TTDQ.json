      "text": "Greetings and salutations, Kinda Funny games Patreon supporters at the $15 level or higher. My name is K Moriarty. Uh, as you may know, we are now doing this AMA structuring as opposed to this live Q&A we used to do once a month on each of our Patreons. Um, Greg already explained it, but basically, in case you missed it, uh, the idea is that we used to do these live q&as for a half an hour. Very few people would show up. We didn't really find that they had much use or utility for people out there. We figured that this will be much more useful because if you support us at the $15 level or higher on Kinda Funny games, which we appreciate very much, you can leave a question and an AMA topic that will be posted every month on that Patreon and then we will come through an answer. Uh, by the looks of it here from what Greg posted, uh, very early in the month here on Kinda Funny games, there are, uh, 43 questions or so and we're going to get through all of them as quickly as possible, um, but still succinct.",

So I hope that makes all, uh, makes, uh, sense for you guys, um, and let's get right into it. Uh, Patrick Canon or Kanan, uh, asks, Col, what is one of your games that most people think is bad or mediocre at best? I think the the most logical answer to this, Patrick, is, uh, I enjoy, uh, very much Naughty Bear and a lot of people think that that game is bad and it is from a technical standpoint. It runs at poor frame rate, but I think the game design is cool. I think the idea is cool. I really do stand by the fact that I think that that game is a lot of fun. So that's always the answer that comes to mind for me. Uh, a pretty, uh, divisive and derided game that I",

Uh, a pretty, uh, divisive and derided game that I think is a great idea that I wish was better executed because it is a funny idea for people that don't know. Naughty Bear is basically about this Outcast teddy bear and a society of teddy bears that no one likes and he goes to like their birthday parties and their get togethers and and meticulously murders all of them. It's a really, really funny idea. Ryan Wood says if you had to name a pet after something video game related, what would it be? Uh, well, I had a pet, uh, a cat for 17 years named Chun Le. I got her in 1993. Um, she died in 2009 and her name was Chun Ley after Street Fighter. I have another idea for a pet that my girlfriend and I want to get.

Uh, Zack Bryce asks if the Nintendo switch fails and they just make games and no Hardware, do you think it's possible that they release only to Microsoft platforms because of the bad blood with Sony? I've often speculated on this. I do not think that that will happen considering the Bad Blood dating back to the Super Nintendo and the PlayStation add-on that ended up becoming a spin-off console is literally 25 years old at this point if not more. Um, so I don't necessarily think that that's going to happen. I don't think that makes smart business, uh, that's not a smart business decision for them.

Um, they'd also be sharking a fellow Japanese company, um, which is not necessarily unheard of, but, uh, might be bad for business since obviously in their home territory no one gives a flying **** about Xbox so that would be a bad decision for them to make. Uh, nonetheless, uh, I don't think Nintendo switch is going to fail. I just don't think it's going to sell very well and my my estimation is between 10 and 15 million units sold lifetime. I hope I'm wrong. I hope it takes off. I think it's a great piece of Hardware. I just, uh, think that they're making all the wrong decisions about it and I think you guys know all about that that check out Colin was right in case you didn't see that.

Uh, there's not necessarily a type of Star Wars game that I think would make the best kind of game. Uh, you know, I I am most excited I think about what Amy Hennig is doing. Um, basically making an Uncharted type third person narrative driven, uh, game in the Star Wars Universe. I think is awesome, but wouldn't it be cool to have all sorts of different games? I mean, we have Battlefront which is a shooter, a very, very fluid dice shooter. Uh, wouldn't it be cool to have a game like Kotor again, which was an awesome game that came out on Xbox back in 2003, an excellent game that's the reason I bought my original Xbox. Um, so there's all sorts of options there, but I think I'm looking towards Henning's game and visceral specifically as the kind of game that I think I'd probably want.

Uh, I think Nintendo is going to win this fight, um, simply because Zelda and Mario are coming out in the same year assuming, uh, that Mario does come out in the fall, which I think it will. Um, switch I I don't know that anyone's going to be able to beat that onew punch although I think, uh, Sony has a chance of having a great year as well. Horizon comes out very soon as I'm recording this. Greg is down, uh, at Sony Santa Monica in, uh, in the LA area playing the game with the guys from Guerilla, uh, for a few hours and he'll come back and hopefully have some interesting and pro hopefully positive things to say about it and depending on you know, Gran Turismo is going to come out which is a powerful onew punch with Horizon and Gran Turismo.
