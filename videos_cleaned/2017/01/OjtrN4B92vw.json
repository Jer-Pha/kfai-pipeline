Now this topic's piggybacking off of a Jim Sterling video, the latest episode of The Jimquisition that went up, Big Empty Sandboxes. Colin watched it, thought it was an interesting thing to discuss. I watched it as well. Did you? I watched it. We all watched it. Cool. You should watch it. Very, very informative video. I thought he did a really good job with it. Video like what, 7 minutes long? Something like that. 13 minutes. Minutes. We'll wait. We'll wait 13 minutes for you. I was say, there's never been a Jimquisition that's seven minutes long. I'm thinking of the L the Colin was right. Um, I wish I wish I could edit that long and make it a half an hour. His point was that there is a trend, and this trend's been going on a very long time, of every game needing to be open world, and it's this race to have bigger and bigger and bigger",

Really went in on Ubisoft because every Ubisoft game is Assassin's Creed in a different location at this point. Um, and I just kind of want to see what you guys think about this. I mean, it's a, it's not, it's a problem. It is a thing. It's, you know, he brings up a lot of great examples when he talks about it in terms of what is going on with open worlds and what's going on in there. I think it's painted with a broad brush a little bit. I think Watch Dogs, because the one that really strikes me that he brings up is side quests. He talks about the fact that remember when side quests were side quests, but they still storylines? Look at The Witcher. He's like, look at The Witcher. That's a real game with real side quests. And I think there's plenty of them. He",

He, you know, he brings up Infamous and how the original Infamous was all right, climb up this building, blow this shit off the side of it, and then get to the top. And you do that like 20 times. And it's one of the knocks I had against even inFamous Second Son or whatever. By the time you get there, at mashup of this awesome living, breathing open world, and then having to go to where there's a giant camera and an arrow pointed down. I think Watch Dogs 2 is a good example though. Their side quests were really good. Their side quests were, hey, there's characters and there's things here. It isn't just something to go do, but it is a problem and it is an interesting thing.

I'm like, I understand that, but it's like a network of television where I don't think most people watch every show on that network. They are in and choosing, so it's not as obvious. It isn't beating them over the head. It isn't driving them crazy like it might drive someone in our industry crazy of seeing Game of Thrones and The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead and Batman and Borderlands and all these different things. If you're just doing some of them, I think it's similar here where I, I play a lot of these open world games. I love open world games. I, I, I don't, I never wanted to be like, how big is the map?

It's, it's, it's, it's a good representation, boiled down video game version. Uh, I think it is part of that though, of the problem of stepping back and looking at the entire games industry, but not thinking as a consumer who is only investing in a few of those worlds. And I do, I mean, there is a huge point to it of just like, he brings up like, but when was the last time you had a side quest or a side story that really resonated with you and you remember it? And he's talking about like Elder Scrolls and Infamous and just doing these same things over and over. I'm like, that's a really great point of, I do remember there being games that I played where I did something on the side. I was like, man, that was powerful. I mean, Witcher is the",

But it is interesting and where does that fall? And but if the consu, you know, especially for giving Ubisoft so much in of the business in it, talking about the fact of like, they've openly said that that's what they're doing and this is where they're going. And they're doing that because Ubisoft is great at reading the tea leaves and saying, we're going to keep making Assassin's Creed until you stop buying Assassin's Creed. Oh, you guys are stop, you've stopped buying Assassin's Creed. We're going to give it a little bit of time and we'll come back.

Watch Dogs is critically well received, not, you know, selling like hot cakes or anything. Uh, and it's an interesting model for them to figure out. But I think there, that's part of it is that I think you can look at Ubisoft as open world churn. They're putting out so many different things, but I think they're putting out so many different things and not necessarily speaking to the same gamer every time. I played Far Cry Primal for a bit. I like, all right, cool, I'm done. I'm not mad that Far Cry Primal is open world and, you know, has a million different things going on and they're speaking another language and it is just go clear out this camp and take over this thing and do that thing. I'm like, all right, it's not for me. So I'm not mad that that's what that game is. But I'm super stoked that Wildlands is similar to that of going and take this guy",

I mean, Grand Theft Auto 3 is kind of the, the originator of this in terms of that's what people would give credit for creating the whole sandbox genre, right? And that was such an amazing experience. And then immediately everyone started copying that. And I remember Need for Speed Underground one, I loved it. Then Need for Speed Underground 2 came out and it's like open world and it's like, oh, you can go explore the city. You have to go get your missions places. And I was like, I don't like this. Like, I don't want to do this. Just like, I just want to get to the race. I don't want to have to drive to get to a race in a world super boring and not, not interesting at all.

And I think things have just kept doing that. I don't like open world games at all. It's because they're, they're way too big. The only one recently that I've really fell in love with was Metal Gear Solid 5. Yeah. And I feel like that did a good job of rewarding me. And even though I was doing the same thing over and over, it, it was, uh, a good loop of adding different challenges. And what I was doing was fun. You know, it's not just go to a tower and blow it up. It's like, there, it was always something about it. I'm like, I'm really invested in this, even if it wasn't for story reasons.

And I'm like, man, you did a great job. And it has so much that I'm like, feed the cat. This is weird and distracting from the what's supposed to be a story. You know, no, and I think you, I mean, you bring up a great point there. And I think it is, you know, that we have only ourselves to blame where we were all complacent as I think the word linear became a negative. You say, you say in a review, this game is linear.

Jim brings that up in his video, right? In the fact of like, linearity is fine if you're telling an awesome story. And I, I think he breaks up a great example of where he's like, you know, I've shit on the Elder Scrolls, but how many times can actually, I'm sorry, I praised Elder Scrolls, but to get bring it down, like, it's always weird that it's the end of the world, everything's about to end, but I'll go do this weird side quest and find these chickens or do whatever the hell it is.

And it wasn't the shit of like, all right, well, I'll drive over there and see what's happening. Yeah, it's, it's weird like filler. And I, I think that Grand Theft Auto actually did a really good job. I forgot which one they added this in, but when they added the, the taxi cab so that you can kind of like fast travel, fast travel. It's like, this is genius. You're cutting out the shit.

Sure. And that's, and this is walking a fine line, but I know the best friends follow me on everything. Not talking about Yakuza 0, talking about the Yakuza I reviewed for IGN, you know, three and four and that zombie one or whatever it was. That was always my the thing about it where you'd watch a trailer for Yakuza and it would make such a big deal out of baseball and hostess clubs and all this different stuff.

It wasn't like, here's why you should be doing this unless you're trying to be a completionist and get all the trophies or do whatever. And so you could just run through those games and never even know that existed, which I always was super weird of like, well, why even bother putting it in there? Why have me wander around? Why not just jump me to the next thing? I mean, I think a lot of that goes back to the, the early Grand Theft Auto 3 world games because they, they had that sense of like, it, it wasn't what can I do? It's what can't I do?

You could just go do sweet jumps and like, however you wanted to play the game, that was the fun of it. But then as we kind of like the novelty of that wore off, it was like, all right, well, you know, now we're just going to have a million collectibles. He even brings up in his video about the hidden packages in Grand Theft Auto. Like, those are great. We don't need, and he showed the map of like some Assassin's Creed. So much shit. I'm like, holy crap. Like, it looked, I thought it was a joke. I thought that was like a fake image he made. I'm like, oh, damn, this is real. Yeah.

And then as the further Assassin's Creed went on, I didn't need to go get every feather. And I didn't in, I didn't need to chase down the pirate shanties or whatever in Assassin's Creed Black Flag. But then Watch Dogs came around and I was like, I enjoy this gameplay in this world so much that yeah, I want to do all that. I think it is that argument of you can ignore that if you want and not have to exist in that longer and not have to do it.

And I think that back when with Grand Theft Auto, that was like, oh, this is New York. And it was still like a Disneyland version of New York. And I feel like as games got bigger and bigger, it's like, if you're not invested in the world that you're in, then you just, you don't care. I think Metal Gear Solid 5 is an example of that where I'm like, all right, cool. I'm just in the desert. I can't tell this from that. Like, it is just a desert, you know. Uh, but then playing Watch Dogs, it's like, there is that sense of familiarity to where I'm like, oh, man, I'm interested in this.

But, uh, it's when you're playing the, these games that are in like fake worlds or whatever, they need to really be fleshed out worlds that matter to you or else why would you care? You know, and I think that, uh, like GTA V playing through like going through San Andreas, it's like on spying just like how detailed everything is and how much is going on. And it's a little daunting too where it's like, I don't want to do all this stuff. I don't got time. But you didn't have to. I know, know. And that's the beauty of video games.

I mean, these are open world games, um, just from another era. And what I wonder about like Grand Theft Auto 3 being, and I agree with you, was really the one 001 when everyone was like, this is what we want to do. But I still felt like there was a restraint shown there. I don't feel like, I don't, I, there were a lot of open world games on PS2, but they were not to the extent where I feel like maybe it's because the middle ground has eroded or whatever. But that I didn't seem like everywhere you look, there was an open world game. Like everywhere. I mean, maybe I'm just misremembering that the PS2 era. But I don't think so.

But I feel like we've gotten, it's like through the looking glass now where the, the amount of open worlds in gaming today really does remind you that video, the video game industry is a business. And that these people, the bean counters and, and the heads of these publishers and the heads of the developers are looking at these games and seeing that are doing really well. And I was saying like, well, we can do something like this too. And I actually think it really started with Grand Theft Auto 4. And I really think it started with Fallout 3. I think those were the two games where, and maybe even Oblivion, you might even say Oblivion and, and Grand Theft Auto 4 in that order. And, and at that point, when you, when you make an",

And so, yeah, Fallout 3 comes out 2008. Your game enters production 2009. You're looking at 2013, maybe when your game comes out 2014. It's a reaction to a, to a trend in gaming that then has kind of just fed itself. And I have no problem with open worlds. I think open worlds are interesting and they can be fun and they can be dynamic. But I do have a problem with, um, open worlds for the sake of being open world. And I have a problem with, we often talk about The Order: 1886 as a game. We criticize a game, very linear game, but we criticize it rightfully so in the fact that I think Ready at Dawn focused too much on the engine so that when it was time to make the game, they really didn't make a game.

They had a very beautiful, high fidelity engine with a five-hour campaign that was like really a throwaway kind of thing. And I'm starting to feel that way with the open worlds that I'm encountering too. A great example of that is Mafia III. Mafia III is a massive, interesting world that is empty and devoid of any reason for you to explore it because spent so much time clearly making the world that they did not spend any time populating it. And I saw was Patrick Klepek or Jason Schreier, one of those guys saying like, this was a game that needed a year more time because they just, there's nothing here to do. And so I played Mafia III extensively for like almost 30 hours. And I, I couldn't play anymore. I'm like, this is so redundant and fucking boring. You know, it's just boring.

If there's one, if there's one word for that, that that game, it's boring. And what I've really become interested in in years past, really since PS4 launched, is the idea of partitioned open worlds. And what I mean by that is, um, the, the one that comes to mind originally, and I know this game isn't popular with a lot of people, but I really liked it a lot was Killzone Shadow Fall. Um, which is a PS4 launch game, a shooter. Killzone used to be a very gray and drab, quar, or type brown shooter. And I, I, I thought Killzone was wildly overrated on PS3 and, and, and on PS2. I think the fucking one PS2 is terrible. Uh, but the Killzone Shadow Fall and Mercenary 2 in its own way on Vita, they explored different ideas, not only different color palettes that made the game more visually appealing, but the idea that this game takes place in a certain order and it's bringing on a",

The map isn't as wide open as something in Fallout, but you can do things in different ways and there's a little bit of a way to explore. I'm, I'm brought to that forest level in the beginning of Killzone Shadow Fall where it's like, there's like four or five different things on this map. You can do whatever you want. You have a little bit of space. It's probably a couple miles maybe in the game. It's not this massive thing. They're not trying to get you lost. They're trying to tell you like, you have a little bit of a choice here. It reminds me a little bit about Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 as Primal's, uh, fortresses where you're trying to like kind of get in them. You can kind of approach them in different ways.
