Yeah, that it was like so audible. It was a good yeah. Greg Greg uh Nick, you want to give any uh any input on this? **** told me come come talk. You told me when we were in our initial discussions to have you come work for this fine company that I would have exclusive access to that ass. In fact, I remember it because I have an email where you spelled it dat ass. Oh, D-A-T. You can prove ass. It may not have been you, it may have been something that I completely wrote to myself.

I don't know if they still do that and I've never seen Hunter do it, but they do do that. I'm on some level, I'm sure that someone somewhere still gives the good game. I'm just saying you had a good game today. You got two pats on the ass, one from me and one from Greg. Okay, I I actually got four from Greg today. Wow, that seems excessive. It's a great game. Having said that, you may have a lawsuit on your hands. There you go.

Like when I trace everything back, all the different moves that had to happen, it's really bizarre. Like, you know, um I think when I was younger, I always wanted to do art. I was always into like the making of documentaries on HBO. And when everybody graduated from **** from elementary to middle school, you know, you had that little ceremony. Oh yeah, had the fun little thing. They played Rocky theme song and every did the hand thing.

That was like make the big **** T-Rex move in Jurassic Park. That **** was tight. That shit's **** tight. I want to do that. Yeah, um but uh yeah, so I was drawn all my whole life, super into art, creating like I was making games, but not like actual designing them. I meant like I would draw characters and rip off like Zelda and Mega Man and **** like that. But they were my games, you know, it wasn't The Legend of Zelda. Who were your Mega Man bosses?

So yeah, those like stupid **** like that that I was doing in ele and and like getting into middle school. Um and I just always had a special place in my heart for video games. Like it was always my brother and I playing on the weekends and my parents like hiding the console during the week so we couldn't play it, you know, even though it was on the third row, third, everyone knows the closet.

That's really smart. It's really smart, Tim. So speaking of video games, where did you start? Um I I it started somewhere in the NES era. I don't remember exactly where. When were you born? '88. 1988. So NES has been out years at this point. Mhm. SNES comes out in '90, '91. Some of I think '90. Yeah, yeah. So so for you, your old older brother. Yeah, okay. So that's where where the NES he was born. He was born in '86. So we had an NES and I have like those memories that are like barely there that I can kind of picture myself like playing that H some **** racing game where you're racing around a track on NES.

God damn, what a game that is. I to this day, best single game cartridge in existence. Like, and even disc and any of that stuff. Like any officially put out game. Wasn't it just a gray cartridge? But what I'm saying is, uh for what it had in it. Oh, sure. Yeah, okay. All the Mario games, especially the one I had was Mario All-Stars + World. So it also included World. I'm like, you don't get better than that. There's been like Namco Museum Collections and Sega Genesis Collections. Like, no, no, no, no, but you ain't Mario All-Stars, bro.

Maximum Cortez, Maximum Carnage. Yeah, I **** love that. That's one of my favorite like SNES games for sure. Um so yeah, gaming back in the day was um Mario, of course.

We had uh what was it called, Kevin? Ultimate Video. Ultimate sh shout out to Ultimate Video. That place it also had one of those like two-layer situations going. That should have been the name for Kinda Funny. I I know you guys said quality internet, quality internet videos would have been fantastic, but not Ultimate Video. Fun story. Yeah, I legitimately called the city about the building that Ultimate Video is used to be cuz it's been abandoned for years. It became a sofa place for like three years that failed.

Close to my house. Yeah, I wait, I think we were driving by and I was like, that place over there one day wanted it. One no, it was a special place though, because there was the Blockbusters, right? Yeah, those are always **** dope. Blockbusters going to be a topic on sorry, just to close that out.

But Ultimate Video for me was really like where the video games were at. Because by the time that I was renting games, it was Super Nintendo through and through coming up on N64 time, right? Cuz I was born in '89. So I the first system I played a lot of was the NES. Like my dad had a um Commodore 64, but like, you know, whatever that's bleeps and bloops. Uh but Kevin, his family had an NES. So I played a lot over there. My first system was Super Nintendo. So I started renting a lot of those games.

Okay, they they were they were around, but they like Blockbusters were on like every district had a Blockbuster. Yeah, I guess we had a Hollywood Video within walking distance. So that was like we'd go to Hollywood all the **** time. Um after after it was built, it was built a little bit later. I'd say towards the end of elementary where Freeze Frame and the other spots were like there since before I was born probably. Uh yeah, not really renting a whole lot of NES games.

How long have you been playing this for? He was like, I don't know, however, like a month or whatever, 17 years. And I just like, I didn't get into turn-based until Pok\u00e9mon. I mean, that that makes sense. I mean, honestly, I didn't get into Final Fantasy till after Pok\u00e9mon cuz I was a young. There are games that I remember though,",
