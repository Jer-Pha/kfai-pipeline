Do we get your ticket now? Boy, this episode of Gamescast brought to you by MVMT Watches. They're found on the belief that style shouldn't break the bank. The watchmakers' goal is to change the way the consumers think about fashion by offering high-quality minimalist products at revolutionary prices. MVMT Watches started just 95 dollars. At a department store, you're looking at four hundred to five hundred bucks, but they figured out a way to just cut out the middleman and make everything way cheaper, providing the best possible price, which on classic design, quality construction, and that style minimalism everyone's always talking about. You can probably stop being late to that thing that you're always late to, and hey, you might as well look good doing it. Get 50% off today with free shipping and free returns.",

Yeah, they just, I don't think I've ever seen a product blow up overnight, go this viral out of like, from 0 to 60, and there's people buying a thing. Yeah, you know, I'm seeing every, every single goddamn picture on the Internet. Turns out 2017 is the year of everyone becoming anxious. Yeah, your center line. Yeah, as I said, I saw Andy pick your walk over, and he had one, even shown it to me. All right, that was actually a magic trick. Oh, my wallet and Prada, like, why replaying is. Yeah, I hit you up about this yesterday, 'cause what happened is I, I don't know your guys' stance on it, and what your history is with it.

Like, I could play it on Vita. I saw them, I got the Platinum in that. I could go chip away at that. But is this one better? And but then it was just whole thing of like, well, what about replaying games in general? And not even Minecraft, as granted, every world can be a different experience. But what about like, I'm like, I can't wait for Super Mario World whenever they get that on the eShop for Switch. Like, I've played that a million times. I've bought it many times. I think every time I buy it, I probably play less and less. I just like having it. And it's the same thing like PaRappa the Rapper is here, and LocoRoco goes out this week. And what that means, Patapon, I'd be copping, which is different story, because we'll play the shit out of Patapon.",

The problem, but I want to know, like, I even made a joke on the old shows, you know, old game is old, or I don't want to play the game that I played before. I don't know how you guys do it. Well, especially this year, it's almost, it's, I feel bad if I'm replaying something. I feel bad 'cause I'm like, I still haven't gotten to Nioh. Yeah, I still haven't gotten Nier. With your two games, like, right at the hop there that I need to play. I want Nioh and Nier. Um, and we're about to get into like, I need to play more of Prey. I'm going to fuck around with Injustice for a little bit. And then all of a sudden, we blink and it's fall. Yeah.

I was like, how did you not accidentally create any time to hear any different dialogues, to do something bad, say, hey, you know, your favorite game of all time, you played twenty-nine times. One time, you can play it a little bit different than an extra. Fuck it. Yeah, when the Journey wanders naked this time. Oh, yeah, yeah, the rigor mortis. Yeah. Um, and so like, in my mind, especially longer games, I don't really play. That being said, there are probably ten games I replay on a yearly basis. Really? Journey is probably the most recent one. Okay. Uh, but a lot of mostly Super Nintendo games. You mentioned Mario World. It's Mario World, A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, EarthBound, Chrono Trigger. Like, these are games I go back to literally annually. Really? Um, and then why? What?",

I don't think, I don't, I feel like I don't say games peaked there, but my personal taste in games not just peaked there. Like, I, I don't think there will ever be a better Mario, Zelda, or Metroid game than those three. As much as I love Breath of the Wild, she gets like a genre-defying game. Um, so I go back to there. It's comfort food. It's knowing exactly what to do. I go back and play Banjo-Kazooie because it is, it's muscle memory. Like, we played through all of Banjo-Kazooie a year and a half ago on Christmas. It was me, Andrew, and Alana, and we played through the entire thing and got 100% and didn't need a guide.

Look, if I start dating someone, it's like, I want to show them P.T. or I want to show them Catherine or The Walking Dead. But other than that, like, I'm never going to go back and replay a 100-hour RPG. That's the thing when like, you know, one with the trophy will pop for like, whatever weird Japanese RPG game it is, like, played three times per season, the hour, the whole, the other week. Yeah, well, yeah, so Adam, fuck Persona. Yeah, yeah, I can't find, yeah, exactly. I can't carve out any time. I get to act like our 30th out there playing it twice. Yeah, that's the thing. I'm with you on it. It's just like, it's so hard to sit there and be like, I feel guilty playing more Persona because I feel like I'm missing so much now that the wheel was starting to turn.",

Like, Nioh was never for me, but Nier, Nier, since we did as a Square stuff, and I saw that for the first time, really, I was like, Nier, fuck that game was, haha, yeah. And now I get to fight the Square Enix CEO. But yeah, here's that game this year, everyone, most, so many people are sleeping on, like, not on purpose, but just on the fact that Horizon and Zelda and Mass Effect came out in that right in there. But it's also of that quality, though. That's what everyone is saying. I want so many people I trust online are like, Patrick Klepek wrote so much about Nier. Yeah, like, this is a fucking game of the year material, and this is so insane. I need to play. I love Nier. Yeah, I'm all about it. But I also don't play super long games. Begin wins.

I had a great time doing that, but I don't think I'll ever replay Breath of the Wild, you know? Like, that's, yeah, yes, experience that I need to go. They added New Game+. Oh, right in the update. Yeah, hard mode, native hard mode. Mode, get her a New Game+. You can continue playing. Okay, I have to be different because I technically your save point before Ganon. You can't save Dr. Ganon. Fuck. Yeah. Oh, well, against the boss, you know, video. Yeah. But I'm when you were annually, I'll play through a whole bunch of games. Most of the Marios, like the old ones, one, two, three, World.

No, I'd recently replayed that. Am I going to do this again? Yes, I am. Yeah, I totally am. And I most the time I replay a Pok\u00e9mon, it's on an emulator of some sort. Like, I remember for a long time with my PSP, I had a Game Boy emulator. Yeah, I could use turbo mode, so just it would speed things out. Yeah, because the old Pok\u00e9mon games are real. Oh, yeah, well, but I think at the beginning that that fat that'll fetch out at PSU ID Mr. Mason misstep pika - I missed at Sonic Miss fatwa Luigi. Oh, yeah, I don't think I ever exhibit.

That's really funny you say the first half because I could encyclopedically 100% the first probably six worlds in Mario 64. But if I got to like that, there's one where you have to raise and lower the water. I probably, I haven't played this on that luck. Yeah, definitely. I remember this one. I'm this best thing is like, 'cause yeah, it gets progressively, the levels get less and less interested in Mario 64. But that's story Kennelly on. But I think the games besides that, that because those are kind of just played through them, the games I go back to play the most are things that don't really have story or narrative at all.

And I remember playing freshman year college, she's playing it over and over and over again, getting everything. And then getting furious when my years later, my other college roommate borrowed it and came back with a different memory card in it. Fuck. Where's that? Never started.

But that one was like, there's this moment where Poe called me back in when he was finally playing it. And it was like, I'd already done the whole planning of it. And I was in a friend's room, and I walked him through. I'm like, wait, what difficulty playing on? He's like, I'm sorry, there's gonna be two more guards. I left off. They're gonna be here in the gym here and da da da. And I hang up. And the one guy was like, what's wrong? Yeah, how do you know? And I'm like, I want to see it all. Yeah.

If it is, games are so easy because it's like the digital, everything is made everything so easy to get more users. Games are cheaper. You can download free games on your phone. Yeah, dollar game.

Yeah, they need to fix that shit, dude. I mean, I guess the thing for me is just the fact of like, I don't know, I want to replay games, and I just can't because I feel like for me, games are my main source of entertainment. In the same way, I don't like rewatching movies because I know what's going to happen. You don't like rewatching? No, I used to as a kid watching rewatching. It's like, now it's fun to go back.
