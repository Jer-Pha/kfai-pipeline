Look, you can't have perfection without a little imperfection, if you know what I'm talking about. Can't it sweet without sour? Exactly. Yeah, it wouldn't be a Sour Patch Kid if after the sour you didn't get to the sweetness. I'll tell you what, now we have been Juiced. We have been racked up. We've been ready to go. I am Juiced. I have been miserable lately. I hate all of you, but today I am ready to go. Ter, I, well, a few reasons, Kevin. Now I know Kevin, wait, hold on. Would we like stopping right now and playing Mario Kart make you feel better? Because we could do that. We have that sort of technology. Kevin, are you kidding me? You got that kind of technology? Why you, you still like playing things and why can't I do? I, I can't, I can't play Mario Kart when a seven minute poop right now. Everything exploded a second ago. Yeah, oh my God, it sucked.",

Everything was fine. Now you know the chat's just going to say, 'Buy another streaming computer. Buy a computer to stream too.' Would that solve the problem? I don't know, man. We have, you know, we maybe, who knows. Here's my thing, what I need is a Geek Squad for Twitch. I need to be able to hit up Twitch and say, 'Hey, come over here and tell us what's wrong with our setup.' Yeah, make our setup better. Yeah, instead you just got a bunch of people in the chat who are Monday morning quarterbacking over there. They're, they're going to probably respond to you the same way they respond to everyone.

Restarted the computer. It said it had to fix and scan something. I was like, 'All right.' Then it connected. So that was the issue. Nobody cares anymore. That's good. It's done. We're alive. It's working. We're not going to get mad about it. Nobody's mad about it. All right. Instead, I'm going to talk about why I'm Juiced up today. I don't know. I think it's because I woke up naturally today at 6:00 in the morning, 5:55 to be safe. I like this. There you go. Went back. You woke up at 5:55 in the morning? Yeah. What happened?

Got out here, right? Did a whole bunch of work. Made a good video that we're going to get up later. Had a couple of good calls. Kinda Funny Live shaping up nicely. Fantastic. Then I got to come out here. Debut, Kevin. Now what I was going to say before is, I know you've had a rough morning. I'm not going to judge you if the answer is no. Does my one work correctly? Thank you. Uh, I was very excited, very excited to debut my new coffee mug. It's me and my father. I'm going to come back, face. That's what I got to do. See, look at that. That's awesome.

This is what he does. He's done this my entire life. But I, 'You're just not the son I wanted.' Exactly.

You, oh yeah, oh sure, sure, sure, sure. That was, I just watched that the other day. It was on TV. Did you really? Yeah, I, I walked into the room, my wife was watching it. I was like, 'Are you, is this just on?' Here's what I'll say. I'll say what everybody's thinking about Princess Bride. Overrated. One of the, no, not my phone. It's not overrated. It's beloved.

What about, I read William Goldman's book on screenwriting, which in which he goes into detail about, he wrote the actual book and then actually wrote the, when Rob Reiner approached him, uh, to get the license for it, which a lot of people had tried before. Um, they collaborated and then he ended up writing the screenplay for it as well. And they talk about, so Ro, and then I read Cary Elwes' book on, it's called As You Wish, which was his just, it was the, it's basically just about the production of that and how when he was very young, he got involved in it. Um, who is Cary Elwes? Is that the, he's Bradley, the guy? Yeah, he plays the Dread Pirate. Saw man from Saw. Yes, Saw man from Saw. Uh, knockoff Jim Carrey in Liar Liar. Yes, perfect example.

Um, Jo, but they talk about how, and, and maybe it's just blowing smoke up asses, but they genuinely, it genuinely comes off like it was one of the best experiences of their life making that film. And all of them in the other, in all the other books too, including William Goldman, who is, if you read anything about William, his work and his life, he's very much a curmudgeon. He's very much like, because he's had these doom and gloom, he's been a writer in Hollywood for like 50 years or something like that. And so he's had these horrible experiences and he goes, so he came in very guarded and was like blown away by how just everything kind of worked. If there was a problem, people solved it.

Even the cast members like Billy Crystal and, and Carol Kane, who came on later, just walked in and like, I guess just vied with everyone. Um, and then of course there's Cary Elwes tells a story about how he and Mandy Patinkin, um, that he, uh, 'My name is Inigo Montoya.' Got it there. Um, how they wanted very much, they collaborate, when, when they were talking to Rob Reiner, they very much wanted, uh, that sword fight to be the most epic sword fight anyone's ever recorded. And they went through all these references of all these old like Errol Flynn movies, things like that. And they trained like **** demons to be able to actually like sword fight. It was crazy. So every, he would say, he would go through and say, 'Every time I sat down for a second, the sword trainer would put a sword in his hand and go, 'Let's go!'

And the other like, you know, six to eight to whatever, however much time was film, was just go back to the thing and practice, practice, practice, practice. Uh, and they worked with these master swords people to do it. So, because they wanted it to be them. They didn't want it to, they want cut away stunt doubles. So obviously there were stunt doubles when he does like the flip and, and things like that. But predominantly what you see on the screen is them, which is pretty, which is pretty fascinating.

Wallace Shawn, of course, came to Greg Miller's purview, if you will, when he showed up on The Cosby Show, because Greg Miller knows The Cosby Show backwards and forwards. And I loved every time he showed up. Turn off as well. What can you turn off the **** fan? Is what he's asking you to do. Talking. I know. I'm just clarifying the fact that this is just ruining his day for a second. Doesn't care about anything I'm saying anymore. I love the fan. So Wallace Shawn shows up on The Cosby Show as what, Shawn? I think he's one of, one of B, Band of Rogues. He, he has that annoying voice, but it becomes the endearing voice, you know what I mean?

I was like, 'This is my buddy Mike, who is very self-deprecating and very much doesn't understand how talented he is.'

Um, but they talked about how he didn't understand, he didn't speak English very well. Yeah. And so Rob Reiner had to record all of his lines in the par, in sort of like the cadence of how he wanted to say them. And so Andre would walk around set with a Walkman all day listening and practicing that. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. And they said also that he, um, he couldn't walk very well at that time, at the time his health deteriorating. Um, so they had to get him like an ATV to like get up and down the hills when he had hilly scenes. Um, and of course he was like, he loved **** with Cary always. So he made him ride it.

And the first thing he did was he like gunned the thing and fell off and, and broke his leg, broke his foot. Jesus. So for, there are portions of that, of the movie where you can see him literally limping because he luckily he did it and I think he healed in time. He, they had either done the sword fight already or he healed in time to do that.

And Andre can drink like he would drink, yeah, **** bottles of liquor because he could just handle it. Sure. You know, that's crazy. Andre the Giant was cool. Was a bad ****.
