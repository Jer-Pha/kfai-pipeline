Yeah, what's your topic? Playboy. Who? Doctor. So um over last weekend I watched an Amazon Prime series called American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story. How is it? I see it all the time. I I watched that, you know, Good Girls Revolt or whatever, right? And I want to, but I saw this one, I didn't, I didn't jump. Um, it is a docudrama, so I thought it was going to be more of a documentary series. Um, but I, I don't know if you're familiar with the medium of docudrama, but um, it's not a documentary in that it's not a totally objective perspective. You can definitely tell that it was made by people in Playboy. Uh, it paints Playboy in",

Uh, it paints Playboy in a very positive light throughout the years, um, rightfully so. But then or some other, there's some points that, you know, for instance, during the 70s, where he's getting basically like Hugh Hefner is basically being torn apart by feminists because it was the women's movement. Um, and he, you know, they kind of gloss over that a little bit where it's like he, we're fine, Gloria Steinem starts in trouble. But anyways, then the 80s came around. Yeah, so, so it's more about sort of Hugh Hefner's life and how he was innovative and and recognized that there was a need for, or not a need, but an opportunity for that in the magazine world of the 50s and 60s of like a a men's magazine. Not not necessarily new, there was plenty of magazines were printing that, but he recognized like he was a big fan of Esquire, worked for",

I'm make the magazine that I want to read, which is about like what is the modern man in this day and age? What does he like? What kind of music does he listen to? What are his political beliefs? Um, you know, and and throughout the years formed this very progressive magazine that um, supported uh, civil rights, women's lib, things like that. Like all these tremendous like, you know, was against the outspoken against the War in Vietnam, which I didn't realize.

Cause I remember being a big deal if they were no longer going to be in nude magazine. And then I saw an article, I recently, I thought article that I saw in February. Um, nope, that's not it. Can't remember your password. Uh, in February, the 13th of February, uh, this is from Suzanne Brezing says, Playboy back to pedaling nudes just in time for Valentine's Day. Playboy has announced its 63-year-old magazine will return to publishing naked women.

Like, and I'm not saying that the writing is not good, but it's like, I don't like this thing where we need to come up with a excuse, an excuse. It's like, let's Playboy should exist as as whatever it needs to be, not with the, you know, it's, it's smut, but it's also that. It's like, all right, can it just be that? The problem was that the articles were really good. As you know, somebody with a degree in magazine journalism, like Playboy is one we talked about in class all the time that they really did have great articles. Egg, no, I know.

Um, so they really did have a journalistic integrity at least from from a writing perspective. Um, but obviously not enough for it to be successful. Like that's the thing is like that what, why not just make an Esquire then? Like why include the, because Esquire is a half step. I love, I, I subscribed to Esquire for a long time, loved Esquire, and I have nothing against it now. Like I hate it. But that, I mean, that was the whole thing of like Esquire and Maxim are just trying to be the more successful to because there are no nudes in it Playboy, right?

Where it's like Maxim, it, I mean, I liked in college a lot, I think most people did, right? I haven't read it in years, but I remember eventually getting to the point where you're like, I don't care what's happening at Spring Break with your beer bongs or whatever, you know what I mean? Like whatever the thing they're talking about. And then Esquire, yeah, being a bit too stuffy and having a, you know, like this is what we're doing.

I don't want to be buying a magazine that all nudity, somebody judging me or whatever. Yeah, I think that there's two sides of that because I did buy a couple Playboys. Most of the time with it, it was when it was like WWE, sure, or WWF, I guess back then, which was like, shout out to that, that was great. Um, when or Christy Hemme or whatever, they all, they all did their things. Uh, but I just, it's just ridiculous to me that like those can't just be separate products.

No, I mean, you're not wrong. I mean, because I did the thing where, oh, I was in an airport years ago. Well, I guess sometime between 2015 and February of 2017, when I saw a Playboy on the stands and it was right after they had done this. I was like, oh, I was in the airport. That's Playboy. There's no more nudes in it. Interesting. I picked it up and page through it. It was like a Maxim or Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, right? The way they were photographing these ladies. And I was like, huh. And I was like, always like the articles. I'm getting this. I'm like, no, but I don't want to read this on the plane. You know what I mean?

And but even then, like, to be fair about my argument about they're obviously going back because it's not selling well, I don't necessarily think this is going to solve their problems. They're going to sell well. The internet exists. You can see problem. This is just print in general. And and I do think Playboy has done a great job in the last couple years, especially with their digital digital division of highlighting people and uh, doing photo shoots and stuff that are the PG-13 stuff. Like things like they did with Naomi and like a lot of those people. And it's just kind of bringing attention to uh, I'd say up incomers, but they're they're more somebody that from a different medium than being a model.

I mean, because I never really had it in my house. I was never really um, I had a cop and a nurse for a mom, so cop for a dad, mom, a nurse for a mom. And so I never really had it there. And I always had more comic books and magazines of like gaming stuff and just learning about life and **** like that underneath my bed. Never really had like a Playboy. She tears it open, there's Incredible Hulk Comics. Like, what the hell? She anyways, it was just that idea. I guess maybe because I felt guilty if I ever had something or I caught.

Like, it's funny that I didn't even think about that fact that you probably study uh, Playboy in college. Um, didn't we all? Well, that, but that's the thing. Like my first, my first touchdown for Playboy, I think was like my buddy Todd's dad had like all of them in the garage. All of them. Like, I mean, all of them. Like he'd been collecting for years. And so you'd go into the garage and it would just be stacks of Playboys. And he, he'd always be like, don't take any of them all. No. And we took a, we took so many of them. He'd never **** knew. Of course, there's so many of them, right? But to me, to me, Playboy is a like a porn magazine, basically. Yeah, I didn't know it had articles. I didn't care.

I think that's that is so important to the formative years of so many people of different generations. I had the exact same experience with Kevin when we found his dad's stash, which was not every issue. It was a like three, three issues in the back of a file cabinet underneath a whole bunch of other ****. One day we just found it in the garage and we're like, holy ****.

Yeah, well, I mean, and that's the thing too. Like, like depending on what you choose to believe or if there there's a lot of rhetoric that goes into it, but Hefner's original concept was that he was, they, they, they touch on this a little bit where he had read um, Kinsey's book, um, the name of which is escaping now, but it's the famous book about sex and like, and how people, no, it's, it was actually featured Masters of Sex.

I'll look it up later. Um, but basically was the Kinsey Report, I think is was called. There was a movie by Liam Neeson, um, where basically Kinsey had interviewed like, I think it's thousands of people, talked to couples, single people, guys, talked about their masturbatory habits, how often they have sex, how often they fantasize about same-sex stuff, heterosexual, homosexual, all the stuff. And that that book came out, that report came out, and it was the first thing that Hefner saw. Like when he saw that, it was eye opening for him because he's like, holy ****, we are an incredibly uh, repressed society when it comes to sex. So why not put a magazine out there that that not only celebrates sex, but also celebrates it in terms of like what it means to be a modern man? Like, you know, this was years before the Sexual Revolution happened in the 70s, um, in 60s, 70s.",

As far as men were concerned, you didn't have a penis. You just worked hard and, you know, probably drank way too much. Um, and so I think it's, I grew up in the, you grew up, yeah, you, I mean, you grew up in the era with with a bunch with with parents that were hippies, right? Like they, they'd experienced that. And I think they were, I think all of us that as as our parents were probably a lot less, a lot more progressive than the generation that came before them. My my my mother and my father certainly, if you met any my grandparents, you'd be like, holy crap, these people could run to prison like with precision. Um, like never talk about it.

And and watching his steps and watching him follow his passion and seeing that pay off um, in dividends and in that social influence that he had is really, really cool. Um, but he like, I honestly believe that he followed his heart and follow what he believed in. And a lot of the times he would use Playboy as a uh, as sort of a loudspeaker to to to affect social change.

Um, and of course they go, they go into Penthouse and how Penthouse like, you know, escalated the war of like how much they'd show because up until Penthouse came on the scene, there was no, all they show were were breasts and and butts. There was nothing, you know, no no pubic region whatsoever. Um, but it's pretty fascinating. So what's your, I mean, you finished the series? I finished the series. It's really cool.

And that did not work. So now let's try to go back to what's worked before, which is them floundering and not knowing what they're doing. Um, fortunately, the series ends before they broach that topic. It ends with Hugh Hefner basically stepping down and handing over the um, the reigns to his oldest daughter, I believe. And now I believe Cooper, uh, he is the creative director, but I don't think she runs anymore. I think he runs it now. Okay. Um, but yeah, they don't, they don't broach that topic.

And so Playboy had a whole different meeting to maybe our father's generation. Um, or even our grandfather's generation who may have seen that when they were in their 40s and like realizing, holy ****, there's more out there to life than just like having sex once every six months to make a baby. Um, nine months, 10 months, nine months have the baby, 11 months. How many? What about elephants? Well, that what's cool though is the iconography of Playboy is so iconic, you know, like that logo, the bunny. Yeah, it means something. And it's crazy that I mean, it works in every way.

Yeah, that it's like that they they **** succeeded at taking something like sex, which is so ingrained in all of us and added to it. Yeah, you know, like when you think of sexual images, that bunny is in there. Gets you. And that's it.

Yeah, but I mean, I mean, but you mean important in a legacy sense? You think Playboy will be here forever? No, I don't. But I think that what Playboy did, Playboy will always be the default, default. Everyone, not everyone, of course, there's going to be a point of people don't know. But I do think that uh, in 100 years, people will make reference to Playboy for what it is, even if they've never seen one at all or known that.
