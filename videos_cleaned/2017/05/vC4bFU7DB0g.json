Did a great job. We did a whole bunch of crafts photos and then we wanted to interstitials of photos in places important to us. So first off, of course, was Wing Wings. When two Wing Wing Wing Wing is not open on Mondays, as you know. Yeah, not open on Tuesdays, but it does matter for the story. Not open on Mondays.

Showed my dad around, you know, number one crane operator Greg Miller had a bunch of questions about her in the business. Showing mom around, giving us all this free beer and stuff. We didn't get any money. I realized after the fact, I do gave everybody T-shirts. It also Christian's **** awesome. If you're gonna Kinda Funny Live 3, go in and see him. Not just because, as always, I've said Wing Wings is great, but they are family and they were amazing. The photos there are my favorite ones from the wedding. Just, they're so good, so us. You know, I know because that was our relax too, because we just came back from the wedding. Yeah, everything we've done, right? And that was the things I never thought about it.

We had, we poured Dales Pale Ale and the Los Gigantes into these like fine crystal engraved things my mom got us. And she was totally down in a red. Awesome. I love the the chicken wing sauce on the boobs. Yeah, that's possible. But there, you know, that's that's where we went on our third date. It's one of those like, obviously means so much to me, but that's something that I think means something Jen in our relationship in the fact that that I shared that so early with her, like what that place means to me.

That's not what's about, obviously.\" But I'm so excited. I want to express that. I'm expressed all my best friend.

I want to put something up today saying.\" And we did this, that we had this last moment.

I should have bought a laptop unless you have a computer.\" I'm like, \"I don't, but Wing Wings does. Oh my. Hey Christian, can we use a computer?\" \"Yeah, of course.\" You went back there and Sean popped out the card. It did and went through and showed us photos. We Pixel XL and he put them on his phone.

I have my parents here who are never together. I have my best friend here. I have her family here from Montreal. Like this is creating like everyone's talking to each other. Like to see my dad talk to Christian about what it's like to run away. I was like, \"Eh, what the? Swap your own little world, right?\" Yeah, yeah. This is never something I thought would be a thing, you know what I mean? Sean took amazing photos of that. And it was this awesome moment for us, for me, you know, new knowledge, different things.

They reserved the bar for us. They reserved our stools where we had our first date. So we got to sit at those stools and be with our, surrounded by our family. And they gave us, oh great, they were awesome. They made this awesome cocktails. I'm sure they like, as soon as we got there, a guy came up to me was like, \"Hey, congratulations. What, what?\" You know, I don't, \"Thanks so much.\" And then they like to Sean, like, \"You want to come behind the counter and take photos?\" Like, you know, all this different stuff that normally doesn't get to happen.

Um, the one thing I didn't ever plan out in my head thinking about how amazing this would be and like what a special moment this would be and what like literally once-in-a-lifetime moment this would be was that when we finished in Hard Water, we were gonna, we take about a Sean because it's not working to go home. He's just a, he's, you knock off, you know, enemies. I take photos of everything in the Water Bar's closing up or I turned everyone like, he's every down to walk. Like it's like a ten minute walk. It's not that bad down the Embarcadero. It's like getting close to sunset. It's a beautiful sunny day out. Super hot this week. It's been, you know what I mean?

And for a while I'd be behind her with Poe or my mom or whatever, then be with her or whatever. But V, it is now Embarcadero. If you're not from the San Francisco, like a touristy stretch along the bay, an amazing view of the Bay Bridge and all the stuff. And the cars that would slow down and honk and scream congratulations. The people that would stop and say hi and congratulations that keep going. It was like such an amazing moment, let alone to be walking behind Jen and see people. I do the double take and walk and stop like I like talk to each other, not to us even.

But yes, although the Converse peeking out here on the stairs, I think it's such a great idea. Watch. Yeah, yeah. And they they have those amazing pink mesh ones that kinda look like a dress fabric. It was great. Yeah. Oh yeah, with the Water Bar, had a lovely dinner. Mmm. Got a whole bunch of oysters, too many mushrooms. CD. Yeah, yeah. I had to talk Jen out of ever getting, and they were, had to talk Jen out of getting the giant seafood platter for herself. She went, got a petite one instead, which I didn't finish.

It sounded like to me, it's been happening since like November, right? So it's just like you kept talking about your plans. Yeah, it's like, yeah, so we're going to do this, then we resist, resist.

Sunday comes along and I text like, \"Congrats, you guys. I'm excited for you.\" Whatever. Totally thinking you're getting married on Sunday. And then on Monday, you start posting things.

We turned out pack boxes anyway. But it was just so funny because all like I was so off about the whole thing. And then that's done.

I feel, you know, my parents always saying that it's gonna go faster and faster and faster. And the thing especially with us, I find about how fast our life goes where you go, \"Remember that we do the podcasts where I was like, 'Well, remember in February this comes out?'\" You guys like, \"It's March.
