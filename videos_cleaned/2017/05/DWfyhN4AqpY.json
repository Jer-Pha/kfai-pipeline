I'm one of your host Greg Miller alongside the producer Seducer Nick Scarpino. Smell my coffee, cinnamon, right? Yeah, put a little sprig of that. I read an article yesterday, the news, one of the paleo, one of the, one of the 15 paleo newsletters that I, I subscribe to, and they were saying cinnamon good for your metabolism. Put a little sprig of it in your morning coffee, you know, mix it in with whatever you're eating, you know, apparently supposed to be good for you. I think you're, you might have to put it in like pair with protein, but I mean, I feel like just drinking coffee is good enough. So now wait, you went to Starbucks, yeah, and you said put some cinnamon in there, or did you bring your own sprig of cinnamon? No, they have little, they have nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon up with the little uh condiment cart where you put the, you stir in the, they also have like chocolate powder and",

And I remember being a little kid and being like, ah, **** yeah, I'm going to put chocolate powder. And I was like, this is different. I'm like, no, it's because it's cocoa powder, it's not chocolate. It just has, that's the thing I like about the cinnamon, has that, it just has that smell to it. Now, it doesn't really affect the taste too much of the coffee. And since I've screwed up my nose from years and years of smoking and sinuses, anyway, like allergies, doesn't really matter. I put anything in this **** coffee, it's still going to taste like coffee. Yeah, I mean, like, I'll put Red Bull in it. I like how somebody in the chat was like, oh no, Red Bull for Nick today.

Oh, and 50% of the vitamin B6 that I need as far as my pantothenic acid is concerned, 50%. So you'd be foolish not to drink a Red Bull is what you're, yeah, and it's got a lot of niacin. So I don't know if I need these things. I know vitamin B12 gives you energy and it's got a shitload of caffeine in it, which I could do without the caffeine, but I need the vitamin B12. Need it. You do need it. Everyone needs it. Um, you told a fun story there about putting cocoa powder in something, right? Yeah, here's one for you. Yeah, give it to me.

We're not going to do this anymore. Sorry to back up. I know. Sure. They own Eidos though, right? Square Enix owns Eidos. Yeah, they, well, so it'd be similar to in my, in my understanding of this, let's say IGN buys, and I know if this is official, if this is officially the right analogy. I, IGN, well, a better way would be Nintendo buys Sony. And so then they get all the first parties Sony's has as well.

Yeah, are you paying your staff? It's not like these deals are done overnight. Let's say this is the first time Sony's heard about it or whatever, even though they talk about it being a March 31st, you know, thing. Has anybody been moving on this? Is this a real thing now?
