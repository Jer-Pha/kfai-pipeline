And right now, you can double the berries for just $10 more. And guess what, Kevin, guess what? What? The deal is even sweeter, 'cause it's Mother's Day. For just $10 more, you double the berries and you get free cake truffles too. I don't know what those are, but does that excite you as much as it excites me? It really does. I'm sure that it does.

I don't know, it was trending, I would say, um, from this dude named Post Mesmer. Um, and his tweet was, what's your game of the year for the last five years? Quote tweet this and everyone share your thing. So I did that and we had a bunch of the best friends out there share theirs and I asked you guys to do it as well. I thought it'd be a fun conversation because I I think about this every once in a while. Back when we were at IGN, there was a rigorous debate over what the game of the year was, lots of discussions and so much would go into that. When we started Kinda Funny, every year we have our game of the year discussion, but it's a bit more loose, usually exhausted by the end of it and we're just like, whatever you guys like, order",

Got to talk on the show. We do. Yeah, we just do it and then we we begrudgingly vote and somebody wins. I mean, last year, no one even won last year. Uh, while we were doing the conversation, there was a car alarm outside. They wouldn't stop going off the entire time. So we just at some, I think we got beers there. I think we got beers. We did. We did. So that was fun. But I it's interesting to look back because I feel like, you know, in the moment you have your choices, but when you think back on games, it might change because like looking at the this year, my ****, I was like, I I stand by all these and these were were what my game of the years were. But there's something that I'm like, oh man, did I thinking of it, did I like Grand Theft Auto V more than Last of Us?",

I think I like, I mean, I probably would have said Grand Theft Auto V at the time, but looking back, Last of Us was a much more memorable game and like the transformative game. And so my thing is back then and now, I still went with Last of Us. Sure. So let let me hit it off with my list. 01: Journey, 013: Last of Us, 014: Smash Bros. for Wii U, 015: Metal Gear Solid V, 016: Overwatch. Okay, what you got, Will? Um, I got Spelunky for Xbox 360 in 01. Okay. Like I still play Spelunky probably once a month. Game's amazing. Um, I got Super Mario 3D World and Zelda 3DS, which I think we're both 013.

Like there there's all the depth of all the old Mario games and it's this giant open world. Like each level is this giant open world, big enough for four. A great game. It's a 3D platformer. It's a 3D Mario game in 3D. And then like thinking about Zelda, going back now and looking at Breath of the Wild, what they did next and thinking, oh, oh, right, they were they were testing some different different A Link Between Worlds, a great game. They were they were thinking about different different ways to reinvigorate that and they kind of went a little bit with that and then they just blew it all over. Dungeons in any order.

Um, I did play Last of Us, but I probably finished Last of Us the next year if I had to guess 'cause it was kind of late in the year and and that time of year is always busy. Yeah. And then they re-released it on PS4 like super soon. So, but Last of Us, like Last of Us, like the thing that I loved about Last of Us, I was bad at stealth games for a really long time. Then I played um, Dishonored and um, oh God, what's the Klei game? Uh, the 2D side-scroller, um, Klei fighter. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The guys who do like Don't Starve and all that. Yeah.

And then I went right from there into Last of Us and I was like, oh, oh, this is a stealth game. I can do this. Yeah, I know this. Um, so I love I love Last of Us. I'm stoked. I'm stoked for The Last of Us or whatever The Last of Us. Whatever you call it. Yeah, exactly. Uh, 014, I got Mario Kart 8 'cause that game's amazing still. It turns out. Yeah. Um, better than Rocket League. Yeah, it is a lot. Yeah, two. You can hold two things and Dry Bones and Bowser and a shell. Totally, totally guards now. It didn't before.

If I if I'm playing multiplayer right now, play Battlegrounds probably, but that's a whole different different topic. Yeah, yeah. Um, uh, Rocket League, 015. Oh, I mean, damn. And then I got I wrote Overwatch and Dishonored II for 016. Man, I love Overwatch and man, I love Dishonored II. Give the fight for Dishonored II because we're not Dishonored guys. What? No, do you like, do you just hate things that are good? Yeah, pretty much. Okay. So Dishonored II had two. It takes you probably aren't Deus Ex guys then either, right? No, Nick was Nick is Nick is I Nick hurt his back, so I talk like he's dead. Okay, he's alive. If you if you my wife hurt her back, if you she might as well be.

The way you traverse that path is going to be different for everybody because if you want to play it like a stealth game, you can play like a stealth game. If you you want to hack a bunch of **** and just murder everybody, you can do that. If you just want to go through guns blazing and kill people, you can do that too. And instead of kind of leading you by the nose like a traditional kind of RPG or um, uh, I'm trying to think Prey. Well, Prey is the next game by the by those guys at Arkane. Um, it's it's you see you you begin to look at the world. You know that moment in The Matrix when Neo looks down the hallway and it bulges and he sees the code underneath.

Like I kind of want to spoil it because it'll it'll sell you on the game. I apologize in advance. There's a level in the the first the first bonkers level design you hit is called the Clockwork Mansion. You go in, there's nobody there. It's a completely empty level. You pull a lever and all of a sudden the rooms like the walls start pulling back and they're all like mechanically steampunky falling away from you and then they close back in in a different configuration. And you're like, oh, I have to figure out how to set up the the walls to do the maze.

Okay, I can see that. It's a good planet. Time passing. Good planet. Yeah, everybody loves Miller's Planet. Yeah. Uh, Overwatch. It's like TF2 modernized and awesome. And I played thousands of hours of TF2 back in the day. Um, look, you jump in the The Secret of Overwatch is actually the matchmaking. Like the mechanics of the of each character are great.

Like I'm always matched against people that are close to the same skill level because they ask me to say, hey, who is the best player on this round? Then then they can filter that into the matchmaking and match me with people that play like that person. And they build this profile of me. It's like in the same way that Amazon and Netflix and everybody does. But they know what I want. They know I want to have two healers and they know I want to have a couple of tanks and then I want to have some baller DPS. And they know I want to go in and wreck house.

You don't have to know the meta to be fun and fun and be good at the game. So fun though. And every time I jump in, it's like I it always gives me the satisfaction that I kind of know what I'm doing. And I'm like, all right, cool. Okay. 'Cause like it reminds me of TimeSplitters back in the day. I never got into Team Fortress 'cause I I'm not a PC guy.

I wish there was some single player **** that I feel like Uncharted is the first thing I've played. Like it's the first Uncharted game that I finished, right? It is an amazing Uncharted game. I always bounce I bounced off at the blue aliens. I bounced off at like some bad guy closet where they just threw like doing a genocide, man. I kill all these pirates. Oh, more pirates to come. Yeah.

It's it's it's a super smart game and those guys have all the levers and know how to pull them. Yeah, man, they're good at that. Greg, hi, give me your five. So here's the right now we stop the topic and give a shout out to one Giant Bomb who when I was when you said this was the thing, I was like, oh, easy. And I just put Greg Miller favorite game. I did the same thing. Giant Bomb and all the years **** myself over because they didn't ask me to do I guess in 014. So that was the first one where I was like, what did I pick?

So Uncharted 4 is what I picked last year, obviously. Um, you know, sucker for Uncharted. It was the end of it. I it's like I always say, I think it's an unfair fair fight 'cause it's not Uncharted 4. I'm saying it's, you know, every Uncharted up until that point has fed into me thinking that's the best Uncharted of the time and why I love it. But similarly, and then we'll get to this in a little bit. I find it interesting you brought up the fact of like, you want you could have given it to Uncharted, but Overwatch is the whole package, right? And when we broke away and started doing this and then even list I was doing on Giant Bomb, I found I was doing very I was in my as I get to number one because I would rank",

But like when I get down to 013, I was reading it. My description is like justifying why I picked this. I'm and I'm like, I'm picking this game because of the impact it's had on me. I understand that if I had to vote like we used to or and I I say the thing when we vote at IGN and I'm voting for this because of the complete package. But so Uncharted 4 for me, again, unfair though, you know, I love look, I've never climbed stuff as good as I did in that game. Exactly, right? Well, that's not true. Breath of the Wild.

But Uncharted 4, great. It was what I want of games. I love the story. I love the narrative. I I like the characters. They gave me all that. They were answering my questions as we played. And it's Uncharted. So great. Uh, 015 was Metal Gear Solid V. That, you know, game ate up so much time. And it's inverse of what I just said where, well, I don't know what the **** the story is, but I'm playing this gameplay loop over and over and over again. And I'm getting better and I'm unlocking this and I'm earning that and I'm upgrading. It was, you know, I always say, right? It was HD Peace Walker mechanics.

And I went and looked around and I was like, God, I I gave last year a lot of **** for like not being allowed of Greg Miller games.

I still think the better, hey, you need an all-around package. You need a game you're spending $60 on. You're going to get all your money's worth. This great. Got great multiplayer. It's got a great story. It's got great combat. But Gone Home is still the game that I think about a lot and I talk about a lot. And granted, I'm a broken record. And also everyone else is beating the Last of Us drum. It's not like you need me there telling you it's awesome. I mean, it's a stealth game. It's a shooter. There's giant plant monsters. Yeah, you get to play as the girl for one level. I know spoilers. So many people were about to do it. It just came out on PS4 like two years ago. Just sank it. You just sank that game, Chance.

No, I don't. I don't regret any of my review scores. I'm alive. Sucked. Lar was garbage. Uncharted 3 is a great game. But Uncharted, argue that Uncharted is not a great game. Now a fantastic game. May maybe I should have been allowed a review Uncharted and then we would have had some parity in the reviews and it would have mattered. But it doesn't matter. Uncharted 3 better than Uncharted 2.
