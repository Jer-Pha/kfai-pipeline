What's up, guys? Welcome to the first ever Episode 118 of the Kinda Funny Gamescast. As always, I'm Tim Gettys, joined by one of the coolest dudes in video games, Greg Miller. I'm going to crack open to find vintage of water, 2017. Mhm. Right off the Alps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait for it. There it is. That's my favorite part is that little, you know what I mean? And joining us for the first time, IGN's Alana Pierce. Hi. Hello. Oh, oh, multiple people clapped. You might know her from the internet as Charizard, which is a very fun thing to say. Big fan of the name in general. Fun thing to spell, but it's fine. It took me a long time to be able to wrap my head around it as not being a Pok\u00e9mon maniac.",

We're just racing. We're just racing. Yeah, Rin is racing. That's what I'm all about. Battle Mode was never my forte. I don't make any claims to be good at Battle Mode.

Yeah, where it's like, I've been playing online, and so it's just games journalists going, and I'm, I feel really **** good because I'm kicking their heads in most of the time. But then like, I was playing, playing, playing, and last week's guest, Andrea Seager, popped into the room, and I just went, '****, look, fu!' And he just like went, and he was gone. I'm like, I think I'm pretty good at Mario Kart to the extent where I can confidently say I will beat most people.

I saw that. Thank you. And I'm saying, you know, to the fact of like, they're like, 'Oh, that's unfair. You've been playing for a week before release.' And it's like, Mario Kart 8's been out quite a while. And when it was on, to be fair, yeah, it's a different game mechanically because of the dual items and the extra, the pink spark drift system.

People who are the Esports people like Sancho West scares me. Anytime Sancho West says he's going to play me in something, like, 'God damn it, here we go.' Well, I think that if you're good at Mario Kart 8, despite the changes, you'll probably be good at, right? No, for sure. Like, I think you could practice on that, and just things would be exactly. And that's the thing. One that you get scary. Like, there was a moment with Zayger where I was like, when we were going back and forth, back and forth, and Andy Cortez came up with the 150cc. When I, when I started baiting them into increasing their bets after I tanked Let's Play on purpose, I was like, 'Hey, what do you want to do here?' Blah. And Andy's like, 'Well, what about 200cc?' I'm like, 'No, no, not 200cc. I don't want to play 200cc. 200cc is dumb.' Exactly.",

I don't want to play 200cc. 200cc is dumb.' Exactly. Thank you. And I asked Zayger about it at like, for one moment, we let down our guards on our little rivalry. I was like, 'Hey, but how are you like good? Do you do 200cc?' He's like, 'Oh, no.' I'm like, 'Oh, God, thank God.' He's like, 'Drugs.' But I imagine that 200cc is like being on cocaine. Like, that's what that is. Some, some people nailed it on, of course, I'm Greg Miller, so I'm on the Reddit for Mario Kart, as you know. I'm a big Reddit fan, and talking to people there on that. And then people responding to like me and Zayger talking about it. They bring up the good point of like, the people who don't like it, like us, are just like, 'The courses weren't designed with this in mind.' So it's that thing of like, when I play it, it is that frustration of like, remember when you first got more, I don't think back to when you first",

And you like jump to 150cc, and you're slamming into walls, and you don't know how to do anything. And it's like, I, part of my brain's like, 'Oh, that's what's happening. 200cc, if I commit to it, I could do it.' But then on the plane ride out to Montreal, I was like, 'I'm going to only play 200cc.' And I was like, 'This is so frustrating. I'm not coming around on this.' Well, I think the, the issue is that you have to play the game differently. Like, we've grown up playing Mario Kart as being a, you never like, why is there even a brake button? Like, have you ever used the brake in Mario Kart? As I've gone head over heels into 8 Deluxe here, there's a few turns I am, I'm using B on while still accelerating, while still drifting.",

As I've gone head over heels into 8 Deluxe here, there's a few turns I am, I'm using B on while still accelerating, while still drifting, but having to pop down. I feel like you use the drift as the brake and then just adjust. That's what I'm saying. It's kind of just like a on-rails game to an extent where just like, you're just going and you're just controlling where it goes. But I think that the 200cc, it brings a different level of skill where you actually have to use the brake to maneuver the course. So it's like, I feel like for people that are looking for an actual challenge, like a racing experience that might, and that speed it up to, which would slow the game down a bit. Tried it on the Reddit. There was a discussion of 150cc versus 200cc, and there was a lot of people like us who just like, '150cc sucks.' And I put, I was like, 'I just, 200cc sucks. I'm sorry. 200cc sucks.' And then some, he's like, and it's like, of course, probably the monocle internet commenter,",

And then some, he's like, and it's like, of course, probably the monocle internet commenter, 'Evolve.' Just like, 'Well, 200cc's where real racing skills come through.' And I'm like, there's an argument to that 'cause yeah, you are doing. And that's why I, I actually stopped in the flight because I was like, I, my hope was I'd do this so I'd be like, how when you, you know, 50cc might have been hard for you, 100cc was hard for you, get to 150cc, you go back in your, and you're like, 'Oh my God, like, I can, I drift so easy.' I'm like, 'I'll do that 200cc.' But 200cc was making me play so much, so differently that I'm like, 'This actually going to **** me up when I go back to play 150cc.' That's pretty rad though, that something like a speed increase can make it almost feel like a different game. Yeah, it's interesting.

And I think that the, the kart series has evolved slightly over time to get to where it's at with Mario Kart 8, where when you compare Mario Kart 8 to even Mario Kart 64, they are very different games, and they, they feel totally different. And I think that with the drift mechanics and uh, getting to the 150cc, the courses are designed for 150cc, I think, at this point, you know. And especially, you know, with the addition of the uh, motorcycles in the, the Wii version, and then the all the, the anti-grav stuff. Well, the anti-grav stuff, which is kind of that, that's just a little extra ****. I'm talking about more the, the gliders and like the underwater stuff for Mario Kart 7 on the 3DS. It's like, once you get to 8, they've kind of like weeded out all the, the gimmicky stuff of it, and it's just like, all right, cool. There is a lot going on in every single course, has some of these elements being used. And so it's like, there is a bit more",

And so it's like, there is a bit more skill than there was in some of the other ones. Um, I mean, Mario Kart DS people really love for, but that's the one that got ruined by, by snaking and all that stuff. The snaking is again, that was like professional. I've never been able to say I'm good at Mario Kart. I didn't believe people could be good at Mario Kart. I'm just like, there's so much rubber banding, there's so much like, the game is just designed to have fun, you know? It's not designed to be better than someone else. It's designed to make everyone think that they're better than everyone. I've also seen arguments that like, it's such a game of chance that there's no way you can actually be good at it because you have no idea what items you're going to pick up. But by that logic, like, if I get first in every race, that shouldn't happen if",

I tried to teach my mom to drift. It didn't go well, but she'll get there one day. But then like, using items is like, if you're in the lead and you're far enough in the lead and you keep getting bananas, it's fine. Thing that's really going to is a blue shell. And that's the thing of like, where it's, when you play someone like Andrea, when you play someone who just peels away and is gone, you're like, 'Well, you are a better racer than me.' And that's the thing that that blows my mind. It's like, I felt like at the level play I've always done, like, you can't really be good at it. Is it's a game of luck?

And it's like, I just don't know what it is that they know that I don't. Yeah, it's insane. Well, I'm like, I, I feel like I'm drifting correctly. Why are so much better? That's, that's the thing of the tiered system. I feel like it is where it's like, when we were doing, when we, we've been playing in the mornings here, but when you guys were in Austin, we were playing on the TV, and Andy kept saying, 'I just don't get how good Greg is this good.' And I don't feel like I'm that good, but for that, I am.

If you drift once wrong one time, and you're in the thing, then all of a sudden you get to third, which means you're catching all the red shells, which means you're into fifth now, which means you're getting ****.

For the, I know where they are, but for the most part, it like, there's a strategy to a pro level Mario Kart player that I don't want to get. I don't want to go down that rabbit hole of, you know what I mean, of, 'I'm going to fall back and hang back to get a mushroom or get the three mushrooms or infinite mushrooms to then accelerate up there to do this to then make use of.'

You need a plan for that. I'm like, 'I don't want to get to that.' I respect that, but it also turns the game into math, which I don't want. Like, totally don't want that. But I, I have like routes that I prefer, but one thing that probably holds me back in my Mario Kart career is I always just play standard kart every time. It's always standard kart, standard wheels. It's because I'm used to it. So if I ever try and swap to the bike, I'm like, 'I don't **** know what this thing is doing.' And I'm just like, 'How do I turn a corner?' I don't know.
