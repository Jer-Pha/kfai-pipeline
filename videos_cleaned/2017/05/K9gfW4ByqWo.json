I always, because of my travel, I always have to have an end going. I always know when I'm traveling back. But the longest time we spent together was when I took three weeks off last year to go on one week vacation with my sister in Hawaii and then we spent two weeks together and then we did two weeks. Yeah, Christmas time. Is it different or does it feel exactly the same? Exactly the same. Oh, it's, yeah, it's the same. It still feels that better 'cause I don't have the anxiety of, oh, I need to leave. There is that impending, it still feels like it's going to end, which is weird.

So it was like a great week and a half and then she had to go back. But then once we moved in together, like for the first month, I'd say it always felt like it was going to end. Like it always felt like, oh shit, when, when do we need? Shit, you're never leaving. Well, Sunday before we got married on Monday, and Sunday I'm like, I got overwhelmed by travel anxiety. I'm like, oh God, I got to check in for my flight. I got to pack my stuff. I got to leave. And then I'm laying in bed and I'm like, no, I don't. This is really weird.

So we had close, close family and friends watch us actually get married and then everyone else was getting shit bombed at the reception already, which is the shit way to do that. Wedding was awesome. You just shit go to the reception and party. It's just, I think you guys are doing it right. I don't think you need to do the whole. We talked about throwing a cool party.
