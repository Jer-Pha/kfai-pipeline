Hello Rex, I'm very excited that you're here. You're here to show Knights and Bikes. Yes, that's right. You're aware that I backed this on Kickstarter. Yes, I want to get that out there everybody. I got a horse in the race. I've been behind this game from day one. It looked too cute not to back. Yeah, you've been very supportive. Now, and now here's the next question. Yeah, is Pory in this game? 'Cause I'm unsure of it. Uh, is you put out art with them to promote the PS4 version, which I appreciated and I approved. That's fine, don't get me wrong. It's come to PlayStation 4 thanks to your supporting Kickstarter. Thanks to my support, no big deal. Don't pat myself in the back, but you put out Pory in a bow tie with big glasses. Is he in the game? Well, I've done the artwork. All right, that's all I need to hear. Pory in a video game, Kev. We did it. All right, this has been a great",

All right, this has been a great Let's Play. We'll see. No, let's actually play the game. I'm so stoked to play this game with you. Uh, what is in a nutshell for people who don't know Knights and Bikes? So, uh, Knights and Bikes is adventure, kind of an adventure through childhood, really. Uh, we really wanted to make a game that was all about being a kid again. Um, you know, it's a common theme in everything from like Zelda to another game, and that other game was Knights and Bikes. Yeah. Um, so, uh, the the the premise of the the game is that it is an adventure, uh, with two girls, uh, who are on an island, uh, in 1980s England, right? And they're exploring this island. They're getting on their bike, they're pedaling around, getting into all kinds of scrapes and danger, um, finding treasure, digging stuff up. But we're also playing with the sort of, uh, the way",

But we're also playing with the sort of, uh, the way that kids see the world differently from adults, you know? So they're they're pulling up all these things that they think are treasure, but to adults it's just like a load of words, pocket fluff, and you know, just maggots. And I think what it spoke to me when I first saw it, right? And when you guys were pitching it, first off, I mean, your your pedigree, Media Molecule, you know how to make games. But was the fact that it was like Paper Girls meets Costume Quest, and then now like you toss, it's kind of like Stranger Things is in there too with the setting and stuff. Let's jump in. Okay, so hopefully you hit X. I hit X. There we go. So let's swap them around. Okay, do you have enough cord? Be careful with the cord. Okay, just let nothing run around.

Quest todos interactive evasive evasive roly-poly. Yeah, that's a very important. It sounds like it. So here they are. Gotcha. Uh, so in this particular mission, we are are trying to find this librarian character. Basically, characters are going missing from the island. The adults aren't really paying too much attention, but the kids are like thinking there's more to this. Um, so so your Nessa there, uh, in the purple, sure. And I'm Deza, uh, and we cycle around tapping the ta the X button uses off energy. When you run out of energy, up comes the little asthma inhaler. Um, you know, they're kind of want to like just bring it back to the real world all the time. Um, so so are there really nefarious things happening or is it just the girls are making up a story as they go? Well, I don't have to buy the game to find out. Yeah, I got you.

So, um, I mean, as you can see the game, the game's all 2D, but in a 3D world. So everything is just, you know, a lot of drawing for me, basically. Um, these bikes can go in three different directions, and I've had to draw and animate them doing that. So, uh, another time I would just make a 3D bike. I think you think you would to do that next time? I think so, yeah. How how big is the team work your Foam Sword? How many people? Uh, two. Exactly what I thought. Yeah, you're a crazy person. Why why why? Uh, I don't know. It's just it's just quite nice to have a have some time to like just sit at the kitchen table.

It's a really nice like work-life balance, really. Um, so I didn't do any cool skids, but anyway, I I do plenty for. I'm sure you did. So we're off off our bikes now. So we got a bunch of moves here. Um, I can like do a kick, you can throw water balloons. Gotcha. Uh, if you poorly evasive, yeah, if you do Circle, uh, you throw a big balloon, and then I can run up and I can, when I've got some energy, do a ground pound. Look at this combo move. These are the kids love the combo. Exactly. Yeah. Now, can I play this by myself or does it? You can. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I don't think any any AI is going to be as fun as playing with another person, you know?

Okay, so we got to have a race. Oh, damn it. Ah, shortcuts. Now you know you made the goddamn game. You made the damn game, Rex. He was going to win, Kevin. You know, sometimes the developers, they let you win to make their game look better. Not today. You guess you think this game look good enough. So, uh, here we are with a bit of combat.

So although, uh, like we saying, there's only two of us like full-time on the game, we've got a couple of collaborator friends, uh, that are doing the audio side. Oh, nice. Um, so, uh, old friend Kenny, who did all of the audio for LittleBigPlanet and Tearaway, uh, he's doing sound design. And then, uh, the composer is a guy called Daniel, who, uh, he's become super super Hollywood these days. Uh, he did the score for Steve Jobs, Man from Uncle, and what else? He's got the new, um, uh, Guy Ritchie, uh, Knights Power Rangers. What's he called? No, Kevin, is Guy Ritchie working on Power Rangers? No, my apologies. Cockney Rangers can go little.
