Okay, now what of course happened is a while back DiGiorno followed you, Tim. DiGiorno followed me on Twitter last year, February 2016. Nowhere in February 2016, nothing prompted this. I didn't talk about DiGiorno, wasn't talking about pizza, didn't tweet at anybody. They just followed me and I was like, \"That's weird. This must be one of those things where on Twitter like they follow 40,000 people. They're just, yeah, they're just trying to",

Somebody followed me, knew.\" And I don't understand why. So then I tweeted about it and I was like, \"Holy ****, DiGiorno followed me and this is real. That's weird.\" And they responded and they're like, \"Oh man, hey, you know something nice.\" I don't remember what the **** it was. Then a fan responded to that, including me, and said, \"They should get, bring back the buffalo chicken pizza for GameOverGreggy.\" Then we go silent. We go silent for 14 months. Nothing else. Out of the blue, DiGiorno responds to my tweet because I responded, \"Yes, sir, totally.\" They respond to my tweet with a finger pointing down and it was the return of the buffalo chicken pizza.

We open it up, there's seven DiGiorno buffalo chicken pizzas inside this **** with a note from DiGiorno. That's the most important part is that's actually, let me go get the note. You, Tim, talk about it. It's G. So I was, I was shocked by this because when I saw this, I was just like, \"Wow, this is the long con.\" Like they, they, they saw this tweet a year ago and they're like, \"You know what?

I'm just playing information here that I don't think that we have correct. I think the buffalo chicken pizza's been around for a long time. There's, I, at some point this guy must have just come across this tweet. This is not a new product. But is the stuffed crust part of it new? I don't, is my question. 'Cause some guy had said, \"Yeah, when we started talking about this again, they were like, 'Well, no, I've seen the buffalo chicken in my store, but I don't know if it had the the stuffed crust.'\" Regardless, I'll tell you what, I check Andronico's every **** week and there's no buffalo chicken frozen DiGiorno, other otherwise.",

And it turns out, yeah, you can barbecue a pizza. You can use the grill to warm up a frozen pizza. And so we did the DiGiorno buffalo chicken stuffed crust on the grill. Delicious. Andy Cortez, come here. What's your review of this pizza? 30 review of the DiGiorno grill stuffed crust buffalo chicken pizza. I was stunned at the quality of this pizza.
