Welcome to Kinda Funny Plays. I'm Tim Gettys. I'm joined by Dan Tanguay, the director of Crash N. Sane Trilogy over Vicarious Visions. First off, hey, oh, hugs. Thank you. Oh my God, thank you. The Bandicoot has been saved because of this man. So I don't know if you know my history with Crash Bandicoot at all. I do not know. Oh my God, first off, in love the Bandicoot. I always have been since I was a weed little lad. Then I get older and as time goes on, I'm like, where, where is the Bandicoot? Why, why is he not in my life? Right? Every show, time after time, it's PSX, it's E3, all these different shows. We do predictions and I'm like, the Bandicoot's going to come out. This, we're, it's going to be safe. This is going to happen. And it never, never happens. Right? Until last E3. Until last, I lost my mind. So here I am, nice, and I get to play and I'm very excited. How",

I mean, um, it's an honor really to be able to bring it back for folks. Um, you know, we have a lot of love, uh, for Crash Bandicoot at Vicarious Visions. We actually have a bit of a history with it ourselves. Yes, yeah. Uh, we've worked on a number of, uh, Crash games in the past games. Right? Yeah, we did the GBA games. Um, we also did a Crash Nitro Kart, the sequel to Crash Team Racing. So big fan of Crash Team Racing, big fan of Nitro Kart as well. But you know, Crash Team Racing will always have that, that's special place in my heart. That's a special place in my heart too. There you go. So let's get right into.

So you know, one of the really important things for us, want to see that death animation and it legit just capturing the personalities. I mean, Crash is full of personality, but you know, so are the enemies. And, uh, yeah, got personality to spare. Yeah, I think Crash has about over 100 death animations in the game. Wow. How many was there in the original games? Oh, there about 100. Yeah, made our, uh, animation and, uh, VFX teams cringe a little bit. But you know, they got to do it. Got to do it.

Yeah, now with that, we, uh, actually went back to the original tracks and we were able to extract, uh, the rhythm tracks and use that as a guideline and then built, you know, new instrumentation to, you know, give a a richer, fuller experience. But yeah, I guess the, uh, everyone's digging the end results. So really exciting. All right, good. Remember that TNT crates are, uh, yep. Yeah, some people seem to forget that. But I don't remember the super spinning sound though. Yeah, now, uh, we, uh, basically unlocked some of the power moves here. Okay, that makes. Normally, normally you would have unlocked that for, uh, defeating, I don't know, I'm going to say N. Tropy, but don't quote me on that. Got it. Got it. Got it.

Yeah, you just found it. We got the, uh, Fruit Bazooka. Oh, now you can use the, yeah, you can actually, I like that. Yeah, we changed some of the, uh, controls a little bit, uh, just, you know, really to kind of cater to a more modern audience who is used to, you know, playing FPSs and things like that. Good call. So what's changed in this version of the three games? Well, um, let's see. I mean, let's talk about what hasn't changed, I guess, to start with is that, you know, for us, you know, was very important to capture, you know, the original gameplay. And you know, we kind of define that as, you know, okay, the level layout, the crates, pretty much the challenge. Right? And so we actually",

And so we actually started with, uh, the, um, original gray meshes from the PS1 game. Sony gave those too. The original what? The gray meshes. The, um, gray meshes are basically kind of like the, the skeletons for the level. And so, uh, you know, it's just like you're playing in a a gray abstract world at that point. And it's not very detailed, but it gave us kind of a blueprint. And so on top of that blueprint, we were able obviously to layer on top of all the lush art and audio and all that. Uh, but it also allowed us to actually start remastering the gameplay, specifically handling and moves. Because we know now that this jump is this long, then you got to jump that far. Or, you know, these crates are this high, so we've got to jump that high. You know, with that blueprint, you know, we just got right to work. Mhm. Um, so you know, that is",

Uh, but you know, uh, there are very subtle things that we've done just to, you know, oh God, yeah, those guys, uh, those guys, I think you got to jump on their heads, maybe a double jump and do it. Oh God, there you go. So, um, all right, so we're remastering the, uh, jump and moves and things like that. And, uh, that honestly took a while. That took us pretty much the entire development of the project to really nail down. Cause we do it for one game, but then there are subtle differences in each of the games. So, you know, uh, we had a team of designers and animators assigned specifically just for working on Crash through the entire project. Awesome. And it's like, yep, you got to work on jump again, guys. I'm sure they were, oh, they were actually thrilled though, you know. Well, I mean, I'm sure that people are",

You know, it's, it's, it's got to look great because the original one, you know, back in the day, was one of the best looking games on the PlayStation One. Oh yeah. So we had to make sure this look great. Um, it's got to feel right. And you know, uh, especially, yeah, uh, given that, you know, now gamers use analog controls, it's, it's a little bit of a challenge. Mhm. Um, because analog really wasn't introduced at the beginning. Um, that was introduced, uh, I think in the second game. Yep. And so now, you know, we've got to make sure that, you know, a game that was originally designed for, you know, the D-pad, mhm, you know, actually works well with analog too.

Let's do motorcycle first. Okay, switched up a bit. Cause you Crash Warped, a lot of vehicle levels. Absolutely. Yeah, no, um, that's really where they went all in on vehicles. Um, let's see, is it this one? Yeah, it is this one. So there you go. My favorite, uh, Crash theme is the Warped thing. Nice. Yeah, it, it actually, uh, I think, uh, you know, got stuck in our heads this past week. We've just been whistling nonstop at this point. But, um, my God, yeah, in on vehicles. I mean, we've got motorcycles, jet skis, scuba gear, airplanes, the whole, the whole bit. So, oh my God, this is like, oh no, yeah, this is so funny. This brings me back. Oh ****, I can't.

I'm mean, see this. So yeah, so what are the controls on this again? Uh, these controls are pretty straightforward. You've got gas, brake and turning. Uh, and then it'll automatically drift a little bit depending on how you turn. You know, I've been Mario Karting it up recently. So, y- yep. Yeah, it's a, it's a little simpler than a, oh God, whoa. Oh God, that's all right. A will help you out ending that Tokyo Drift there. But, uh, yep, these are a great, uh, kind of novelty. Yeah, novelty is a good way to put it to, uh, you know, break up the on foot gameplay. And you just got to get first to earn the Crystal and move on. Oh God. Um, but still, they're a lot of fun.

Uh, but we decided that, well, we're making it for one, might as well making it for all three. Oh my God. So now all three games, you got to try this. Catch. Now all three games have time trials, which, you know, we're pretty excited about. Yeah. Oh no, wh- see, this is, this is not good. All right, see if we can gain back some ground. Dude, it's this turret. Yeah, I imagine those cops aren't helping matters any either. So, uh, what else can we talking about? Um, which of the three is your favorite game?

Not like Amateur hour over here. Amateur hour. All right, hopefully I am not also Amateur hour. We'll have to see. We'll have to see. So when it comes to the, the Platinums and the trophies for this game, how's that going to work? All right, so, uh, full trophy support as you might expect.

Like I, I replayed one recently. I beat one for the first time. Well, congratulations. Years. Cause that one's hard. Yep. It's really damn hard. But I beat two a bazillion times and I replay that one often. Mhm. But I don't know why I just haven't went back to this. So I, I've been waiting for this version. Oh, good. All right. Since it's not super easy, I'm just letting everyone know. Oh yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Crash is still a challenging game.

But that's why I, I worry that a Warped's not going to hold up as well as the, as two, because it has so many vehicle levels. Cause I remember even back in the day, the, um, jet ski levels being very difficult. Mhm. Oh, you're so close. Oh, are you going to do it? Oh no, D. Hang my head in shame. Oh man. Well, you shamed me. So that's fine. And so we got one more. Right? One more level. Okay. And that's Gone Tomorrow. That's one of the, the last levels in Warped.

Yeah, that was bad. See, I'm all off with the, the mechanics. I've been playing so much Crash One without all the slides and all the craziness. I think slide there. So this is another level that we like a lot.

And then we said, well, jeez, you know, the original games did it 0 years ago. We're going to have to do it. Step it up. So let's step it up indeed. And yeah, we got reflections into the game.

Next, you know, everyone gets fur. Everyone gets fur. You give them a la cookie. Yeah. And then, uh, they're like, well, we could use the fur to make feathers too. Like, okay. So, so all the birds have feathers, which are based on fur. It's just, it's quite possibly the furriest game I've worked on. Okay.
