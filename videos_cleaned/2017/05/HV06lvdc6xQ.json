Woo! That was yours was way better. You like this? You ever do that? How do I do that? You kick up your foot. Come on, get limber. You're rolling around the shit pits day and night. It's got to get something over there. We can do the whole show like this and it's like we're like riding out of control on a Disney ride or whatever. You know when you like when you get a real good handle on driving for the first time and you're like, you know what? I can fuck do this. I can drive with one leg. True story.

I remember one of my friends whose names I'll leave out of it, his dad drove stick and it was the first time I'd been in not the first time but the I mean cause again, stick's stupid. Nobody should drive stick. We the cars have evolved out of stick. You don't need stick. I love stick. But like he drove and he was so bad at it. Just like I was like, this is terrible. Well, I used to be the jam. Stick used to be the jam. But that makes sense. You got to drive it to stick was never the jam. Stick was like, hey, guess what everybody? We built a car and this is how we're going to do it. And then it's similar to how people were like, hey, guess what? I'm God. I built a horse. And we're like, hey, we built a car.

Henry Ford built the car and then with a stick cause that's all his little mind could think of, right? And then some other guy was like, you know what? We don't need the stick. You know, the car can do this on its own. Don't know if the first cars had a stick so much as they just put it into gear and then didn't they took it out of gear. That's true. Guess wind these up. Remember? I think like one gear. Yeah, they only went like five miles an hour, 10. Stick's awesome. Stick's only awesome though if you have a car that is a sports car that is fast.

They just took off. They went to Outback. They haven't come back yet. The brakes are mostly fine and you know that you know that mostly the ABS system that's not quite working the way it's supposed to, which is fine cause honestly, you don't really need the analog brake system. Your brakes can lock up. You can just power slide around corners. Mario Kart has taught me anything, it's that that's how you win. Power sliding is how you win. Drift.

Steven Spielberg, who developed the original as a follow-up to the success of his Tiny Toon Adventures, is expected to be on board in crafting in the updated version. There's no home yet for Animaniacs and insiders caution that it's still in the early stages of development. But 1990s nostalgia is big business these days. Witness the success of another Warner Bros. TV title, Fuller House, which is one of the most watched Netflix originals. Did we know that? I did not know that. In this, we know that Full House is do that question. Do we know that?

Like anything, try to do everything you can before you hit 30 because once you hit 30, your life is pointless. Or 30 is awesome. And I'm actually honestly saying that right now. I thought I was dreading 30 as well when I was saying, I'm like, \"**** man, like I'm going to be 30.

That's not that's not enough to make, no, not really because often times the these uh the budget doesn't really include a lot of the marketing. Um so I'm sure they generally say, I think I think the rule of thumb nowadays is you need to make 2.5 times more than the movie cost to actually make a quote unquote profit. Ah. Um so yeah, they're probably not going to, oh look, okay, sorry about that. We have two extra tips.
