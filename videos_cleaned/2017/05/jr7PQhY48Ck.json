There's a good point to point out where the base model of the Honda Civic, uh, so Honda's very like, I think the rule that the the dude helping us out at the dealership told us, yeah, he was like, uh, \"Hondas, um, Hondas aren't allowed to be taxis.\" Like they're kind of snooty about it. They're kind of like, \"No, we're not we no, Chevys can do that or whatever can do that, but Hondas, no, we don't we don't let taxi services have Hondas or whatever.\" Do taxi services don't want it 'cause they're bad?
