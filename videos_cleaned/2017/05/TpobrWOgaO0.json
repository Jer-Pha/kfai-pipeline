Well, and that's, I mean, that's one of those in real life, like, like the tutorial stuff. You really punched him? That happens. It was it was that thing of I'm on the bridge, these are my controls and Tim's over there and I was like, but do this. And he was like, as close as you are. I went like, oh God, I'm so sorry, not the face. Um, it's one of those things that like, the tutorial thing that you mentioned is a is a real key thing. Like when we when we make 2D video games that live on a TV screen, like they can steal UI prompts from stuff that's that's come 30 years before. Um, when you're building a a game",

Like we don't know how the what the user interface and user experience should be like for those experiences in a 3D World. Cause like in the Real World, which is 3D and is how we interact with with everybody every day, if you need to convey a bunch of information, you send them an email or they look at they look at a piece of paper or something like that. Reading isn't great in the goggles with the current resolution of the displays. So we're having to build all these interesting UI elements that are like kind of mimic Real World objects.

And we did a bunch of work to smooth it out and make it work better, but it still wasn't wasn't a great experience. Yeah, we ended up just making a physical object that pops up in the world when you hit a button and you reach out and grab a ball and you move the ball with your hand across the line like you're scrubbing through, you scrubbing through a YouTube video.

In terms of substantial like capability changes, so things like higher resolution screens or or, you know, eye tracking inside the headset or like, there's even research projects that have come out of Siggraph where they put electrodes around the the edges of the mask. Oh my God. And it tracks the face face the eye-tracking muscles. It tracks the muscles contracting around the edges of your eyes and and your cheeks so it can detect smiles and stuff like that.

If anyway, I I think we're going to get to that point sooner than we think, but it's I don't think this year. I think next year at the earliest and maybe even the year after that, depending on uh hardware vendors. The Steam VR side's a little bit more wobbly though, because it's more of an open platform. So, you know, Oculus is building Oculus hardware. Anybody can build Steam VR hardware. And like, if if HTC decides they want to spin a new version of the Vive before Valve thinks it's ready, they can go ahead and do it. I think so.

We are committed to it. We know what happening. They put it out. There're Batman, there's Star Wars, there's all these like franchises for you to grab on to and understand.

But the fact that you can't go in and out, that you lose that Z-axis makes it really hard for people who want to port games from Vive and Oculus over to that platform. And then the other thing is that it's much more expensive to develop for a closed platform like the PlayStation than it is to just jimmy something up in Unity and jam it out on Steam.

When you talk about a lot of game developers talk about verbs in terms of what you can map to controllers and and verbs that are accessible to players when they're playing a game. So if you're playing Call of Duty, you can jump by pressing the the A button. You can shoot by pulling the trigger. You can aim down the sides by pulling the other trigger. You can move. But there's not any variation. When you have the ability to reach out and pick things up with your hands, all of a sudden a lot more verbs are accessible to you. And the variation inside those verbs is also much more available. So if you're talking about knifing somebody, you know, in Call of Duty, if you're if your cursor is in the right place,",

But if you have hands, you can reach out, you can swipe down, you can jab, you can swipe across, you can swipe up from the bottom, you can block, you can throw your sword across the room and stab the guy with a flying sword. Probably don't want to do that with VR. I mean, don't let go of the controller. But yeah, exactly. It's all good. It's perfectly like, don't let your kid in the room when you're playing VR. That's a pro tip. Um, yeah, exactly. Daddy, why'd you hit me? Um, that that hasn't happened for me. Then they tell the kids at school, knock the door. No, it's all bad.

I see something like Breath of the Wild is a good example. If you're making an open world game in 2017 that's shipping after Breath of the Wild, you can't climb up stuff.
