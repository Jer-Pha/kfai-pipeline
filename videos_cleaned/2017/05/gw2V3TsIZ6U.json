What's interesting about all, all the dynamics of like being able to like go up into the 3D space, yeah, of course, high gravity with all the stuff, fly around, do whatever you need to. It's, it's got a different feel to it than Overwatch. I didn't play a lot of Overwatch. I play, yeah, a few rounds, got my ass kicked and then left. Same thing here.

Is somebody who isn't in this ecosystem of gaming where it's like, okay, that looks cool and I'll play it for a little bit and then bound, similar to like Injustice, right? It looking at it, my concern would be how the Overwatch audience is so invested in, so into Overwatch, right? Will they make time for another one? And if they won't make time for it, will there be a community around it to keep it going? See, I think GNA in the, in the comments hit it here on the head, says this takes more skill to be honest. And I think he's right. There's a bigger learning curve with this, I think, than when I picked up Overwatch. I'm like, okay, I kind of get this.

Um, no, I think they have to keep that there for, it's like what we got into with uh, Zelda, right? They have to keep that there because you need something on the Xbox One to make people still feel like the Xbox One is, you know, worth their time, worth the money they invested in it.

And then it's also the same time. I remember there was one really negative Reddit thread I was reading and I was like, **** everyone's so mad. Well, and I I went back, I'm like, oh, well, it is a lot of the same names actually being repeated when you go through to see who's talking. Not that I'm trying to say they don't matter or something like that. But we put out the survey, right? And I think we were all blown away by the amount, the number of responses, thank you so much. And the number of, you know, we thought hot button issues we put out there of like, how do you feel about ads? Because we see your comments, we understand when people are upset about it. And so many people are like, oh, we don't care. It's",

I always associate it as being negative, but there's also the vocal minority that's just talking. That's what the vocal minority is. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad. So that's a longwinded, I don't know, gave the answer. Roy never yell at us. No, and they couldn't. We would just tell them to **** off. And then negativity on the thing, it's I'm not concerned about it. I hope that as we continue to move on and we continue to make products and we continue to make shows, we can turn it around.

That's the thing I've had to learn is I guess the fact that I see people in there having the same arguments day to day and it's like, well, we did a show about that or we did a topic about that or I said a statement here and it's like, like I got to let what I'd like to see, you know, the quiet majority.

I was in uh, Frogging Bullish 89 says, Nick, what's weird about the criticisms of Covenant is people knock it for being predictable for for predictable and kind of dumb characters. But the masterpieces that are Alien, Aliens had similarly dumb characters and predictable structures. I think Ridley's new direction is making man the antagonist and creation as the moral quandary to discuss rather than being a straight up Alien movie. It is a good and I think it is a good movie and I think will age well over time. That's that's a good perspective I think to have on it.

So like I think there would have been a better way to introduce those in a way that didn't feel like they were at every juncture breaking the logic. And I'll disagree that I don't think there were any real dumb characters in Alien other than like if you if you remember Alien had there was a there was this crew that was incentivized to go look at this thing on this planet by money and that kind of makes sense, right?
