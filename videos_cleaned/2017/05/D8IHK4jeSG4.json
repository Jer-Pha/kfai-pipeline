Okay, so this spoiler mode, we can take the gloves off. Uh, did you expect The Unfinished Swan thing? No, I totally ****. It was totally that thing where the wheels clicked into place where cuz the kid was named Morton there too, right? And I didn't think about it, didn't do anything.

And yeah, and Ian Dallas said on Reddit that yeah, it's totally canonical, like The Unfinished Swan is that he is the the king of A.C. when he disappeared and nobody knows where he went. He went into the painting and it was like, what a brilliant **** thing.

That I I mean like then just the the regular narrative like going down and like this guy you thought was gone or dead or whatever just has been living under the house for forever, like Jesus. And then he finally comes out, gets hit by a train, like Jesus. What a great, what a ****. The shooting the deer for the first time. Oh yeah, yeah, that was tragic.

And then when Giant Sparrow put it up, uh, way too early, said our next game is Edith Finch, and then they tore it down a few hours later. You're like, Sony's probably not happy about that. Well, and I played the um, the animal part at Judges Week two years ago. And so that was literally two years ago I played that part. And so that's why I was like, I was the same way for the game of like, been dropped by Sony, right?

This was probably four months ago, five months ago. That was literally, it was, it was like a triptych. I think they released three pictures. Is that what a triptych is? I I don't know.

But I was such an Unfinished Swan fan because that year I do think, I think I can't remember if I voted for Journey, but I think I might have. You might have voted for The Walking Dead. Yeah, that that was **** awesome. But I remember stumping hard for Unfinished Swan just cuz I thought it was so great and love the narrative and I reviewed it and I call it like a like a hot.
