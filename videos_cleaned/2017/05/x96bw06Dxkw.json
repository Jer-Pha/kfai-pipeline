The watchmakers' goal is to change the way the consumers think about fashion by offering high-quality minimalist products of revolutionary prices. MVMT Watches started just $95. At a department store, you're looking at 400 to 500 bucks, but they figured out a way to just cut out the middleman and make everything way cheaper, providing the best possible price. We're talking classic design, quality construction, and that style minimalism everyone's always talking about. You probably stopped being late to that thing that you're always late to, and hey, you might as well look good doing it.

So a couple months ago we did a topic, the two topics actually, that were every game coming out before E3 and what we thought about it, if we thought was going to get delayed, sure, and if you thought was going to like set the world on fire or whatever. There was a ton of games, but this was post-Horizon and then E3, and keep reading. Now I want to do the same thing before E3 happens, of all the games that we know that are either hammering a release date in 2017 or that are said to be coming out in 2017, and a little kind of go from there. And also it's the discussion of what games are we most excited for. My all-time iPad app on you **** it with it. I don't want people to know. They need to know. Starting the first big one for me, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. Super damn stoked. June 30th. Hell yeah, get hyped. I'm looking forward to playing it.

Yeah, like did you media, did you play your FPS X-Ray? Did you weigh it, Appendix? I was a little worried playing one because I love the original Crash Bandicoot. Haven't played it in a while. I don't love it as much as you do. Um, it's not a good game. And just that the secret is, I don't think it's a great game. And so like that's why I think the remade pretty. But I was worried. I'm like running at the camera, you're on some ****. Yeah, that's why I think, I think it always, it, I think they are fixing the problem, the things I hate about Crash 1. Yeah, nothing. Are they? They're adding analog control. Yeah, definitely. I mean, if you played it and don't lie, you to straight-up don't like it, then they fixed you ****. Okay. And okay, son.

The problem with Warped, Warped's my favorite, but the problem with Warped is it has way too many gimmick levels, that ways for many vehicles. We have many like random **** that are not just plants. Also Jack, sorry. And I don't think those are going to age well. I think the rest of it will be what happens. You beat this game, Louis on, you unlocked CTF. Dude, you're not even **** heavy start like this. It's not, it's not possible. It's not got impossible. But if you were taking - this year, it's a pull off the year dreams blurry.

Yeah. Oh, I'm into little throwback to the last topic, Mario Kart, to prove an example. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Share playing that technically. Yeah, it's like when I play on good systems, it's cool. I mean, whatever. I played the hell out of it on the that we use. So you didn't, you weren't thinking, I'm not saying I'm good, and it had the hell out of it. Me, you haven't had a real match since Switch came out. Any time you know that we stop this video right now, I feel like there's like seven people at IGN. They're better at Mario Kart than you guys.

It's damn very Sam. I would love, we should do something where I come over and play because I'd love to come play legend. They're starting a little bit of a week. All right. Yeah, bunch of the new, new class. I brought you. Yeah, what's up with Nintendo on the mind? Arms coming out June 16th.

And I think that it has that Splatoon quality charm where if they focus enough on the characters, they'll be invited to the next Smash Bros. And they will be Nintendo like on mascot. You have Squid Kids. And I think that it's going to find a lot of success within certain markets. That markets definitely. It's not going to be the general gaming public, which we saw with Splatoon, same thing. But family's going to love it, and the people that are dedicated to playing it are going to enjoy it a lot. We'll see. That's just from me playing it. Playing it with the most controls is pretty garbage. Playing it without most controls, pretty fun.

Yeah, scotoma. I call it getting bucks because I don't like it. Yeah, have you played it? No. Okay. Any other day. I mean, how obvious is it? Look, it makes me think it's a motion control game where nothing's gonna hurt the general public. And I think the box art and name are pretty generic. Yeah, that's the thing of like, you, I feel like looking through it in a store shelf, I'm like, I want to. But again, there's not that many Switches out there. There's not many, there's not that many AAA games for Switch. If there is a little bit of buzz, a lot of being, all right, maybe people get mad.

Yeah, well, Arms, Splatoon, and a shooter. You know what I mean? I get upon a day. Yeah, more Power Stone. No. And I love Power Stone. So I'm like, all right, I'm gonna wait. The jury's still out. We'll see where that game lands. But I don't know. Then Splatoon 2, July 21st. Again, I'm happy that I'm gonna give you another chance because I had fun that one time we did a Let's Play. Yeah, I'm at, it's one of those really like the, the Wii U. Exactly. I was so over with Wii U at that point. I never gave the game a chance. I'm gonna give it a chance here.

But Splatoon 1 slowly became a relatively big hit, especially given the how this whole Wii U's are out there. So by almost five million copies. Yeah, in exchange in Japan. Fran Mirabella liked a lot. He just does not like Nintendo stuff. No, Destiny never made its way to them. Exactly, exactly. Um, yeah, I, I'm excited for this. I hope there's a sort of big lean into a single-player thing because I'm, I don't really have time. Yeah, I mean, dude, that's my thing is I'm hoping for it. I don't think they've talked about.

Not only problem that when they were going, the relationships are invisible. Isn't funny of a robot. This robot's not that funny. I don't love this robot. No, I wasn't a very lovable robot. There's a very good level books at that time travel. I'm sorry to have to time travel. You know what? I don't give a shout out. Hey! Pikmin on the 3DS. Welcome aboard. Y 8. Yeah, I'm not down with this. I'm not that we're theater again. A, why isn't this on Switch? B, why is it happening? Yeah, which it just seems like mice. Have you heard of this Hey! Pikmin?

It sort of reminds me of like the Mario vs. Donkey Kong: March of the Minis that I would like every one every year. And you're like, how? And it's there. Like, I think their whole thing is like, Pikmin's too complicated for children, so we're going to get them in with this. And I'm like, stop it. Stop it. Don't. Also, what about Switch? I click it. I really don't want to open my 3DS. I mean, now it's over. Just bad. Middle-earth: Shadow of War, August 22nd. But I had to play that. Yeah, I mean, I thought I'd really like Shadow of Mordor.

Combat is awesome because it's Batman or ever when that's what this was all supposed to start at. But then it was like, all right, cool. Go over here, a million guys. Go over here, a million guys.

Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. Also, I do like this. Yeah, I was very excited for this game. Yeah. Oh yeah, I'm so excited. It's then being like, it's that with sort of middle ground lengths between like, it's, it's longer than behind, but it's shorter than a traditional Uncharted game. Yeah, **** following the two of them. I'm totally not exactly. Yeah, I know it'll be fun, different. That's what I want. That's very high on my list. I'm aside for.

Yeah, I **** with his life because I mean like big implies like I'm destined like area or whatever. And I'm a psycho, psycho. You Destiny. Look at it. I know. I chasing his name with something, babe. Yes, you're crazy. No, I played a bunch hours of first when it was still Destiny vanilla or whatever. Got a little or whatever. 1 or whatever where I didn't have to worry about anything more. And I was, I had fun with it, enjoyed it. But his rough came back a little bit for dinner rules. But it was by that point there were so many people so invested who knew everything.

And by the time they're like, all right, time to worry about raids in lights course. Oh my god, peace guys. This is why I feel shame to try to remedy that and give because Destiny is one of those games that like launch at like a six five and you ended up being like a nine because once like The Taken King came out, they're like, all right, you finally delivered two years later on what this game should have been. Yeah, which is what I take a lot of people feel about like Uncharted 2, Don turtle on AC to Daisy won. Well, I think, you know, especially all the games that live online, you know what I mean?

Yeah, I didn't seem to be **** huge. And obviously like you mentioned earlier, we're gonna get a lot more in a week next week. Yeah, yes, the 19th. Yeah, I'm hoping they reveal some really cool **** and like it because like what I loved about The Division and not about Destiny was first off setting. But that aside is the fact that The Division, I felt like, cool, I can play this single-player and have a great time. And then if I do run into somebody, we run around and **** around.

Yeah, yeah, it was really good. And it was a tone where it was, I mean, obviously Nathan Fillion was the voice actor, but it's felt like Firefly, Borderlands. And like, all right, that is a tone I can get behind. Yeah, if I don't need like gritty, just like wet blanket. And that was the thing is like the tone for the original Destiny, right, was lost and weird and not there. Literally recasted the narrator.

Like Andy is the bad guy in the first season of Parks and Rec. And so, well, I don't know why I'm comparing Destiny, Parks and Rec. But by the time that their third season, they're like, oh no, he's not the bad guy. He's like the lovable idiot. Yeah, yeah. We got a Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite on September 19th.
