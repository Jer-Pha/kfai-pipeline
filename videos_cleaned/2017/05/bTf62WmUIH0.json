Oh, there was he really thought that was the Star Wars Day, 'cause we were talking about the, you know, it's gonna be May, it's gonna be May, yeah, that whole thing. And yeah, Nick just got confused about the whole thing. Nick get confused is just before after the old man blew out his back getting out of a car. It was somewhere in between all of it. He also misread mimes as memes, and someone made a joke about getting attacked by mimes and nobody heard it, and he he read getting attacked by memes and nobody heard it, and it's just like, Nick, oh, I miss him though.

That's that line you walk with personal injuries to your friends where you're like, oh, this sucks, and I know to be in that situation would be the worst, but right now you look ridiculous. I think also because it's not like a forever kind of injury. Exactly. It it's okay, I think. Although it sucked though, 'cause you could tell he at that moment he thought that was the rest of his life. Yeah, he was like, this is it. I'm just going to die here. He's had a bad back forever. He has had a bad back, but not like this. Yeah, this was special. Yeah, something special like Andy was scared. Like Andy was legitimately afraid. It sounds like you should be. Yeah, yeah.

One of the most photogenic weddings I'll say of all time. But back to my point of the beginning of Sean though, I love Sean's end product, and that's what I think of most. I forget how in the moment he is and how great he is at directing where he's literally like, all right, turn your head a quarter. Now bring up your now put that in.

The game is set to be an open world action adventure that includes a focus on exploration and environmental puzzles and will continue the series' staple hacking/slash combat with new protagonist Fury. It's set around the same time as the events of Darksiders 2, which was released almost 5 years ago, and will follow Fury's quest to destroy unique physical versions of the Seven Deadly Sins.
