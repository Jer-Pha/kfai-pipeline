It's only three more days to our birthday, one of your hosts, Greg Miller, alongside the producer/seducer Nick Scarpino. Kevin, did you say it's one, only a few more days to, three more days till his birthday? Big KevDog's birthday coming up. What are we doing for your birthday, Kevin? This is something that Joey Noelle brought up to me today in my Uber over here. She texted me, said, \"Are you guys doing anything special for Kevin's birthday on Friday?\" I said, \"We are now.\" Yeah, I've been, I've been plotting and scheming. I'll tell you what, here's what I think we'll do for your birthday, and you tell me if this sounds good or bad. Is it going to be offensive? You're going to hold me down and bong. We're going to wait one week and then we're going to throw you the coolest live show anyone's ever, ever seen. How do you feel about that? Oh my God, yeah, what, wow, it'll be on the, uh, it'll be at the",

June 3rd, if you want to get a ticket for it, you can go to KindaFunny.com/KFL. I was going to say, I don't want to, I don't want to bring out the fair-weather birthday fans. A lot of people just come out for birthday parties, they don't even actually care about the birthday. We shouldn't advertise it as Kevin's birthday, we should advertise it as Kinda Funny Live 3. However you think you want to get butts in the seats, that's the way you do it. Yeah, we get Xavier Woods in there, act like it's about this, but it's really Kevin's birthday party. Yeah, his surprise party. We'll sing Happy Birthday to him. That'd be so exciting. Kevin, what do you want for lunch on Friday? I don't know. I don't care. What does this mean? What? Why you got to be like this? What?",

I, the final PS I Love You XOXO is up right now. Yesterday, during filming, Kevin was over there working stuff, and I haven't edited a podcast in a while, obviously, because we're taking some time off since this all happened. I noticed that I am constantly looking over at Kevin, like I am right now, right? So, as good and big as the TV is, Kevin, you need to get a bigger TV to block you so we stop looking at you. We keep looking at the camera. I've been saying, let's get a curtain for, I, I mean, since the last place we were at, sure. I'm, I'm now, I'm now believing you on that, and I'm going to back you on that. I can't see Kevin at all 'cause his TV is so big. I can't see him. The camera's smart.",

But I was saying the fact that I don't want to look at Kevin anymore, so I need to start training myself to look over that.

Okay, I need Nick Robinson to chime in then on what his deadbeat schedule looks like for Thursday afternoon with Adam Sessler. So the way I, you figure, right, is, yeah, Cool Greg can easily do a GOG with Jared Petty, right? Easily. But he cannot do a Gamescast, correct? I, I don't know. I know how little Tim knows about games. I know Cool Greg knows even less. Sure. Unless we're talking about Harry Potter Lego. Well, come on now.

One of the Fall's big Nintendo Switch games will be Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, a game that has been rumored for quite some time and does indeed exist, as confirmed by art assets provided to Kotaku. The game will mix Nintendo's iconic plumber and friends with characters from Ubisoft's popular Rabbids series.

Ubisoft is developing Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle on the publisher's proprietary Snowdrop engine. According to assets we've seen, the game's selling points appear to be A) turn-based combat, B) two-player local co-op, and C) a goofy sense of humor. No, whoa. The art we've been, the art we've seen features Mario and crew wielding guns that shoot laser beams. The game will apparently have eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Peach, and bizarrely, four Rabbids dressed up as Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Peach. The existence of the Mario and Rabbids crossover was first reported by Laura Kate Dale, who became infamous over the past year for ruining or running various rumors about the Nintendo Switch, including some of the correct.
