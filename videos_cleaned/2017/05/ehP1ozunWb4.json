I'm ashamed to say I have not seen Schindler's List. It comes up maybe once every three months in conversation around, around a lot of, a lot of, more often than you think, do the Jewish people here. So we're talking about Nick, a movie guy. Yeah, I'm a movie guy. I recently um, did a couple episodes of the Schmoedown, um, which is a show on Collider's network on YouTube.

This character in Schindler's List is the only one in color. That was the question. Yeah, that was the question. And I guessed and I got it right, thank God. Yeah, I got it. I was like, I have to guess because I can't let it. Is it multiple choice? Yeah, well, you can pick multiple choice for less, for less uh, points. Um, and I picked multiple choice the entire time because I'm like, it's easier. Um, but it's one of those movies that I really at this point, really as a film buff, really probably should see. Yeah, and I've just gotten, is great in it. I've just gotten to a point where I'm like, maybe I just won't watch it. Maybe I'm just like, it's gone too far and I just got to keep going.

So a lot of that I end up just going one of the capture bays and just watching movies. And uh, Schindler's List was one of them where I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do, everyone's talked about this for so long. And I'm like, it's a damn good movie. It's one of those ones I never want to watch it again, sure, but it was, it's a damn good movie.

That's a bad guy. It is a very strange movie, but it is a movie that you've, I've heard of forever and it's finally on Amazon Prime. And I'm like, I'll give this a watch. The main character is a neurosurgeon slash samurai slash rock and roll slash scientist, like inventor. How I not? And he goes, it's called Buckaroo Banzai.

So I want to know if there's anything you guys are ashamed to admit you haven't seen or if you can think of anything off the top of your heads. And does this include books, video games, whatever you want? If the movies are too, too narrowed. No, I was just wondering. I was just wondering what I, I feel like for me, the list would be so long, I wouldn't even know where to begin. I, I lack so much classic movie knowledge. Mhm. Like I've seen a whole bunch of garbage, sure, but I, I haven't seen a lot of like Daddy's Home. Daddy's Home. Haven't seen Daddy's Home. Oh, you should watch it.

No, that's, I only know it from pop culture references. Yeah, where they're stuck in the 80s in San Francisco. Yeah, they're here. They're here. Genius. And they filmed, it's hilarious.

Yeah, it's one of the Snake Plissken movies. They decided to remake it and call it Escape from L.A. That was garbage. Which was the exact same movie. Literally. It is a sequel, but it's pretty much the exact same movie. Surf, surfing, right? He surfs. He does. Peter Fonda is there. Like Surf Ninjas and 3 Ninjas. Exactly like that. There was maybe a turtle in there that was radioactive. I don't know. Um, Big Trouble in Little China. Pizza. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Overrated. But again, that's the movie I saw as a kid. Totally holds up.",

Hey, Kevin, can you look up what Chinatown was based off of? Was it a Deep Throat situation? Like there was a lot of, there was something like that. Deep Throat, like the porn or Deep Throat, the uh, no, say in Chinatown was based on a Deep Throat situation. Yeah, of an informant. No, I think you might be thinking about uh, All the President's Men, which was based on the Watergate scandal, which is another movie that if you haven't seen, I hadn't seen. And I watched it. I'm like, f***, this is really good. I saw that one. I not a Dead Space in this topic. I did not realize. I think, I think, I think it's 12 Angry Men. Speaking of, so good. Yeah, I should see that.
