And again, we're taking for granted how **** cool that reveal, the 'Would You Kindly' reveal was like when you didn't know that was coming. You got there and you were like, holy ****, that's awesome. Not to mention, like, in terms of environmental storytelling, I think BioShock does it so well with picking up Audio Diaries and continuing to explore and scavenge for things and feel like, you know, some this is an old argument, but like, is BioShock a first-person shooter because you get three bullets and you're really not supposed to fight anything until you have to fight something?

Like, no, like the way it all comes together as a package is what we're talking about when we talk about video games in the media. Well, there's a bunch of problems I have with BioShock Infinite story. Like, oh, BioShock Infinite, yeah. So like, I I played that game and then I played it again. So clearly I enjoyed the gameplay, but weirdly I don't remember enjoying the gameplay. It's like just the fact that what you are doing in that game versus what you had told the stories about are two completely different things. It's like you're told that it's a story about a girl, but what you actually do is just **** kill people the whole time. And it's like that is a limit",

And it's like that is a limit of the medium. Like maybe BioShock Infinite would be an example of something that maybe would be better as a book, but the gameplay is great, so it kind of doesn't matter. Like we just kind of like passively take it and it's fine. And that's the thing. And I think that's the one of the, you know, comparing Bio, I mean, BioShock, you know, the original comes out in BioShock 2, different development team, but not even the remotely same league. BioShock Infinite, you hope it's going to be the return to BioShock, BioShock, BioShock, because there's just so so much going on and it is like, wow, Americana, and this is going to be awesome.

I don't need to think about this. Like with the violence thing, they tried to tie it into the story by saying Booker is a violent man. But that's the thing that I look at as like they figured that out afterwards, not beforehand. It wasn't like Booker is a violent man, that's a part of who he is. And then they were like, oh, we kill a lot of people, let's make that a part of the story.

It's like, yeah, such a disconnect for that game specifically that like I don't think BioShock 1 had. I think BioShock 1 was incredibly strong in terms of storytelling. It just like was probably weighed down if anything by the fetch questy **** sure, cross Rapture, yeah, of course, of course. And that's the thing, video games are a balance, right? Where BioShock Infinite gameplay is fun, sure, but it **** up what the story you think or was going to be or should have been kind of thing, right? The games that find it somewhere in the middle are like, it's good story and it's good gameplay. Those are the ones that stand out. And you talk about, do you guys play Enslaved? No, oh, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, yeah. Like I really liked that game and like the gameplay was good for when it came out and the",

It kind of like gets messy, but I feel like that's an example of a really good balance of those two things, even though it's like, it's still parts there that it's just like, defend the girl and it's like, just throw her up on a ledge, whatever. But it's still super fun. I mean, I think more recently in similar vein too was Horizon, where Horizon's gameplay was awesome and I was blown away by how much I enjoyed that story. How I was like, ****, I'm I want to go do the next main quest because I want to know what's happening to people, you know? So Uncharted is another series that gets thrown around a lot when you are talking about story. And a lot of that isn't necessarily even just the plot, but it's also the characters involved.

The whole of Madagascar, Uncharted 4 was just **** amazing. So so I mean, the whole franchise is so great. I mean, Uncharted 2 is better than 3, but it's so great. Um, but funny, IGN.com says it's a 10. Yeah. Oh, yeah. When when you take, I'm gonna go edit that. When you take Uncharted and you're like, okay, what if it was just a movie? Like you take all the the main beats of Uncharted because like besides the main beats, like the collecting the random treasures and stuff, that's not the point of the game.

Like usually honestly Uncharted story gets made fun of, right? Lazarevi\u0107 is just drinking blue sap. Okay, whatever the **** know. I mean, how did Talbot disappear in that dark alley? Whatever. Well, there's that story, but then there's the story of the relationship. Exactly what Uncharted succeeds at and makes Uncharted stand out and be so beloved is the fact you love Nate and Sully. You love Nate and Elena. You love all these people interacting with each other. And a movie would never get that in two hours. Yeah. And the subtleties.

Like that's all I wanted in was to see her and know how she felt. And that's interesting. And that it's like three separate parts of a game. Like the actual treasure hunting story, that's history. The relationships, which is what I actually care about. And then the gameplay, which like I really wonder what Uncharted would be like without as much shooting. Like would we enjoy it as much?

The one liners that make you laugh and chuckle while you are negotiating this thing. When in doubt, climb. Like that like, you know what I mean? Like that's something that wouldn't play as a one liner in a movie to make you care more about Mark Wahlberg's version of or Nathan. You know what I mean?
