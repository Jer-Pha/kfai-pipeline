That is what started Start on IGN. Remember back in the day IGN had started Start which was a YouTube owned and collaborated channel basically. Yeah. So YouTube came to a bunch of creators and said \"Look we want to we want more original content on the platform. Uh we want longer watch times. We want people to be engaged more. We want to help start start to craft a little bit higher quality content that's going to YouTube yada yada yada.\" They didn't exactly explain it that way.

But technically they also bought Revision3 so they were next to each other. But here's my question. Did YouTube still own SourceFed? Because so so that's the thing is I don't know all the technical stuff because obviously everyone has their own deals. But going off of what I do know based on other people's channels they at the very least owned it up to a certain extent right? I don't know when that extent was. Yeah I we don't know the details of the deal but it's it's important to note that it was a at least the co-owned channel. Yeah.
