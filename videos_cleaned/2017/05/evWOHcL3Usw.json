It's my favorite game by far. Yeah, that's true. I've been playing it for 74 hours. I only have one date so far. So looking at this, this list top 10: Mario Kart 8, which is understandable; Persona 5, above Zelda, above MLB 17 The Show, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, Grand Theft Auto V, Mass Effect: Andromeda.

You got what else? The newest game on the Black Ops, sorry, I was like, Jesus Christ, wait, when did MLB The Show come out? I'm pretty sure that was really recent.

This is, uh, again, over at IGN. Um, Alex Gilyadov says the 13th season of Supernatural will include an animated episode featuring Scooby-Doo. Nice. Supernatural stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles announced the special episode this morning at the CW's upfront presentation in New York. You can check out the first image right there. Uh, Supernatural's dabbling cartoon imagery before in Season 8 episode Hunteri Heroici. There's also a Japanese anime version of the show, which first premiered in January 2011, following the events of Season 1. The 13th season follows Sam and Dean going up against a powerful creature that can either save or destroy the world. So there you go. Cool. Um,",
