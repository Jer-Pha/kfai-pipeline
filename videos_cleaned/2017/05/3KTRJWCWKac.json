Welcome to the first ever episode 119 of the Kinda Funny Gamescast. As always, I'm Tim Gettys, joined by one of the coolest dudes in video games, Greg Miller. Hey, hey. And for the first time ever, joining us, Will Smith. Hi. Hello. Will Smith, did you guys know which Will Smith I was? Let's just get it out of the way. How long is your life, you know, being Will Smith but not being that Will Smith? Look, I'm a middle-aged white guy. My life is pretty easy. You got the Twitter account, so you, you won the battle. Look, I, I got, I got the twit, all of the accounts. I have all of the accounts, you except for Snapchat, 'cause who needs Snapchat? Too old. I'm way too old for Snapchat.

So if like they hit me with a \"Getting Jiggy Wit It,\" that means they were in probably Middle School in like 1999. And that means that now they're, you know, so yeah, exactly. It's a lot of Scientology jokes, a lot of Jaden people on Twitter get really pissed off at Jaden Smith, like unbelievably. You will never hear the end of it. And I, it's always just like, \"Get your son, man.\" Like they're just talking about how shitty of a dad you are and you're just like, \"Man, I don't have, I don't have a son. Leave me alone.\" Your daughter, just daughter. So how old is she now? She's four. Four. Oh my God, she four. She's like a small human being.

They teach you like when you go to the parenting classes, you'll find this out soon. One day when you're not soon. Everybody, there's not embargo information. One day, one day when the time is right. But, but no, you go to the class and they're like, \"Okay, you can do the football hold, you can do the Bread Basket, you can do the,\" and, and the, the head cup with the body strewn out along the leg arm is one of the, it's one of the recommended ways to do a one-hand baby carry. The one-hand baby. It's crazy to think that at one point all of us fit in someone's arm and now she like, she's like that tall. She runs around. She's, she's riding a two-wheel bicycle now.

There's that you teach them how to balance with the glider and then they pedal later, or you teach them how to pedal with the training wheels and they learn to balance later. Oh, so 'cause I've been seeing there's like a rise in popularity things. Every time we go out, there's these kids cruising around. They're like, like half scooter, half bike. So yeah, you're on the seat, but you're just moving your little feet around and like you skip your feet off the ground. Yeah, like we went with the traditional, we went with training wheels.

I saw, I saw an electric adult Big Wheel the other day that the guy said was like 60 miles an hour, which sounds like it would be terrifying. That sounds too much. Too much. But I was at this weekend, I was out at Kate O'Brien's down in S hanging out and I was on their little outdoor patio and this guy and two girls rolled up on those things and the bartender came out and shooed the **** with them and then they rode off and and it was like the most traditional San Francisco conversation of like, oh yeah, he's the CEO of some tech startup and he just buys those for $100 off Amazon and rides them around the city.",

Holy crap. Now my next question though, back to the Will Smith topic before get too far gone from talk about video games. I'm sure you love never get. Was there a weird moment for you 'cause you're friends with Gary Whitta, friend of the show here, the most storied GameOverGreggy Show guest. And then he go, yeah, he's been here the most. We can't get rid of him. I mean, he is like fungus. The legend is he might still be here this day. How is he? Has he done three full episodes? Three, three full episodes of the show. Where does he?

Yeah, he gave us his Spotted Dick once and then it just hung out forever. We never ate it. Has he, has he, he made you eat cockles? I don't think we've had ****. Oh, you should make him bring cockles next time. Next time. Okay. They're delicious. Sounds like Gary's getting an invite soon. But was it when he did After Earth and stuff? Jesus God. So there were, there were two moments that were really weird. One is that like Will Smith got famous while I was in high school and I grew up in a small town in the South. So everybody that I was in high school with, I'd known for like 10 years at that point. Nobody like, nobody made that connection when The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was on TV and the guy's name was Will Smith and like I",

Um, and then, and then it like his career kind of spiked and then it kind of waned and by the end of the '90s, like Wild Wild West completely bombed. I was like, thank God, I'm finally out of this nightmare hellscape. And then Independence Day hit and I was like, ****, okay, so here we are. Wer and he just keeps making the Willennium came out. So yeah, uh, Gary wrote After Earth, which was one of Will's more recent kind of big budget action movies. And I kept, he kept just texting me pictures of him hanging out at Will Smith's place in LA.

They did a panel like two years before the movie came out and I was there for Tested stuff. Yeah. And and like Gary's like, \"Hey, you want to come to my panel? Come to the, come to the lobby of the Omni and you can walk over with us and we'll take you in the, in the Green Room.\" Will Smith wasn't there. It was, I was going to say, here we go. No, it was like his, it was like his overbook production team, all that. They were all there. So I met his brother-in-law who's, who's one of the producers on the film. Introduced myself and the dude just started laughing and fell on the ground. He was laughing, literally rolled on the ground laughing when I little too much.

Tested.com. That was your old G. Yeah, I did. I started Tested in 2010 with Norman Chan. Um, we worked with the MythBusters the last few years and we got to go do a bunch like I stood on top of a nuclear reactor while it was running and looked down between my legs at the blue glow of Cherenkov radiation. Okay. Just a haunting, haunting color you can only see at a nuclear reactor. Before, after your daugh, two weeks before she was conceived. So I'm hoping for superpowers. There's still a chance.

We could do it, we could do in this room right here. We could make a cartoon version of this show if you wanted. Well, this sounds like an excellent segue into our first topic.

If you're watching this, if you watch this on YouTube, I won't be here the week it's posting on YouTube because I'll in LA for E3 Judges Week. Oh, this is a huge honor. Uh, I've never gone to Judges Week as a judge. I've gone to Judges Week as I'm an IGN and underling, like a chud. Yeah, because they, they do the whole thing. If you're unfamiliar with Judges Week, is that Geoff Keighley assembles the Super Friends of video game publications and invites them there to see games early that then they'll see other games at the show.

Jud only. Yeah, judges only or Judes only. We'll throw you a bone and lift the Velvet Rope so you can come in and play whatever dragon game somebody's crap out and you play and then you, you write nonstop about it and you'd feel like, oh man, if only I was a judge.

Do you want to know what I'm, I'm planning on doing? I'm bringing the old school notebook and I'm going to take copious notes on these games so that when these embargos do lift, we can either do topics or breakout segments or whatever reactions as they call them here.

Today's topic is VR. Let's talk about it. The virtual reality, the future of it, but also the state of it in 2017. I like that a lot. So where we're at now, we got all the big guys are out. Oculus officially out. Sure. Uh, PlayStation VR been out for a while now. Half a year. Yeah. Um, Vive is there too, right? Yeah, killing it, doing its own thing. What does this mean? Well, you can go to the store and buy them. It's true. Can you? Because this is the problem. Every time we talk about PlayStation VR, it comes up as, oh, the people in the chat, if we're doing on Twitch, I can't find it in my store. Hard to find. Yeah, but then there's other people are just, I'm at Target. They take a photo.",

And so I don't know what the line is to buy anymore because that was the thing when Andrew House did that interview with Business Insider or whoever it was, Business Times, saying like, you know, we screwed up, we underestimated demand, we didn't get them out fast enough. So now I'm not sure where demand is anymore. If that was a moment in time where everybody wanted it, 'cause you know, with us being you, our audience mainly PlayStation focused, or at least me being a PlayStation voice, I don't know why I get, you know, pay that picture. I, I don't know what, what it could possibly be. Uh, our audience, I, you know, they talked about how hard it was to find.

But I don't hear people bitching about it. And it was what, that's kind of, that's kind of what you want on a new hardware launch. And that's what I, I had, I, I said for once, I thought the tone had been set of, hey, PlayStation VR's coming. It's Gen 1 and you're making an investment on unproven tech and you're not going to get a AAA game every month and blah blah. And rather than not listen to that, buy it and be pissed off, it seemed like the people who are hardcore enough to buy it and pre-order it knew what they were getting, bought it and then just chilled out. But even now, I do, now I am starting to see the crop of what am I playing on this? Where is it going? Well, I mean, so, okay, so there's a, there, this is a lot, this is a big. You ask like a",

I'm working on it. Um, it's, we're just now reaching the, if you think about the way I think about VR, real VR has hands, right? Or at least a track controller. It's like the PlayStation, the way PSVR tracks the, tracks the, the DualShock or even, even, even the track dual, like the Move is good. The, the Move is interesting because it's like really good on X and Y and it's not so great in and out from the camera. Um, the, the track DualShock is actually my kind of preferred uh, PlayStation controller for most of the games that I played. You know, the, the even like Rez and stuff like that. The, the hands are the real, the real key. And Valve introduced the Vive at E3 2015, which was just, just now two years ago. I mean, sorry,",

So like if we're talking about a game that somebody who didn't have early access to the before announce, meaning like the Job Sim folks and and the Northway's making uh, uh, fantastic interaction and stuff like that, then then we're just now at a normal AAA game two-year development cycle. So we're, we're, we're just like, and you're seeing that stuff starting to come out like Resident Evil 5 hit. Um, what is it? Superhot's coming out, coming to Vive uh, later this month. It seems like they started teasing that. PlayStation's finally talking about Farpoint again. Farpoint looks cool. Farpoint's the shooter, the shooter that they showed at E3 couple.

Um, no, we, we're like people are looking at the games adoption on the desktop side especially, but also the PSVR and they're thinking that maybe this isn't going to be a, a new technology that's driven by games. You know, they're starting to hedge and make bets about enterprise applications and stuff like that. So, you know, investments slowed down on consumer focused stuff, which is not great for video game people. But at the same time, the hardware is finally getting to a point where there's enough units out there that",

Um, you know, between Oculus, if you're building a SteamVR game that works on Oculus Touch and Vive and the upcoming LG headset and all the other stuff that's coming down the pipe, then we're looking at a million plus headsets now, just now, which, you know, isn't a lot compared to say the Switch or and nothing compared to PS4, Xbox or or Steam as a whole. So, you know, it's, it's a new market. We're, we're, we're still pre-iPhone days.

So there's a white circle that you have to be in basically all the time that the white circle's live and if you're outside of it then you take damage slowly. So, so they use that circle to kind of concentrate the the the action of the game. So the matches take like 20-30, well, I mean, if you're bad, matches take like two minutes, yeah, two seconds.

King of the Kill, right? H1Z1. Yeah, so PlayerUnknown is the guy's name who made the, there was an article in New York Mag today about him, but he's, he made mods for H1Z1 and I think Arma that were the same kind of mechanic. They, they credited him as the inventor of the Battle Royale game. Gotcha, gotcha. And um, it, it's, it also is squad based too. So you can do, so like if you matchmake as a single player, you can matchmake into, you know, one versus 100 basically where nobody teams up and it's just every man for himself. That's really tense and awful. But you can do Duos or or four, up to four player squads as well. And when you do",

You find a, you armor up and then you find a good place to hide out and what you think is going to end up being the center of the map at the end and like everybody watches one corner of the building and you're all in voice and it's, it's just awesome. We got to do a Let's Play on this. Only, only, hey guys, we'll figure it out. I run a virtual reality company. I have three portable PCs that I can bring over here anytime you would like.

You're pretty dope too. I appreciate that. Should have bought it earlier. Should, I don't think you should wait for one with more memory. Memory is so cheap. When cards, you cards are like $30 for micro SD and $30, $30 will get you a lot. Like you can find something that are like $10. Kevin, do we ever thank the guy who sent in the memory cards? I don't think so. Yeah, so apparently if Amazon will **** up sometimes, you order one memory card and they'll send you five and then you send the other four to your friends at Kinda Funny and then we all have Switch memory cards now. Yeah, Kevin, you remember the guy's name? Chester. Chester, thank you Chester. Thank you very much. But no, those cards are so, so damn cheap and I think that they're only going to get cheaper.

Like when it's going into Black Friday, there'll be a Black Friday bundle. There'll probably be a holidays bundle. I assume Mario Kart will be, will come with it at some point. It seemed like they held a bunch of like, it seems like the retailers were holding units for Mario Kart release and now those are gone and that seems to be the strategy where I imagine they're going to do that again for Arms and for Splatoon and whatever else they got.

Is there a chance at a Persona 5 Golden or whatever? Red, I guess it's a red, sure thing, right? I mean, I don't, I would imagine so. I don't know what if any the deal is with Atlus and PlayStation for Persona 5 exclusivity window or forever or anything like that. But I could easily see that happening and granted is down-resing this, that and the other. But I mean the PS3 version though, yeah, what? Oh right, the PS3 version. Yeah, yeah. I even there, I think you have to do, there's going to be concessions made, but I think they'd be worthy, they'd be awesome because I, I, that's the whole thing about Persona 4 Golden is like it was good-looking, but it wasn't the best looking",

Yeah, I mean, you don't, I don't play that kind of game for, for, I play it for story and weird **** honestly. I think you're more than likely going to get something like Persona Q where they do something for the Switch that is the Switch, whatever. It's more Persona ****. You don't do that. Yeah, don't do that. Goddamn single player dungeon crawling crap and like just go, yeah, okay. But I can see that happening because that is like, you talk about, man, who's the Switch's audience?

Super cool. Exactly, exactly. Final question from Joey B. How often do you guys read video game websites and forums? Great question. I never read forums anymore. I go to Reddit sometimes. Yeah, yeah, Reddit count. Yeah, Reddit's a forum, right? It's the form, it's the all the forms on the internet became Reddit and or NeoGAF. Yeah, or maybe Something Awful, I guess. Yeah, maybe something. Shout out to LX. No, I mean, we check the sites every day, but that's part of the morning show. That's when I'm usually doing it.
