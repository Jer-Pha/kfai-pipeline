And I'll never forget, I am, they had an event and it was like, we're doing a Walking Dead game and we're doing a Fables game. And I was like, wow, awesome. That seems, and I was a Walking Dead fan, this before the show. And I was like, okay, cool. Like that's awesome. I'm glad to see this is going to go on comic book world. But like when that hit, it was like, oh ****. And then as it kept continuing, they kept branching franchising Game of Thrones and then what they do with Borderlands and now the Marvel deal, and now which becomes Guardians. You're like, man, to Batman. Yeah, yeah. I'm like, holy ****, these guys are going. They just went nuclear. They, they're like, they aren't the, it's similar, I guess, in the same way they are the, you know, years of work, overnight success",

You know, obviously, full disclosure, I hosted the Batman show, which was just, I wouldn't pay for anything, was just, you know, I want to co-host Batman. But you go up there now and like, I remember when they had like 30 people and now like three floors and all hundreds of people. Like, holy ****, like this is a such a different thing. However, these problems still exist. The janky animations, the crashes. I, when I sat down, I'm like, all right, cool. I'm budgeting the time. I'm gonna play Walking Dead Season Three Episode Four.

Batman for me personally, in everything, it's always a different experience for everybody. For me personally, Batman 1 through 4 ran better and performed better than any Telltale game I played in terms of like, there were still the janky animation. Yeah, we're going to a cutscene and we'll come back and won't be, or we're going into a lot of audio just not be there. Yep.

Like, it's sometimes like, I'd be in the middle of combat, which is like actually really satisfying in their game. And Batman would kick someone and there wouldn't be a noise. Yeah. And then we got to Episode Five. And Episode Five was like, before that, there was the one where the guys were running around Arkham and they had no faces. It was just eyeball. Do the assassin creeps. But Episode Five was the same thing where, oh man, I'm into the climactic battle, then hard lock, dead. ****, restart. Get past that point, then dead. And then one more.

And that was one of the members a free when they showed us Batman. The world moves around the character rather than the character moving through the world.

It's like a channel. You tune in, you want, yeah, you want. But are they putting out so much to this? No time for somebody to go there, be like, let's blow everything up and rebuild.

End of March, we got the Episode 3. And now end of April, said today, right? No, today's Wednesday. So yesterday we got for Episode 4. I think the thing with that is they don't even have an idea.

And I think like, part of the thing with like, Episode 4 kind of historically being shitty is that they like probably plan out the first three episodes really solidly and plan out the last one. And then in the middle, they're like, I have no idea what we do and make a bunch of changes that still being made two days before the game come down. Yeah, it's like they have no idea what this. Yeah, it's like on one hand as a consumer, it's already cool. They're trying to get to us as soon as possible and they're working on my hands lately. All right, let's make it good.

Have we reached that point or is that point never going to be hit because it's fine and people will keep buying it? And it's better for them to focus on getting more IP to make more games that run this way. That's kind of what I think is that the point that it stops being fine is the point that stop people stop buying those games and the point that people start complaining about them all, which is like, obviously people who work in the industry do. But I think people who are Telltale fans do not care. Like a crash sucks, losing save progress sucks. But for the most part, they just will play all of them and not give a **** about it.

This Hitman is pretty much just gameplay, right? Yeah, how did you take this guy out? Well, I'm gonna eventually take him out that way. Hitman fans play those games over and over and over again.
