I mean, I think the last season was awful personally. I think the show season finale sooner than planned. Nothing happens. But also, I, I think that they would have wanted it to go on like 15 or so seasons, but I think, I think the 10, I think it, it'll end at 10. What's, what are we at now? Seven? Just end seven.

I don't think it's that spoiler. Come over. No, it's still going. But like, there's, I think you can look at what's happening where they left off this season, where they'll start next season. Next season will be All-Out War. All and then they'll, the finale will have a definitive moment. Then there'll be a blackout. Then we'll come back and we'll pick up with what happens next. And that'll be the thing where in to the general audience, they're going to be like, \"What the ****?\" And then I think you're going to have that renewed spark of interest that everybody's super into it 'cause that's how it's been.

And it was that thing of like people with this side or the other with the season and it was a weird one for me because I thought they did Negan so well for what I would have wanted out of Negan that first half of season. And then at the end it kind of started getting a little muddled or whatever. And then when they came back from mid-season break, I totally somehow missed it. This my whole life is like comics and Walking Dead and nerd stuff and it two, two week, the second episode aired and then that Monday on uh, the morning show, people were like, \"What did you think?\" And I'm like, \"Is it back? Like what?\" I didn't even, no, I fell off even earlier than that. Like I thought the first two or three episodes of the season were great and I love Negan's character being familiar with him",

And so I just, I didn't even come back yet. I will, I'm sure at some point just to like catch up. But uh, I'm thinking more just overall broad. Like we know the story, we know that no matter whether it's a video game, TV show, comic, there is this world that exists. There are the rules of the world and at some point the, the main storyline will come to an end. I think that Rick will die and that will not be the end. I think that'll then it'll allow Carl to older. But you're talking about the show, you're talking about the comic book overall 'cause I think the comic, especially if you're guys",

The comic will keep doing its thing. I would say it's flipped. I see Rick dying in the show being the end of the show. I think Rick dying in the comic is just the thing to push forward for where the story goes after that. See, I mean, I would think, I can, I feel you on it. I understand what you're saying. I would think in the, the show, Andrew Lincoln would be a huge, wanting to leave is a huge problem, right? And I think that's what they're eventually going to get to is that all this, all these cast members are going to want to do something else. And so how do you balance that and do that?

There's just too many **** people in there and like too many characters back. You guys read the, the book? I don't read the comic. I read the first two trades. Okay. Yeah, I read the comic. Okay. Definitely. Are you caught up totally? I'm not totally caught up, but uh, I know where, I know where it's going for sure. Yep. And that's, and then Nick, I don't need the comic at all though. I just get my updates from you two. And we totally, we're totally caught up. And it's like, there is, is it worth like for people who haven't read, is it worth going back and reading at this point? I think so. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah, you pick up the compendiums are 48 issues each. Um, I have every trade. I can just them. Yeah, it's a, it's, they're good read. They're quick reads too.

Because you know that's my favorite season. Uh, it's, it's totally different. I mean, it's so, it's like three issues. Okay. Yeah, fair enough. But that's the thing of like the comic, I feel like I want him, I'd like to pair it back. I like 'cause I, my favorite, you know, in the comic was like when uh, we were in there, everything's great. You know, prison life's happening and then we got ripped out of that and it was just uh, Carl and Rick for a while. And I was like, that's awesome.

That's where this is where I think the topic that I was trying to head towards is, is now that they've kind of done everything they can possibly do, every variation of this person died that way, this person died that way, this is what this leader, like this is what that leader, like we're at a point where it's like they can't just introduce another big bad guy and have a different camp and have Alexandria get run over again. And where do they go? And like I, I feel like where with the storyline they're going at now, there is a turning point that they need. Yeah, in in the comics, they need to make a decision that's going to move the series in a totally different direction uh, to keep it relevant. Um, the kind of like fanservicey end that I don't think that they'll ever do and it's a",

Oh, that would, that'd be awful. It's automatically awesome and awful at the same time where it's like, \"Oh, that's really cool.\" The all to do that. Was it Dallas? Was that the original show? People didn't, I don't remember them liking it too much when that happened though. Didn't go, that was not well received. The only cool about it is like it, the whole thing started with him getting shot and put in the, that's true. So it's like that would be one big mind. But it's like that is, there's so much that happened where it's like, that's a weird ass coma you went through. That's possible. I mean, that, that's my thing.

Um, I, yeah, my thing is I, I know that it's counterintuitive to what the show is, but I do want some level of closure with it. And whether that means, hey, we've, we've closed out Rick's storyline, we've closed out the, the original cast storyline. Like I would like to see Maggie keep going. I don't know if she's alive in the comic books or not. But show, I'd like to see her. She, it, it looks like they're angling for her to be the leader that everyone needs at a certain point.

Some concept of someone like, hey, look up the word flank and maybe use that from here on out. I Call of Duty. Yeah, exactly. Um, but you breach in there, breach and clear, do something, do something we like, you know. But but you know, I mean, that's the thing is I, I kind of, I was with you, right?

You got to use it a gentle. I love that. That's when you had to earn it. You know what I mean? You had to like work for it. Um, but no, but that's the thing is and then and then halfway through my wife was like, look, we should, it's on there. Let's just, we do have a Sunday. Let's just start watching.

He's like, and I'm like, yeah. He's, he's like, you need to read these. And it was volume one and two of the trades. And that was two had just come out. Yeah, I was like, ****, this is awesome. And this is before comics were digital. So I was like, I'm not going to buy single issues. I don't want to get back into bag and boarding. I'll only buy trades. And so what it was for me is that every time a new trade came out, I would read all the other ones before it to get caught up. So I know Walking Dead trades 1 through 100 so well. And then when they switched over to digital and that that's just the number I pulled out of my ass. I started",

Is the art like all the characters started to look exactly the same after a while? Like exactly the same. Like there was an image I saw online one time where it's like someone just added a caption that's like, look, this is Rick saving Rick from beating up Rick. Like, ho ****, that's hilarious. Yeah, and it's black and white so it makes it hard. But I had the same experience but in a much bigger way because you were trying to sell me on Walking Dead Forever and I was just like, I don't really like it. And then I gave it a real shot and I binged the entire comic series from issues one to like 150, which was like a lot. And then that was around",

Um, doesn't help if all like long-haired with beards now 'cause they can't shower and it's all black and white. It's all black and white. But then both the show and comic got a lot less interesting when it was week to week for me. Yeah, and and that's the thing about the show. Sorry, I lost this. The narrative there of like, yeah, like I, I don't mind. I'm treating Flash the same way where I **** love Flash on CW, but I've gotten so out of sync watching them week to week that it's like, ****, let them build up and I'll just knock them out on a plane or do whatever.

He's my favorite character even for even for the obvious reasons. And Abraham was probably a close second. No, Abraham was great in the show. Not there anymore. And um, you know, they, they, those are two big holes to fill for sure. And that's the thing is like, yeah, with the cast in the chemistry about it, there are so many different things of like when Andrea was still on the show, I hated Andrea. Yeah, and not the actress, she's fine. But it was just the fact of like, you're not the Andrea from the books. I, I love Andrea from the comics so much that like, who are you and why are you doing this? Blah, blah. And so like Michonne's rise has been great and her feeling Andrea's role in the show.",

It's just, we're beyond, we're so far beyond that.

It'll be interesting to see how long it goes because I mean, it is that thing of like, this is going to continue to print money forever and ever and ever in any. I mean, at some point Kirkman said he wanted to do 300 issues. Is that what it was? Yeah. Okay. And we're at, I think, yeah, so we're not even, we're just a little over halfway. But I mean, like, I just, you know, it's funny 'cause I was, when I was helping Jen move, she has my Walking Dead trade one that she had read. And I picked it up and I was paging through it for the first time in years. And that just that intro letter of him just talking about like, I'm, this is to me a zombie movie that never",

It's like, I, how it's one of those as his career skyrocketed and done so many different things. I really wonder what that is 'cause that's what Invincible must have been, right? Of like, yeah, I could keep doing Invincible, but I'm **** really busy. So I need to start killing my and decide which ones I want to do and do I want to go write more shows and do all these different things and work on movies? Like what has to give? And again, eventually The Walking Dead will have to give, you assume, in some way. I mean, I think that especially with Invincible, it's gotten to a point where I don't know what more they could do. They've done every angle and reverse angle of that. And like any like thing that you didn't expect has happened to the point that that series as a whole, how many",

So it'll end around 150 if not at 150. Looking at that, I'm like, there's only been a couple lows and overall it's been fantastic. And there might be like a 10 issue low here and a 10 issue low there. But overall has been great. Whereas with Walking Dead, it's like most of it has been really good. There's been a couple dips here and there. Yeah, when are they going to hit that point where it's like, all right, well, you've, I feel like they're already there where it's like, they've done everything. What else do? Right? Because you need to keep me going. Oh ****, the way that the series has.
