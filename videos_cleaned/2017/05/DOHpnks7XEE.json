Um, many tour made records. Oh, so trumpets. We had at one point in the late 80s, I think we had two at at the most one, uh, a guy, Jeremy Goody, who's still awesome and has a studio in Piedmont, um, still friends with. But over time, we lost the horns and were more of just like a punk ska band because we had two female singers and guitars and we felt that there was enough melody going with plus like ska shows back in the 80s, especially late 80s.
