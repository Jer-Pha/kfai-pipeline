If you've ever watched one of these videos, the idea is simple: you ask us anything and we respond. But what happens is over on Patreon.com, we post, I guess Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames. Now you can't just go to Patreon.com and expect to find this post without doing some research. Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames, we post over there saying, \"Hey, it's that time of the month, ask us anything.\" We put it up in the beginning of the month. You guys see who's going to be on the show, it's me or Tim or Nick or Andy or any of these other different people, and then you post questions there, and then at the end of the month we answer those questions here in this video that you're watching right now. So this is the games version. There's a Kinda Funny version over on YouTube.com/KindaFunny. That's about all I have to say about that. Let's get to the questions.

First question from Patreon.com/KindaFunnyGames comes from Joey Finelli or Fine. No, Finelli is what we're going to say. Finelli Joey says, \"What is one video game you never finished but wished you had?\" I'll give you two. The knee-jerk reaction was Vanquish. Played Vanquish, liked Vanquish. Then I was late to the party. Colin was always talking about how great Vanquish was. When I finally sat down to play Vanquish, I might have been for Game of the Year when we were back at IGN, and it was like, \"Okay, cool, I'll play it.\" Played a little bit of it, loved it, loved what I played, never got back to it. Just went on. Vanquish, not a long game, I could get back to it. The real answer, real answer, straight up answer: Catherine. Catherine, of course, from the Persona team over there, an Atlus game, came to PS3, was awesome. The problem with Catherine was it's really long, like a lot of the games from Atlus,",

I want to say I was gone for a week. And when I came back, I could not remember how to play, 'cause Catherine's ******* hard. It's a really, really hard, and it's like, you know, building the puzzle or whatever, climbing up the things. You had to use like the tornado method, I remember, for these different blocks. I totally ******* myself. Was, I want to say, 30 hours in and did not remember how to play anymore.

Feel like a horse's ass for that one, because Catherine was so good, and I would like to have beaten it, but I didn't. But maybe one day it'll get a PS4 remaster. I don't want to play through PS Now, but I could do that too, I guess, right? It's probably on there. I think it's on there. Uh, S. Rahaman. Ramen S. Ramen. Raman S. S. says, \"I know this question has been asked so many times, but I would love an in-depth opinion from my homie, Mr. Greg. I honestly have absolutely zero hype and/or reason to purchase an Xbox.

The thing is that they've kind of ******* it up, right? In the way that I have an Xbox One, I like it fine. I bought it knowing it'd be like my exclusives machine, and I'd play, you know, mainly on my PS4 for trophies, and now with my Switch, I'm playing on the road all the time. Um, the problem is that just canceled games and the exclusives they have put out haven't been like the best thing in the world in terms of reception or critical praise or moving numbers. You know, I mean, Halo and Gears don't do what they used to in terms of market share, mind share. They do really well in terms of numbers. We've seen the NPDs, we've seen those stats.

It, it granted, it was still a hold over of like the old Xbox One mindset of TV and games merging into one experience. I think that burned a lot of people, and that's why when Phil Spencer came in, was able to, you know, turn it around, make it about games again. But the fact of the matter is, what do they have for games this year, right? Like E3 is, is riding on Crackdown, Sea of Thieves, and State of Decay. I love State of Decay. I don't, I mean, it's going to be hard to be like, \"Here's the Xbox One, here's why it matters, State of Decay.\" I love it. I love State of Decay. Or what I love State of Decay.

I, of course, uh, pulled the trigger right away, bought my Xbox One day and date, had it on launch day. You know, had the PlayStation 4 on launch day. I wanted all that stuff. And like when they released the Xbox One slim, right, I wasn't like, \"Oh, I need to go get that.\" Of course not. I, mine works, and even if it didn't, I don't play it enough to justify getting another one right now. And so I think that's what they're going to be at with Scorpio is the fact is, you know, today on the Morning Show, somebody was asking me about, \"Do you think Crackdown is going to move over to be a Scorpio game? Uh, ditch the whole idea using the cloud to make the game better and use the core processing and teraflops of the Scorpio?\" You can't do that, because then you are into the Wii U Zelda situation, right?

Of like, \"Well, sure, Zelda should have just been put on Switch, probably, but you can't offend every Wii U owner who bought it for that reason or held on to it for that reason.\" E3, not only at E3 does Xbox have to say, \"Here's Scorpio, and here's why it's awesome.\" They have to say, \"Here's what's coming to your Xbox One, making Xbox One still relevant so that you're not burned by Xbox and then go **** Scorpio.\" 'Cause that's how it could go, right? Is if Xbox doesn't have big announcements and doesn't have big games and doesn't have any goodwill going into the Scorpio launch, why would anybody buy Scorpio? Right now, I'm at the fact of like, do not knowing what Scorpio is. Is Scorpio just a PlayStation 4 Pro, at which point I wouldn't be super interested in it to begin with?

Or is it like truly another step, iteration, whatever the **** you want to call it? Um, they have to do two things: they have to support two platforms, and they have to knock it out of the park on both of them. I think if, think about it this way, if, you know, Scorpio is, is just a more powerful thing, it's the next Xbox, but it's not the next Xbox, but there's going to be games that are amazing on it. But, you know what I mean? Then it would have been a slam dunk in the same way it should have been a slam dunk for PlayStation 4 Pro. But the messaging was so hard. Now the messaging is even harder on the Xbox side, because it is, how do I message this while also saying that everything's great over here? Like, do you come out and hat in hand and be like, \"Yeah, we've canceled some games, we've done that, but we have like five exclusives that are going to blow your mind.

They're just, they've really, they can't, they're, they can afford to make no mistakes at E3. E3 has to be from top to bottom ******* awesome on the Xbox front. Otherwise, it's going to sting even worse than just a normal E3 where like, \"Oh, we, you know, PlayStation had a better conference, Nintendo did something cool.\" This has to be, \"Hey, we're proving the validity and the reason you have these two different platforms on the market, why they matter.\" It's a tall order. I think that Phil Spencer and his team are up to it. I think they are smart folks. I think they have a good eye for games. I like the team.

And that's why it's been Quiet on the Western Front in terms of, \"Well, what is, what is Crackdown and State of Decay?\" That's fine. But what is the next big Xbox thing? We'll have to wait till E3 and find out. Nicholas Price says, \"Hey Greg, you often mention you would make a kick-ass Superman game. What would your Superman game look like?\" Nicholas Price, this is an old, long-running Kinda Funny, not gag, I should say, but idea of, \"Hey, I want to make a Superman game, and I want to make a pitch video for it.\" Very much like uh, Max Landis's pitch videos when he pitches a movie or something, or when he did the Death and Return of Superman.

So I need to go through and see that. But the Vita will be around for me a long time, you know what I mean? Because I think that's the, the upper hand it has on the Switch is the fact that there's just such a vast library of Vita games to play still. And so while Switch gets its legs and gets, and then eventually gets its arms, um, you'll still kick around the Vita. I'll still kick around the Vita.

I'm not a big trophy/achievement guy, but I think it would be awesome to get some little award when playing, especially once they finally roll out Virtual Console games. The second is more dealing with online play. I know it was announced before, but no chat in 2017 is crazy. Playing Mario Kart 8 or Splatoon with regular audio chat would be awesome. I'm also shocked by how poor the servers seem. Mario Kart 8 online disconnects, especially when compared to the PS or Xbox One. So my question is this: are these things we should be dismayed about?

But even that, I feel like again, as I was talking on this video about being short on time, now it's one of those things. I hit Level 30 in trophies, and like that was a good round, that is a good round number. To the point of, I was playing uh, Marvel Heroes Omega this weekend or whatever, right? And it wasn't until like five hours in, I like, \"What trophies look like?\" Because I, we, we talked about those in the Morning Show, and I was like, \"I'm not going to ever Platinum this game.\" But now that I'm playing it, I'm invested. \"What else do I need to do?\" And you pop and you look at him.
