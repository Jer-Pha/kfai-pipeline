Greg is off on a secret mission right now. It's not so much a secret, he's a judge this week. We've been talking about this for a couple of weeks now. He's playing all the E3 games before we get to go and play him because he has a million Twitter followers and he's Greg Miller. Yeah, so we're replacing him with Sean Finnegan. Sean, this Sean Finnegan. Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp. Okay, I wrote, thanks for having me. I'm really glad to be here. I think this is my first Gamescast. It is. Yes, it actually is. This is not your first game. Now, Alfredo. Oh, yeah. AKA Alfredo Plays. AKA all up in that ass. I take a gallon now that man and do it. So obviously, you guys are here, which means we're going to talk a little bit about Destiny until you get an Xbox rule in there. Mm-hmm, which is really different for this show because you know",

It looks, we're bringing in a little bit of it. I mean, lately you've been more me easy lately than, 'Oh, yeah, we'll definitely get into that.' He has been super good, man. It's been really busy as we ramp up to E3. We got a Kinda Funny Live right around the corner. I don't have anything to do with that, but I'm very excited for you. It's gonna be good. It's gonna be fun. And then for those that don't know, Sean Finnegan from IGN, you can find him on Fireteam Chat, the Destiny podcast, the number one Destiny podcast. I don't know that to be total fire. Is that true? Uh, you know, it was at one point. I don't know if it is. I think we're gonna call that a, we'll have to call an audible on that one.

But this was a show that was founded by Alfredo Diaz, co-founder. You may know him from way there in the back and back and no, I don't know. We made those shirts. Are they? I left before the whole logo came in. Yeah, for sure. Okay. I was one of like a few people that played Destiny in the vanilla times and was like, 'Oh, we could talk about this is a podcast.' We're still playing this. Yeah. And they're like, 'Mmm.' And they added all that other stuff. Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, I was number two.

Um, Destiny 2, we finally got to see the gameplay reveal today, huh? Here, um, somebody else, she's out. Um, so we saw the Destiny 2 gameplay reveal. I was down in LA. We didn't get to go there ourselves. Greg Miller, because he's a judge. Oh, yeah. You got to play it. You guys sent down Fran, CJ, the rest of the Fireteam Chat, Destin. Yeah, Fran, CJ, Brian Malkiewicz, and Destin are all down there and they're being assisted by some of our LA team. We, it's a, it's a big thing for us. Yeah, yeah, like you said, they, they finally took the top off. Like we've known Destiny 2 was coming for a really long time. I don't think anyone had any hang-ups about it. It was more just like, 'Oh, okay, is it this year, 2017, or is it'",

It was more just like, 'Oh, okay, is it this year, 2017, or is it gonna get pushed to 2018?' And that was a big thing where I feel like a lot of people were shocked that it was confirmed to be this. I was one of them. I had many times on Fireteam Chats thought that September or even holiday 2017 release felt super early to me because, you know, up until a couple of weeks ago when we got our first teaser trailer of that with the release date, with the release date, and that Activision's earning call, they said they, that the team of Bungie was come on track to have a 2017 release. I, we were also playing Rise of Iron and it just seemed kind of outlandish that it would release this year. Hmm, did you have faith? I did. I mean, in terms of like Destiny, it just felt like the original just didn't have much else going for it. And we reached a point where they read like vamp",

And we reached a point where they revamped the old raids. So I just felt like, 'Okay, one, I knew they were already working on Destiny 2.' And in that case, I was like, 'I think, I think with like Activision, they're, they're gonna be trying to push out, trying to get that a little out, stop for anyone, especially with the holiday.' So it's lacking a Halo game. Yep. You know, to compete against, not necessarily they're in the same caliber, but with the history of Bungie and all that, like, I'm sure that has something to do with it. It's really important to note that Activision does see Destiny as one of their new core pillars of their business. Like they refer to it as part of their core business alongside Call of Duty, especially when considering the fact that this last year for Call of Duty 2014, oh, that maybe that audience is feeling a little CoD",

Yes, a little CoD fatigue. We've got one every single year since 2007. And then you had Battlefield come out, big dick swinging, women taking it back. Battlefield 1 was a, yeah, what you guys read on a, not to go on too much of a tangent, but what's the, we read on World War II? I'm sure like the historical event, right? I mean, war enemy. Yeah, glad we got involved. And I used to talk for a cause. I mean, honestly, I've said this multiple times, like I am a huge Modern Warfare 1 and 2 guy. And I literally haven't played a Modern, I haven't played a Call of Duty game since those two. So, but I must have put, you know, 500, 800 hours between the two of the first one. So I would call myself a big guy, but I was literally 10 years ago at this point. So I think it's really interesting that two totally separate development",

So I think it's really interesting that two totally separate development teams came to the idea that, 'Hey, we should go back to World War II,' independently of one another. And now they're both going back there and that seems to have struck a chord with the audience. Well, what do you mean both? Gomez's like Battlefield 1 came with World War I. Got you. Going back instead of going to the future. Yeah, I mean, like I said, not even, not even just Call of Duty having fatigue amongst its audience, but like I think gamers in general, hordes of the future. Yeah, there was like how many games in a row were for doing like a new one? I remember we made recent make fun over at the office. I called you the things are going to be in space. Up, gonna be hilarious. Yeah, I'll get space where I got stuff like that point. Those games always sit like a really cinematic, high-polish, but I do",

Those games always sit like a really cinematic, high-polish, but I do think people were a little fatigued and not just Call of Duty fans, but just general of future space shooters. And I think both companies kind of thought independently of one another, 'Hey, maybe the next one should go back to World War I or World War II,' and that'll be fresh. And lo and behold, it kind of feels that way. Well, Alfredo said a million times like, 'Boots on the ground.' Yeah, yeah, I understand that like people are just sick of like, you know, Call of Duty jetpacking around and happening and they want a more grounded one. And so they're giving people. So going back to Destiny 2, Destin, can't get too far away from all of this. So a couple of the big announcements, Crucible is now 4v4 for all modes. They're going to make Trials, Raids, and the Nightfall available to all players, which is",

So you can kind of be able to jump in and help people finish the the Raids and all that. The PC version of Destiny 2 will be on Blizzard's Battle.net, not using Steam or another platform. Yeah, and although the console versions appear to run at 30 frames per second, Bungie has also confirmed that they cannot talk about Destiny 2 on the Xbox Scorpio until Microsoft's E3 press conference. So we're not sure about that. And Destiny 2 will have an uncapped framerate on PC. And other PC things include 4K resolution support at 3840 by 2160, uncapped frame rate, full mouse and keyboard support with custom key mapping, text chat, adjustable field of view, detailed PC",

Exactly. Quite a lot of times they don't. So it's, you know, and that's, that's the one thing I wanted. I was like, 'Alright, you're going to come out.' Didn't tell me there's going to be a PC version of Destiny. I was like, 'This has got to be a non-shitty, like just whatever port that they toss in there.' And they have to take their time with it. And I think those rumors going on, going around right now that the PC version might not come out at launch date. Yeah, and that's because I wanted these. I, they talked about how they just wanted to be like the best possible. I, you know, saw a PC port and I'm behind that. Like I don't, you know, I don't want to have issues with like",

I played on PC and it was like, when you go to adjust like just in the menus, it was so limited. You're adjusting your menus from like 0 to 10 instead of like, you know, 1.0, 1.1, 3 sensitivity. And I was like, 'This is not, this is a totally terrible PC.' Yeah, I think port carries a kind of negative connotation in games when you say like, 'It's a ported version.' It's like some other team took the game and just like recoded some stuff and put it on a new platform without giving it much thought. And I don't think that that's what the Bungie team is doing with this. And I think that might have some reason, somebody give some credence to this rumor that there it will have a staggered",

Like you mentioned a bunch of the sort of core elements of what that PC version is going to have. But like I think they're really focused on making this the best possible experience for PC enthusiasts because this is a game that should have and arguably was made for that platform in the first place. And the fact that it's the FPS is uncapped. And then there's people taking screenshots from the event of like the aesthetic, like the graphics settings and stuff and seeing that you can go with, you know, the standard, I mean, pretty much standard stuff like foliage and and motion blur and all that. You can, you can adjust everything. I'm like, 'Okay, they're really thinking'",

They want to be able to run that in 4K if their beast of a PC can run it. They want to add like, 'Oh, yes, the one.' They want to be able to do all those different things. So it's gonna be an interesting thing. I was in the control room producing the IGN Live, the IGN presentation of the live stuff, Bungie's live stream. And, you know, James Duggan from IGN was doing graphics, big PC guy. Or me, and the announcement that this PC version was not only real but happening and doing so in coordination with Blizzard was a huge thing for me. Was wigging out because this shows that, you know, Blizzard has a legacy of great competitive multiplayer games and they have a platform and a system by which those games and",

To have a company like that come into the fold and say, 'Hey, we support Destiny,' and not just like tangentially, like, 'Hey, we could support this game,' but we supported enough to bring it on to our own platform. Something that a tried and true launcher with the great security feature set and activation stuff. Like I think that you're anything is that like there's a Blizzard doesn't mess around. It comes there anti-cheat system. Yeah, like we've experienced that with like multiple games and specifically Overwatch as of late. So I know a lot of people are like, 'Well,' or even the people that play PC games, like, 'If you're gonna bring it's over the PC, like you have to have a really solid anti-cheat because PC players will break the'",

So the fact that it's on Battle.net, I know I feel pretty secure about playing Trials or maybe going for World's First during a Raid, thinking like, 'Alright, you know, Blizzard's like anti-cheat client is behind, you know, making sure this is a fair like game.' Mm-hmm. So and then another announcement was that Bungie say in Destiny 2 will launch with new Strikes, PvP modes, and just one Raid. You get three weapon slots that are more flexible than Destiny 1's, called Kinetic, Energy, and Power. Sounds like you'd be able to shuffle your weapons around and use the same types of weapons in multiple spots this time. What's that got to do for you guys? I mean, that sounds like more awesome stuff to me, right? Like one of the things that a year one Destiny players like us kind of always",

And it would be cool to like, 'Let's get a fourth weapon type in there.' Or like, 'Where the SMGs?' We're like, 'We have machine guns and rocket launchers.' And then there are some specialty weapons like Sleeper Simulant, which is a fusion rifle, which is normally a special weapon, but you use it as a heavy. There's kind of interesting weapon types that, but we want, you know, we saw rocket launchers or something like, never saw SMGs. Yeah, I like it. It seems like a much more expansive arsenal.

Bet you're just a four million little carrots on a million. Yeah. Do you think launching with one Raid's enough? Yeah, 100%. Yeah, they, you got to remember, huge. There's also gonna be like a brand new campaign, brand new cinematic campaign. And they, one of the other big features was they announced four new zones, four new major zones, right? We have Titan, we have Nessus, we have Io, which are planetoid, flash planets or moons in our solar system. And then they announced EDZ, which is the European Dead Zone, which is according to their virus food, twice as big as any space that they put in the game currently.

Yeah, there was the second thing's a bottomless hole, like traveling in a circle. Yeah, like there was an expectation that it'd be open-world and it wasn't quite open world. And that was one of the complaints that was levied against the game at its launch that stands to this day. If the European Dead Zone is as big and explorable as they're making it seem like it is, this is going to be a huge amount of content. So many activities and quests and NPCs and enemies to go out and conquer. Between that and the campaign, I think, I'm sorry, campaign, between that and the Raid, I think one Raid is enough considering how complex it, what the Raids are.

But to have one Raid at launch is more than enough. And they talked about it during the stream. Vault of Glass, the first Raid that launched with Destiny 1. 50 percent of the player base got into the Raid. I'll bet you even lower percentage finish the Raid. And then I'll bet you subsequent Raids for like in Dark Below and in Wrath of the Machine and in Taken King, King's Fall, I'll bet you even lower percentages complete it. Does.

Whether it be Trials of Osiris or during a Raid. So just give them that system. You need to give people more reasons to stay in the game. You mean like instead of going out to third-party sites to, you know, look for up to LFG or to look at the lore, like put that into the game. And I've been saying that for years. Like one of the reasons I love kind of a related topic here, like people criticize Destiny 1 for not having a great story. And it doesn't in terms of the campaign.

And it's like the reason I love Mass Effect was because it does that, but it's all in the Codex. You could press Start and just read it. Do that in Destiny. Why? I probably will get this lore wrong because I've, it's been a while since I've read it. But like the two big exotic, you know, in me and I can't cannons, like the one was called The Last Word, the other one was called the Thorn. And like these are like everyone used these weapons.

Why do I have to like learn about this six months down the line? No, it's unlike, you know, a site somewhere else. But the good thing is like I think Bungie learned a lot of lessons from year one. And this is a franchise that they plan to go have go on for 10 years. And I think like you're going to see a lot of evolution happen during there. I mean, we're way past year one at this point. So when we're definitely first launched, I mean, it was kind of seen as a sad game. But the reversal on it will add, but but complete compared to Bungie's that's high-end people were expecting.

To be fair, 7/8 on the internet is like your thing is cracked and everything. That's not the the right word to use. But I think that in it is it had a bad launch. It did surprise. It definitely lived up to expectation. Horrible word of mouth. And I'll never forget seeing you play it for the first time, you just being like, 'Oh, it's not Halo.' And yeah, oh, really? Like I like the, you thought it was tight gameplay wise and you're into all that. But you just playing the game like, 'Oh, man, like this is empty, but there's not much here.' And as they decanter, I think rather that mindset and grew into the more because like I've never personally experienced, you know, and being like, 'Sure, you have like Borderlands or you have like the looters and whatnot.' But like a game where it's just like, 'Well, you have Raids.' Like that's, that's an experience I've never experienced on",
