We were at Andy was telling us about this. That's right. That's right. So by the time this video posts this is gonna be super super old news but still it doesn't matter because it's still worth talking about. So top level of the Fyre Festival for those that don't know um yes Fyre is spelled with a Y not an I. Everyone just assume that it is one of those music festivals like Coachella or it's a destination event. You go it's for like people. It's not for rich people but only rich people can.

Also Starbucks workers going to do that in your place that you're staying and food. Does it include the flight back? But it it includes a lot of things. Not the early supposedly right? So that was the idea of it. And it was they've been promoting this thing for months. Uh Ja Rule was big old Ja Rule partnered with uh this this he's co-sponsoring it with this 5-year-old dude. Don't know his name. It doesn't **** matter. **** that guy. um who is this entrepreneurial like brat that has a lot of money and it's just like we're gonna **** like reading interviews with this guy.

We're going to have people go out to this remote island that was once owned by Pablo Escobar and it's going to be it's going to be a good time for everybody. They put out a hype video trailer for it and it was **** hype as **** Wasn't Yeah. They had a bunch of models and it wasn't Emily Ratajkowski. Emily Ratajkowski uh was used in the imagery to promote it. She wasn't in the act in the in the trailer. There was a lot of women in the trailer though. Um very scantily clad. Lot of drone shots an excessive amount of drone shots. This **** looked cool. It looked really cool. The island gorgeous. Like super beautiful.

And they're just like \"Hey guys sorry to any fans that wanted to see us there. it the production's just not up to snuff for us. Like we just don't feel like we can put on the show that our fans they were about safety they said too and yeah they're just like the safety guidelines aren't aren't there like you know we're just not there but it was just like cool that that was that they backed out.

People started showing up and they were promised that the whole event was going to be in in some giant dome. Dome wasn't there. They were told that they each had um glamping tents right up to a certain level quality. Instead they were leftover disaster relief tents. Most of which now big tents but not glamping. Big tents by any stretch. Most of them not even complete missing walls. Glamping. So I've glamped before because you know my wife.

One I was like \"Dude we're going to go out into the **** deserts of Morocco. It's going to be cool. We're going to ride camels. It's going to be so quiet and like we're going to get an actual like taste of like what it's like to be out there.\" We get there and it is just a bunch of **** Americans drinking Budweiser and screaming all night.

And was it a beetle with the horns? Yeah. Was it like a scarab from The Mummy? It looked like one of those right? Especially when it's like 4:00 in the morning. All you have is literally candlelight or your phone. And I'm like I have to deal with this thing and hope it doesn't bite me. And I got it. I was fine. It doesn't bite or anything like that.

That was where I wrote the camels where I did the the famous Camel Butt video that you can see on um on my Instagram. No Peanut and Pumpkin were in the Riad that we went to in the Mid Atlas Mountains. Um we stayed at a very nice Riad which is which is a Richard Branson property that was um **** amazing.

They are getting on their like these these people that they were told we're going to take them. They go plane's not there on time. The airplane terminals are just backed up to hell.

They were promised uh gourmet meals for every meal. And uh what turns out the uh the gourmet uh caterers that they had pulled out days before the event right? Cuz yeah they didn't get paid. So like \"Fuck this. We're not doing it.\" So instead they gave everybody for breakfast lunch and dinner this styrofoam **** container with just two shitty pieces of like toast.

Just look up Fyre Festival food. It's the saddest picture you'll ever see. If you type in Fyre Festival into Google and then just look at all the Google images and we can just pull that up. So anyway the food's a disaster and then eventually the the whole thing just gets cancelled but then everyone gets stranded on this island. the government gets involved. Yeah this is the thing I I I I had never heard of Fyre Festival and it was already trending by the time I figured it out. And so when I was looking at it was all people people there putting out tweets begging like the U.S. Government to come ex Why do I do this every time? Screw get them out of there. Exfiltrate.

Meanwhile all their luggage put in these **** Metal Gear Solid V containers. All of their **** just thrown in there. Everyone's luggage thrown together. Okay they get there. The people that do get their uh day negative one I guess uh lands and they're like \"Where's our shit?\" They open up the **** thing and it's just like \"Go get your stuff.\" Guess what?

It's Ja Rule. I have a quick question. Go on the whole Fyre Festival. What is it with destination festivals in general? Just go. But why to go and get sweaty and dirty and nasty? It's No it's fun. Because I've gone to Stagecoach or Ragecoach you know where you just basically get drunk see a bunch of country acts and it's just filthy nasty. Granted it's a lot of fun but it's nasty.

I don't know how everything went so left but I'm working to make it right by making sure everyone is refunded. I truly apologize as this is not my fault but I'm not taking responsibility but I'm taking responsibility. I'm deeply sorry to everyone who is in inconvenience by this. So I mean a couple inconsistencies there but overall I think the sentiment was in that statement of like he feels bad.

But you couldn't just do like a video quick video. Same. None of his PR people are like let Ja Rule be on camera right now. Someone was like let's just we'll edit what he's written and put it out. Hey Ja what you got? He's just oh no everybody lose a lot of money. It's like oh **** not them. That was a good song. Um to answer your question I don't know right?

I I would granted this is me saying that never having gone to Alsand never having gone to Coachella. would love to see what Coachella is like but I would like to experience it like how I imagine uh Beyonce experiences it where she stays at the mansion gets flown in by a helicopter dropped off performs for a second and then walks the **** out and like gets back on the helicopter and goes. Yeah that would be the bomb. I just like watching on YouTube clicking around the bull. You're not one of those people. Well you get sunburned very easily so you should just stay out of",

Well you also don't like live music right? Cuz I mean you you show you like shows but like but is I love live music that I love. I don't want to **** go see Migos perform. Like the **** Nah. Nah. Blink-182. I would get down with that. Would you go to Linkin Park? Huh? Would you go to Linkin Park? Hell yeah. Huge Linkin Park fan. That'd be **** fantastic. I'm asking Tim. Excuse me. That would be fantastic. So back to the topic of Fyre Festival. What I did yesterday was go on YouTube and just type in Fyre Festival and just try to watch some videos. Sure.

It's 10 minutes and it is a Casey Neistat style vlog of him. It's an edited video of him going throughout his day doing his whole the whole packing for Fyre Festival. Yep exactly. It starts off and he's packing stuff and it's like a bunch of like crazy drone shots of the island and all this cool **** and like planes landing and stuff and it looks **** awesome. Hot girls diving into water and just swimming around and laughing and drinking. It's just like it looked like a Tupac video. Like it was dope and he just keeps going",

Oh okay. So it's like they they had nothing to do with the production hype. These guys they were just all hype. So they were the ones that shot the hype trailer all that stuff. So they have their own like private building on the island. One of the only buildings on the island is theirs. They're there chilling having a good time. They're drinking having like they're like \"Oh it's the Fyre Festival's tomorrow. Everyone's flying in. It's going to be a great time.\" And they're all drinking and then",

They're for some reason they're diverting everybody that lands over there. I think it's a pre-party. Uh we're just going to go check it out.\" And then it goes and he's just such a bro. And he's just like having the best time ever with the hanging out with the looks so sad like just the whole experience. But it's a beautiful island. Uh this isn't what I'm talking about. Same dude though. But yeah like you can see how it's shot right? Where there's just like this whole it's very cinematic telling the whole story and he's like I can't wait for tomorrow.

He's like \"What the **** is that?\" But like it's all in between beautiful fantasy land and **** And then all of a sudden he just like he's like looking at his phone. He's like he's on a call and he gets off. He's like he looks his friend. Hey hey David. Hey dude. They canceled the festival there. And then it just **** takes a turn for the worst. And it reminded me of the movie Club Dread where it's like they all go to this **** island and all of a sudden it turns into a horror movie and he's just like \"Oh **** are you kidding me? What do you mean? Wait we all need to get off the the government's involved.\" And like it just turns into **** panic.",

No cuz it's on a different like island. You got to swim over there. This and it just gets so bad. But the fact that there was a vlog documenting this I'm like \"All right we got it from the the good side. There's vlogs.\" I kept clicking around. There's people that are just like \"My girlfriend is in that tent. They won't let me in the tent.\" And he's just like crying. Jesus. My thing is this. Like and sometimes truth is stranger than fiction right? If this were a movie I would go see it. Seth Rogen uh picked up the rights. Oh did he **** really already? Of course he did.

It is so and like you you write it from the perspective of the guys that are like stuck in that building and like it's chaos outside and everyone just starts eating each other.
