They're up there all month long and here I am going to answer all of those right now. Thank you very much for all your support. It means the world. Let's get right to it. We don't got to do anything fancy, right, Kev? Yeah, there you go. I like the background. Good job on this. It's very pretty, very pretty. Let's get right into it. James Davis says, \"Hey, first-time producer, longtime seducer.\" I like that. That's a new one. \"So my question involves Colin and the community. I become more active on the forums just before the time he left and it felt like there was a constant stream of hate towards the whole situation. It was a major turnoff, so I stayed away for a while. Community is important to me and this soured the otherwise great impression I've had from the Best Friends, the little TM.\" Son, appreciate that. Uh, so my question, how has the community",

Uh, so my question, how has the community adapted since Colin's departure? I.E., is there still an uproar? Has there been a noticeable decrease/increase of subscribers? Do you expect any awkwardness at KFL 3, etc.? Thanks for all the amazing content you guys produce, James.\" So obviously, for anybody that's been involved, uh, in Kinda Funny and all the things that we do, Colin leaving was a major change. Probably, actually, no, 100% the most major change we've ever had. Uh, we had the studio, we hired Kevin, we hired, um, Andy, and you know, like we've been doing a lot of things like that. We've added new shows, we've, uh, had shows go away, we've done live shows. All of these things, as crazy as they they might be or as different and, um, radical as they seemed at the time, nothing is equivalent to one-fourth of the founding members of the company leaving.

Obviously, Colin's imprint on Kinda Funny will always be there and we will always have that as the foundation for what we're doing. But yeah, no, it's going to cause an uproar and especially when Colin had such a, or has such a vocal fan base, um, and, uh, a group of people that are dedicated to him and his vision. And when his vision and our vision didn't exactly align, that is going to cause a rift in the community and we're dealing with that and it's very difficult and it's hard and it hurts a lot to see a lot of the negativity, um, between both sides going back and forth, uh, when it doesn't even need to be such a taking side situation.

Uh, we are doing the survey and we've been looking a lot of feedback and yeah, there is issues with Kinda Funny. We are well aware of it and we're working on all those things. It's just things don't happen overnight.

Um, for example, we are constantly trying to come up with the best way to do what we're doing and to get it out there to all the people. But whatever idea we have, some people like it, some people don't. And they think that when we don't listen to their criticisms, that we're not listening to the community.

Yeah, I mean, for me, like I I it's so hard to respond to a negative comment when I feel like they're being like people are being like just like rude or like luckily like I'm very lucky in the sense that like I didn't see a lot of animosity when it all happened.

I am so involved in this stuff and I care about Kinda Funny so much that I want people to be happy.

The reason that we are announcing a lot of things at Kinda Funny Live 3 is we needed that time to plan it, to plan and to get all of our ideas together.

Anthony Camilo, AKA Peanut043, the homie says, \"Who's the most influential artist of the last 20 years? My answer is Kanye, but I'm a Kanye fanboy, so I'm biased. Also, is it too early to say that Beyonc\u00e9 has surpassed Michael Jackson?\" Oh boy, there's a lot of things here. First off, no one will ever surpass Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson is and forever will be the King of Pop. Uh, Beyonc\u00e9, I mean, dude, she's the queen and she definitely has made her mark in a way where she's going to go down as a legend.

This was back when they were like first together, Crazy in Love days, a little after that. Um, and we were talking about money and how successful they are. And I was like, \"Oh, there's no way Beyonc\u00e9 makes more money than Jay-Z. Like Jay-Z is the s***, man.\" And, uh, they were like, \"No, dude, like Beyonc\u00e9 definitely.\" And me and Amanda Sherman, one of my really good friends, got into this huge fight. And then we started looking it up and I was like, \"I am so f***ing wrong. Beyonc\u00e9 makes so much more money than Jay-Z, always has and always f***ing will.\" She is a powerhouse and together they are a powerhouse couple.

He just did so much right and, uh, at such a high standard of quality that I don't think anybody could ever hit that magic again, especially when he had such a unique sound. Do you think like things were different also with like the amount of money that he could, Michael Jackson could make versus how much money Beyonc\u00e9 makes? Like, is more money being, is more music being bought now? No. Okay. But there's definitely more revenue streams than there used to be. Yeah.

The most influential artist, I mean, to be fair, I am a hip-hop guy, so I kind of lean into that. I I can't think of any artist post-'97 in any other genre that really hit me. Um, so I I might say Kanye because whether or not you like the guy, his decisions on the sound and aesthetics of his albums have set the trend for what everyone else in hip-hop is trying to achieve time after time after time. He turned Auto-Tune into an art form, not just the T-Pain, I'm just using it with 808s & Heartbreak. And then everybody tried doing that. Didn't necessarily work, but they did.

And then obviously with, um, Yeezus, just that industrial noise was everywhere and it still kind of is. So anyway, I I agree with you on on the Kanye front. But let me know in the comments how wrong I am and who I'm forgetting about, 'cause I'm sure that there's some amazing people.
