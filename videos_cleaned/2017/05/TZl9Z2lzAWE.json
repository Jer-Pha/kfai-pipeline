I'm a huge Halo, I am maybe the world's biggest like Halo-ologist/Fanboy. Okay, cool. Well, this should be fun. Where's your kind of status with Halo at this point? It's been my life. Like, I mean, you know, it's that that's that was my introduction into shooters and then from there like that's it made me who I was today. Like, I'm known for shooting games and I do well in shooters and it all originated with Halo. Has your interest waned at all in the franchise? Uh, yeah, it definitely has. Uh, I think 5 in terms of campaign was a little lackluster. I really enjoyed the multiplayer, um, a lot. I think Halo 5's multiplayer is like the Counter-Strike for consoles where there's no, there's no aim assist and there's a huge like, um, hardcore learning curve, which I love about it. Yeah, I mean, I don't think anyone would contest that Halo's influence as a shooter",

Yeah, I mean, I don't think anyone would contest that Halo's influence as a shooter has kind of dwindled, uh, over the past couple years. Like, it used to be like when Halo 3 released, like that sold on day one like 10 million copies. Like, it, no, on day one, over time, over time. Yeah, something broke all sorts of records, right? Yeah, it did top out. I, I have stats. Yeah, uh, Halo 4, sorry, Halo 3, it worldwide sold 1.1 million. Yeah, now, which for an exclusive single bound, like single console game is an absurd number. Yeah, and that was in 2007. So like, it's crazy, right? But Halo isn't seeing those numbers now. Also, Xbox itself is in a tough spot compared to PS4 when it comes to units out in the market. So it's kind of, it's on the fritz a little bit, but the game itself has never been better. Uh, the way they've evolved the speed, the way they've evolved the features, multiplayer, multiplayer, I mean, I",

Yeah, I mean, like, I criticize the campaign just like everyone because it's not interesting and it's not a good story, but what you're doing in the campaigns, uh, is a lot of fun. They like, you're basically playing alongside Spartans the whole time. They can revive you and stuff. There's awesome cool mechanics that work in that regard. They introduced this whole buildup between like Chief and Locke. I know, I know, like I said, I'm not even talking about the story for like two seconds and all of a sudden like Spartans, but like they introduced like branching paths, like multiple ways and like walls you could tear down as a Spartan. Like you felt and all the new Spartan abilities just felt really like updated and fast and like you felt very powerful as a Spartan.",

Um, so they did a lot of really interesting stuff to change the gameplay and I think the gameplay has never been better. Like I think it's the best since it's been since Halo 2. Yep, I completely agree with that. Because of that, like I still play Halo multiplayer every day. Like it's so much fun. I, I, I'm the only one in the office who now still plays it, but like I still play all the time because it's so much fun and it is very, it's a gun skill game. Like it is a steep learning curve. It's hard to be good at and that's the type of game I gravitate to. I'm a Counter-Strike guy. So, yep. So look at like since we were talking about numbers a little bit earlier, uh, in terms of the franchise history, yeah, Halo 3 was its peak at 10 million. Halo 4 hit 9.8.",

So not, not much less. Halo 4 is good. Um, then Master Chief Collection, 3.4, troubled launch, troubled launch. And it's, it's a remaster, it's old games, old games. Um, Halo 5 at 4.7. So that's where you did see that kind of steep drop off. But what you're saying is very accurate where there's just not as many Xbox One. Also take a look at, at the time. Yeah, also take a look at, okay, four point, what was it? 4.7, 4.7 million units sold for any exclusive, for an exclusive game that doesn't have Halo attached to it is still a strong sales number, right? So like what did, uh, we're talking about like what I'm trying to think of a Sony, like what did sell in that realm? I'm pretty sure some of them are up in the eight realm as well, but some of them also were down in the four. So yeah, so like when you're talking about",

So you're just, what you're doing is you're comparing like Halo's kind of decline in its influence and relevance where it's still, it's still very big. Mhm. You know, absolutely. I mean, it isn't the Call of Duty level, but that's because Call of Duty is on multiple, there's multiple SKUs across everything. Yeah, that and also just Call of Duty is like, it is the greatest, it is the biggest selling game in games, maybe minus like Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto. But, um, so the thing with, with Halo as well, so then there's the other games like Halo Wars, for example. Halo Wars, uh, the original topped out at 2.6 million. Absurd for that game, dude.

Your brother was really, my brother was super into it and I was into it because like I just wanted more of the Halo Universe, you know? So the story of Halo Wars and the cutscenes are really, really good. Blur, man, Blur, great stuff. But that like, that is so mind-boggling to me because that's an RTS on a console. Like RTS is in games just in general, even on PC, aren't a big genre, a big thing right now. StarCraft's trying to make a comeback though. Yeah, but they're always trying to make it come back. I love StarCraft. I think in a perfect world, StarCraft would be the highest viewed esport because it is the one with the highest skill cap and it's the most difficult in terms of like strategy and gameplay and stuff.

It's kind of hard to say it's a big exclusive, but it does have Halo in the name. Uh, as of the end of April, so after two months of it happened because it came out, uh, late February, 250k sold. Mhm. Which is not a failure, good sales for the level that went into that, but it is not a huge hit. I mean, I might qualify this as a failure. We talked about this on Podcast Unlocked, another show which I'm kind of like the rotating chair on. Um, this is a game that didn't really see an effective level of marketing like the first game did really, really well in terms, in terms of what it was for the franchise. You're attaching Halo to it.

You would have thought that they put a, a little bit of marketing, like put some TV ads out, try and get the name out there, try to get people interested in this and you didn't really see a lot of that going out there and I think it contributed to the game not selling all that well. But at the end of the day, regardless of it being Halo, it's an RTS. Yeah, on console too. Well, it sold well over time though. You know, we're only two months into this and we'll, so we'll see. Talking about Halo Wars 2 now, so that number won't go up that much. I think back in the day though, no one was talking about Halo Wars. It was kind of just, it was that slow crawl. I, I agree with you. I don't think this thing is going to be a runaway hit. There's no way it even in my mind even hits like the million. Yeah.",

Even like maybe if it becomes like a promotional tool like later on down the road, you see it on Games with Gold for a discounted price, then maybe people will pick it up. Um, but see that's where I think those numbers are going to start getting up there a bit more because that's where you see something. It's discounted. The Halo name alone is just like, oh cool, I'm interested. But yeah, it being an RTS on a console, it limits the like amount of people are even interested so much. Yeah, you can even play this on PC too, because the Xbox is all Windows thing and it's still. Yeah.

Having said that, it is still the biggest exclusive that Microsoft has. Uh, Gears of War behind it and not including like Fable and all that stuff just because I don't, I don't know anything about that. Um, and those games are almost annual. It's a really big franchise, but not Halo status. Yeah. So, um, I want to talk about the future of, of Halo and when we think we're going to see Halo 6 and everything we know so far. So here are the facts. Earlier this year, Phil Spencer said he's incredibly proud of 2017's Xbox lineup, adding that it's going to be an interesting year for us because we don't have Gears, we don't have a Halo first-person shooter game. So he's saying we do not have either of those this year, which Xbox needs exclusives. They do and not having",

They do and not having those two is rough, especially when you have a new console launching. I honestly at this point, I'm down for new, like new exclusives. Like I get, I, I always love my Gears, I always love my Halo, but I need, I need new characters and new worlds to like sink my teeth into. Okay. Uh, in a post on Reddit, 343 Community Manager Brian Jarrard, AKA Sketch343, you guys don't know, I don't know, uh, tempered fans expectations for E3, saying that while the studio will have something at E3, it won't be tied to Halo 6. He said, quote, I'll slip into my Dream Crusher persona for a minute in the name of realistic expectations. We've said this already, but we'll have a little something at E3, but it's not related to the next major entry in the franchise.

And then, uh, Frankie O'Connor, uh, said on the story of it, we very much realized that people wanted Master Chief's story in Halo 5. We definitely marketed in a way that we had hoped was going to bring surprise, but for some fans and certainly fans of Master Chief, it was a huge disappointment because they wanted more Chief. It wasn't that surprising to me, O'Connor continued, but the volume of give us more Chief at the end of Halo 5 was significant. And so I think if anything, he's slightly more important now than he's ever been, certainly to our franchise. The focus for the franchise now will not be on bringing in new characters or expanding the number of playable characters. Instead, 343 will be making the world a little",

And additionally, early this year at 343 Industries Studio Head Bonnie Ross confirmed that all future FPS Halo games will have split-screen multiplayer. F*** yes, yes, big feature amongst the Halo hardcore. Um, there's a lot I disagree and agree with in there. Like I don't, I don't actually necessarily think that bringing on new playable characters is a bad thing, right? Like no, people look at Halo 2, right? There's a big section of the game that's playable as the Arbiter, right? I actually hated that section. Okay, maybe you guys didn't like it and maybe it's divisive, but there are a lot of people who thought that that was really cool.

Give me the Chief. Like I'm all in, all in invested in the Chief and Cortana. But yeah, I'd like to see, you know, new Spartan characters or maybe new Covenant characters or whatnot that make a, make a stand. I mean, the universe that Halo has fleshed out for itself is so awesome and I do think that there's this like wealth of characters and stuff that you could bring into the story. Uh, and yes, some might, in my opinion, like one or two more. Like again, a new playable character isn't necessarily a bad thing in my mind.

Like, well, even then they built, they, they built it up to be this one big thing between Locke and, and, and Chief and it wasn't. Yeah. So like if you were a, I mean, I follow, remember like Hunt the Truth, that podcast and stuff. There was all this great backstory to the ONI and what the press outside of, uh, the military was saying about these two characters and about like the situation that Master Chief seemingly created and then just ejected from. It seemed like there was going to be and even the trailers, the trailers that kind of had like two different perspectives from Chief's perspective and Locke's perspective suggested that Halo 5 would delve into",

Yeah, and that sounds awesome because you know what that sounds like to me? Mass Effect 1, where you come in and you're Commander Shepard and you're the first human Spectre and your first thing is, all right, you're the first human Spectre. We don't trust you because we don't trust humans. You guys are young and stupid according to the council, but you have to go over, you have to go after Saren, our longest running, most cunning and smart Spectre.

And that if Halo could have done even just a part of that in Halo 5, I don't think you'd see many people complaining and I think you'd see a greater attachment to Locke. But it didn't do that. So I think that sucks. But I don't think that you can lump in what I just said with no new more, no new characters. Obviously we want Chief more because they was only in the game like three missions. Uh, but I'm not going to go all the way and say I only ever want to play Master Chief ever because there's been times in the past like in Halo 2 where I thought it the game benefited from a different perspective.

However, when Xbox is in the situation it is right now where they are like second and they want to be first and they are launching a new console that is really trying to say, hey, this is why we're better than them. Come here. You need those sticking points and not having a Gears and Halo. That sounds like a mistake to me. Now the thing is Halo 3, I don't think they're going to do the Anniversary thing.

And Xbox is in a tough spot right now because, you know, like confirmed their heavy, two of their big heavy hitters aren't going to be part of this year's E3.

So they're saying no Halo 6 at E3. The thing to keep in mind about that, some timing is Halo 4",

The thing to keep in mind about that, some timing is Halo 4 was announced at E3 2011 and then came out 2012, sorry, November 2012. Um, Halo 5 announced E3 2013, came out October 2015. So the two years. So going off of that, it would make sense for them to announce Halo this year if it's going to come out. We're in a special spot though, because I think that originally they announced Halo 5, 6, 7 as a trilogy. And then not long after they walked that back. But I do believe that they had tied story elements from 5 into 6 and that those were going to be kind of part one and part two of whatever major story for Chief going forward. And then with the reaction to Locke, I'll bet you they had to walk a lot of that back, you know, write that character out, shift the narrative, make it like refocus it on Chief and Cortana, which ended up overall playing a smaller",
