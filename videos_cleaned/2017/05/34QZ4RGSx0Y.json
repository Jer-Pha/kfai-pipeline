If you were in charge of making that happen, what kind of game would it be? What would it be about? It's interesting because you look at the exclusive game right now, right? Nintendo in its own little world. It'll always be there. It's going to have its IP and it is what it is. But when you look at Xbox versus PlayStation, we've discussed the exclusive thing to death at this point. Sure, where it's like, all right, PlayStation's very much succeeding in its exclusives.",

Sure, where it's like, all right, PlayStation's very much succeeding in its exclusives. Xbox is not doing so well. This year has been PlayStation, PlayStation, PlayStation. And it's like Xbox seems like it's going to hit eventually, but whatever. And busted its load a little bit like the last couple years with its big guys with, uh, well, yeah, canceling all exclusives. It's had Halo 5 came out, Master Chief Collection before that, Gears. It's like that, those are kind of their, the big franchises. So it's like, all right, Horizon is very, and then for, yeah, is there another need for a shooter? No, don't think so. Is it a big RPG? I don't even know like what, well, if the question is like, if I can have any, any game that my answer to this question has always been that I would make a Justice League game that's just like Arkham. Like I would make a Justice League game. So there's tons of them. We're in a",

It's like much bigger scale than a regular Arkham game, but that's the tone that I would want, right? And that's the thing I've always said, does it make sense as an Xbox exclusive? Probably not. So for them to fill a gap, I think they need an, an RPG. See, I, I don't know, man. I, I would argue that they do that. I think that does fill the gap because I think here's the thing with open, either here's what the, well, I mean, look at Horizon, right? And all that stuff. The, the thing I think it's pretty clear that Xbox has been trying to chase is the adult gamer who would be story driven and like, hey, we don't have an Uncharted. I think Esports too. Sure.

Uh, Uncharted, Horizon, being excited for Detroit, right? And you see Xbox go like, all right, cool. We're going to get Tomb Raider's exclusivity. But Tomb Raider comes with so much baggage, at least, you know, for a year. So much baggage. It doesn't move the units. And then when it comes to PlayStation, does new as well and everybody's getting screwed in that deal, right? And then you're like, all right, cool. Then what we want to do is we'll make our own. Let's get Quantum Break. Quantum Break comes out and just doesn't perform well because it's still very much anchored in old Xbox of like, no, no, it's, it's the melding of TV and games. And everybody's like, yeah, I did. I actually really like, I liked it a lot too. But I understand why it didn't. It was sent out",

Stop with the goddamn gimmicks. Yeah, exactly. But it was cool and it was interesting and different. But whatever. Like, I think sitting down and being like, taking a page from Sony and being like, all right, cool. You have Spider-Man. We're doing this. And the fact that Marvel is already playing ball that way and doing all these different things and letting Spider-Man be exclusive. And we talked about it before, right? Of like, well, what does it mean for the other games they're working on in Avengers and this and that? I think we did look. The Marvel/DC thing could be interesting there.

Like that kind of stuff. There'd be all trash talking. But if it came out and it was freaking awesome, makes it, yeah, I mean, that's, can you freaking imagine? Like, all right, cool. Yeah, Rocksteady is making the Justice League. Is literally my answer to that question for the last like decade. I think it's been like, this is the game that you make. And that's the thing is because then you're taking what movies are doing and what they're doing where they're, you know what I love about Marvel is the fact they're like, all right, cool. Tell, tell, you're great at stories. Take this. Uh, Square, you guys are good with a whole bunch of stuff. Here you go. Make this Avengers game. Rumored to be making another",

Make this Avengers game. Rumored to be making another Guardians game. Like that. Let's just take our properties and not try to do them in-house and do them mediocre. Let's go find the best studios to partner with and make the mix stuff. I mean, I loved Fable. Uh, like the first Fable game was one of my favorite games. Like, I love that game so much. So it's like that's a property that doesn't exist anymore that almost filled a gap. And then it was open world. It was RPG. But one thing that I, I think like is definitely missing is a Bloodborne or a Nioh. Like, sure, Xbox has Dark Souls as well. But like, if there was a game like that, that's what I wanted Scalebound to be. And that game's been canceled. So, you know, there's a ton of gaps right now.

Yeah, I mean, that's, and that was I think a wakeup call Xbox in a lot of ways of like, well, we have these, these sell. These are who our gamers are. And I do think that that's true. But I think the gamers have grown up in a lot of ways where it's like just chainsaws and Master Chief aren't enough right now. Yeah, I think it needs an, an answer to Uncharted. Like it needs a AAA. This is a movie game experience that that's not Tomb Raider. Like, and even like Tomb Raider is great, but it's like you need something that is like a Naughty Dog game, you know? And I don't think there's anybody necessarily that can, can do that. I mean, to, and like this is, I, we, we've had this discussion on this show, right? Avengers hasn't announced platforms. Correct?

We're taking that. And this is, and it would be the same thing, but it would be the, you know, Crystal Dynamics and working on it, right? Of being like, all right, here's our game and this is what it is. And it's the same thing as Tomb Raider though in the argument if they could just come out and be like, no, this is exclusive to this platform. It is not. Yeah, exactly. Tomb Raider every time like E3, here it is. And then an hour later E3, like, well, they're going back and forth and they're using this.

I hate it when people ask me this stuff because I'm like, I cannot tell you what your preference is. I don't know what you prefer. Uh, if you travel a lot, get the Switch. Uh, if you probably prefer shorter experiences that you are more likely to play by yourself, maybe get PlayStation VR. But there's also like VR is pretty rad. Like if, if you happen to really like that tech and you haven't tried it, PSVR is a great way to do that. It's very easy. Yeah. Um, if you can find one, you can't find a Switch either. So there's that. There's, and I feel, but I feel like it's that thing where a year ago we would have been more bullish the other way or one way or the other.

And it's like, I'm a little bit lucky that I work in the industry and have all my friends have it. But it's just like, I'm sure you can find somebody if you really wanted to play that would let you borrow it for a weekend. They probably own all five awesome experiences that you can do them all and then you're done. It's pretty easy to say that you'll get more time out of Switch than you would out of PSVR just with Zelda alone. So yeah, yeah. And that's the thing. Cheating. And it's the same.

Did someone really inspire you to cover video games? And was IGN your dream? So, um, I think my answer to this is very similar to most other people's and that it was a complete accident. Uh, I was working in this terrible job in, in a call center, which I hated. So naturally I was looking for jobs elsewhere. And, uh, I'd always loved writing. I'd always loved games.

That was like five years ago in May. I think my first article was published May 6th. So like kind of soon. Um, what was it? What was the other half of that question? Was IGN the dream? I wanted to work at a place like IGN or GameSpot. Uh, for sure. And I wouldn't say like that I had that like one goal, but it was definitely I wanted to work in the US because the industry is so much bigger here and there's kind of a ceiling in Australia. Um, so it was definitely like one of the bigger websites, but it wasn't IGN specifically. I'm pretty happy there though. Yeah.

Damn it, friend. It's funny how many times I've heard that exact thing, but I've never experienced it myself. Um, but yeah, I mean, you definitely work way harder than even I would have thought.

Those like actual mainstream news organizations who didn't take game reviews or games journalism as seriously as IGN does. So like that's something that I think feel like really needs to be spoken about. And like when we do those ranking lists or game of the year list, people are in a room arguing. People are yelling. People are angry at each other. At no point is this like, maybe they'll give us some money. Let's just like email Activision. See what happens there. Not a thing. So that's like something that I didn't expect to be as serious as it was, but I like it. Graham Hughes wants to know which Switch cartridge tastes the best. I assume they all taste bad.

It was, uh, Zelda and Skylanders. I was drunk. That's my excuse. And, uh, they were both equally terrible. I also actually speaking of Steve, I tried to make him taste one. I tried very hard. It's like, I have this recorded because I was drunk and I was very rude about it. He didn't do it. He was like, I'm not doing that. I was like, Steve, lick it. You didn't. He didn't do it.

So that is like the biggest problem is, is finding the time. It's also like, it's very hard for me to respond to things. Like I make videos about lifestyle stuff or current news. Like I did a Pepsi ad reaction video, which was like, okay, I know I have to do this right now. But how do I find the time to do that? It's really hard to respond to things immediately. But, but, um, yeah, I don't know. I, I block out time. I plan things literally months in advance.
